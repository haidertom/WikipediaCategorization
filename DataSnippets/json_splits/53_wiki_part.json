Local congregations have far-reaching powers concerning \"controversial\" matters (such as admittance to [[holy communion]] or whether women are admitted as members of the congregation's [[Session (Presbyterianism)|consistory]]).\n\n==Organization==\nThe polity of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands is a hybrid of [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] and [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalist]] church governance. Church governance is organised along local, regional, and national lines. At the local level is the congregation. An individual congregation is led by a church council made of the minister along with [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] and [[deacon]]s elected by the congregation. At the regional level were 75 classical assemblies whose members are chosen by the church councils. As of 1st May 2018, these 75 classical assemblies are reorganised into 11 larger ones. At the national level is the General [[Synod]] which directs areas of common interest, such as theological education, ministry training and ecumenical co-operation.<ref name=organisation>[http://www.protestantchurch.nl/info.aspx?page=1509# Organisation of the PKN]. Accessed July 14, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe PKN has four different types of congregations:\n# Protestant congregations: local congregations from different church bodies that have merged\n# Dutch Reformed congregations\n# Reformed congregations (congregations of the former Reformed Churches in the Netherlands)\n# Lutheran congregations (congregations of the former Evangelical-Lutheran Church)\n\nLutherans are a minority (about 1 percent) of the PKN's membership. To ensure that Lutherans are represented in the Church, the Lutheran congregations have their own synod. The Lutheran Synod also has representatives in the General Synod.<ref name=organisation/>\n\n==Statistical details==\nThe Protestant Church in the Netherlands issues yearly reports regarding its membership and finances.<ref name=\"PKN Statistische Jaarbrief 2017\">[https://www.protestantsekerk.nl/download/CAwdEAwUUkRBXEU=&type=pdf PKN Statistische Jaarbrief 2017]</ref>\n\nIts make-up by former affiliation of its congregations was as follows in 2017:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" font-size:80%;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:100%\" |Members of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands by type of congregation (2017)<ref name=\"PKN Statistische Jaarbrief 2017\">[https://www.protestantsekerk.nl/download/CAwdEAwUUkRBXEU=&type=pdf PKN Statistische Jaarbrief 2017]</ref>\n|-\n!

Then, it spread to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other large cities in the west. Finally the Catholic southern areas showed religious declines. A countervailing trend is produced by a religious revival in the Protestant [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Bible Belt]], and the growth of Muslims and Hindu communities resulting from immigration and high birth rates.<ref name=\"Knippenberg1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Knippenberg|first1=Hans|journal=GeoJournal|volume=45|issue=3|year=1998|pages=209\u2013220|issn=03432521|doi=10.1023/A:1006973011455|title=Secularization in the Netherlands in its historical and geographical dimensions\n}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first1=Tom\u00e1\u0161|last1= Sobotka|first2= Feray|last2= Adig\u00fczel|title=Religiosity and spatial demographic differences in the Netherlands|date=2002|hdl=11385/169984 }}</ref>\nResearch in 2007 concluded that 42% of the members of the PKN were [[non-theist]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=God in Nederland (1996-2006)|first1=Ronald |last1=Meester|first2= G.|last2= Dekker|isbn=9789025957407}}</ref> Furthermore, in the PKN and several other smaller denominations of the Netherlands, one in six clergy were either agnostic or atheist.<ref name=PKN-Hendrikse>{{cite news|last=Pigott|first=Robert|title=Dutch rethink Christianity for a doubtful world|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14417362|accessdate=2 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Youtube|id=n6TuZ9F-PGo}}</ref> A minister of the PKN, [[Klaas Hendrikse]] has described God as \"a word for experience, or human experience\" and said that Jesus may have never existed.<ref name=\"PKN-Hendrikse\" /><ref>{{Youtube|id=9eypysiJQgw}}</ref>\n\n==Separations==\n[[File:Ontstaansgeschiedenis van kerken in Nederland.jpg|thumb|right|History of the churches in the  Netherlands]]\nOnly those congregations belonging to the former Reformed Churches in the Netherlands have the legal right to secede from the PKN without losing its property and church during a transition period of 10 years. Seven congregations have so far decided to form the [[Continued Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]].<ref name=3wayPKN/> Two congregations have joined one of the other smaller Reformed churches in the Netherlands. Some minorities within congregations that joined the PKN decided to leave the church and associated themselves individually with one of the other Reformed churches.\n\nSome congregations and members in the Dutch Reformed Church did not agree with the merger and have separated. They have organized themselves in the [[Restored Reformed Church]]. Estimations of their membership vary from 35,000 up to 70,000 people in about 120 local congregations.<ref>[http://www.hersteldhervormdekerk.nl/website/gemeenten Official website Restored Reformed Church]</ref> They disagree with the pluralism of the merged church which maintains, as they see it, contradicting Reformed and Lutheran confessions.

Page 29</ref> The [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell movement]] began as two separate threads, each without knowledge of the other, during the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century. The first of these two groups, led by [[Barton W. Stone]] began at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky|Cane Ridge]], [[Bourbon County, Kentucky]]. The group called themselves simply ''Christians''. The second, began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia), led by [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] and his son, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus that they found in the Bible.<ref>McAlister and Tucker (1975). Page 27</ref>\n\n===Stone===\n[[File:stonebw01.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Barton W. Stone]]{{Wikisourcepar|Last Will and Testament of The Springfield Presbytery}}\n{{main|Christians (Stone Movement)}}\nIn 1801, the [[Cane Ridge Revival]] in [[Kentucky]] planted the seed for a movement in Kentucky and the [[Ohio River]] Valley to disassociate from [[denominationalism]]. In 1803 Stone and others withdrew from the Kentucky Presbytery and formed the [[Springfield Presbytery]]. The defining event of the Stone wing of the movement was the publication of the ''Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery'', at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1804. \"The Last Will\" is a brief document in which Stone and five others announced their withdrawal from Presbyterianism and their intention to be solely part of the body of Christ.<ref>Marshall, et al. 1804.</ref> The writers appealed for the unity of all who follow Jesus, suggested the value of congregational self-governance, and lifted the Bible as the source for understanding the will of God. They denounced the divisive use of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].<ref>McAlister and Tucker, (1975) page 79</ref>\n\nSoon, they adopted the name \"Christian\" to identify their group. Thus, the remnants of the Springfield Presbytery became the Christian Church.<ref>McAlister and Tucker, (1975) page 80</ref> It is estimated that the Christian Church numbered about 12,000 by 1830.<ref>McAlister and Tucker, (1975) page 82</ref>\n\n===Campbells===\n[[File:CampbellThomas.png|thumb|100px|right|Thomas Campbell]]\n{{main|Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)}}\nIndependently of Stone, the Campbell wing of the movement was launched when [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] published the ''[[Declaration and address|Declaration and Address]] of the Christian Association of Washington,'' (Pennsylvania) in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In ''The Declaration and Address'' he set forth some of his convictions about the church of [[Jesus Christ]], as he organized the [[Christian Association of Washington]], not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.<ref>McAlister and Tucker, (1975) pages 108-111</ref> On May 4, 1811, however, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it then constructed at Brush Run, it became known as [[Brush Run Church]].<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975) Page 117</ref>\n[[File:Alexander Campbell young.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Young Alexander Campbell]]\nWhen their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed provided that they would be \"allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures.\"<ref>Davis, M. M. (1915), Page 86</ref>\n\nThus began a sojourn for the reformers among the Baptists within the Redstone Baptist Association (1815\u20131824). While the reformers and the Baptists shared the same beliefs in baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that the reformers were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, the differences became intolerable to some of the Baptist leaders, when [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] began publishing a journal, ''The Christian Baptist,'' promoting reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the [[Mahoning Baptist Association]] in 1824.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). page 131</ref>\n\n[[File:Walter Scott (Evangelist).jpg|thumb|100px|right|Walter Scott]]\nIn 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed reformer [[Walter Scott (Clergyman)|Walter Scott]] as an Evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. The elder Campbell realized that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). pages 132 - 133</ref>\n\nSeveral Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the [[Philadelphia Confession]]. The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, the Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. Alexander ceased publication of ''The Christian Baptist''. In January 1831, he began publication of the ''[[Millennial Harbinger]]''.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). pages 144-145</ref>\n\n===Merging===\n[[File:SMITH Raccoon John.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[\"Raccoon\" John Smith (Restoration movement)|\"Raccoon\" John Smith]]]]\n\nThe two groups united at High Street Meeting House, Lexington, Kentucky, with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and [[\"Raccoon\" John Smith (Restoration movement)|\"Raccoon\" John Smith]], on Saturday, December 31, 1831.<ref>Davis, M. M. (1915), Pages 116\u2013120</ref> Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak on behalf of the followers of the Campbells.<ref>Davis, M. M. (1915), Pages 116</ref> While contemporaneous accounts are clear that the handshake took place on Saturday, some historians have changed the date of the merger to Sunday, January 1, 1832.<ref>Garrison & DeGroot (1948) page 212</ref> The 1832 date has become generally accepted. The actual difference is about 20 hours.\n\nTwo representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and \"Raccoon\" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). pages 153\u2013154</ref>\n\n===Naming===\nWith the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name \"Christians.\" Alexander Campbell insisted upon \"Disciples of Christ\". Walter Scott and [[Thomas Campbell (Restoration movement)|Thomas Campbell]] sided with Stone, but the younger Campbell had strong reasons and would not yield. As a result, both names were used. The confusion over names has been present ever since.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975) pages 27-28</ref> Prior to the 1906 separation, congregations would typically be named \"Disciples of Christ,\" \"Christian Church,\" and \"Church of Christ.\" However, there are different practices by each. More than the name separates each church.  For example, the \"Independent Christian Church\" will not accept a woman as a minister while some of the \"Disciples of Christ\" congregations will. These different congregations (Disciples of Christ, Church of Christ, and Independent Church) share many of the same beliefs and practices but there are, in fact, some differences.\n\n===First national convention and missionary movement===\n[[File:Alexander Campbell Age 65.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Alexander Campbell, age 65]]\n\nIn 1849, the first National Convention was held at Cincinnati, Ohio.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot (1948) page 245</ref> Alexander Campbell had concerns that holding conventions would lead the movement into divisive denominationalism. He did not attend the gathering.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot (1948), page 245</ref> Among its actions, the convention elected Alexander Campbell its President and created the [[American Christian Missionary Society]] (ACMS).<ref>Garrison and DeGroot (1948) Page 247</ref>\n\nThe formation of a missionary society set the stage for further \"co-operative\" efforts. By the end of the century, the [[Foreign Christian Missionary Society]] and the Christian Women's Board of Missions were also engaged in missionary activities. Forming the ACMS did not reflect a consensus of the entire movement. Sponsorship of missionary activities became a divisive issue. In the succeeding decades, for some congregations and their leaders, co-operative work through missionary societies and the adoption of instrumental music in church worship was straying too far from their conception of the early church. After the [[American Civil War]], the schism grew. While there was no disagreement over the need for [[evangelism]], many believed that missionary societies were not authorized by scripture and would compromise the autonomy of local congregations.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missionary Societies Controversy\">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8028-3898-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-3898-8}}, 854 pages, entry on ''Missionary Societies, Controversy Over'', pp. 534\u2013537</ref>  This became one important factor leading to the separation of the [[Churches of Christ]] from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missionary Societies Controversy\"/>\n\n===Journals===\nFrom the beginning of the movement, the free exchange of ideas among the people was fostered by the journals published by its leaders. Alexander Campbell published ''The [[Christian Baptist]]'' and ''The [[Millennial Harbinger]]''. [[Barton W. Stone]] published ''The [[Christian Messenger]]''.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), page 208.</ref> In a respectful way, both men routinely published the contributions of others whose positions were radically different from their own.\n\nFollowing Campbell's death in 1866, journals continued to keep the discussion and conversation alive. Between 1870 and 1900, two journals emerged as the most prominent. The ''[[Christian Standard]]'' was edited and published by [[Isaac Errett]] of Cincinnati. ''The Christian Evangelist'' was edited and published by J. H. Garrison from St. Louis. The two men enjoyed a friendly rivalry, and kept the dialog going within the movement.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), page 364.</ref> A third journal became part of the conversation with the publication in 1884 of ''The Christian Oracle'', later to become ''[[The Christian Century]]'', with an interdenominational appeal.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), page 364</ref> In 1914, Garrison's Christian Publishing company was purchased by [[Robert A. Long|R. A. Long]], who then established a non-profit corporation, \"The Christian Board of Publication\" as the Brotherhood publishing house.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), page 426</ref>\n\n===Division===\nIn 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed Churches of Christ for the first time as a group which was separate and distinct from the Disciples of Christ.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). Page 251</ref> However, the division had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). Page 252</ref> The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the Churches of Christ rejecting the use of musical instruments in worship. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860, when some congregations introduced organs, traditionally associated with wealthier, denominational churches. More basic were the underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. The Churches of Christ [[Regulative principle of worship|permitted only those practices]] found in accounts of New Testament worship. They could find no [[New Testament]] documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. The Disciples, by contrast, [[Normative principle of worship|considered permissible any practices]] that the New Testament did not expressly forbid.<ref>McAlister & Tucker (1975). Pages 242 - 247</ref>\n\nAfter the division, Disciples churches used \"Christian Church\" as the dominant designation for congregations. While music and the approach to missionary work were the most visible issues, there were also some deeper ones. The process that led to the separation had begun prior to the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Cartwright, Colbert S. (1987) pages 17 - 18</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1906 separation by the Churches of Christ, additional controversies arose. Should missionary efforts be cooperative or should they be independently sponsored by congregations? Should new methods of Biblical analysis, developed in the late 19th century, be embraced in the study and interpretation of the [[Bible]]?<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), pages 418-420</ref> The \"cooperative\" churches were generally more likely to adopt the new biblical study methods.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, these opposing factions among the Christian Churches coexisted but with growing discomfort and tension. Among the cooperative churches, the three Missionary Societies merged into the United Christian Missionary Society in 1920.<ref>Garrison and DeGroot, (1948), pages 428 & 429</ref> Human service ministries grew through the National Benevolent Association and provided assistance to orphans, the elderly and the disabled.\nBy mid century, the cooperative Christian Churches and the independent Christian Churches were following different paths.\n\n===Restructure===\nFollowing [[World War II]], it became obvious that the organizations that had been developed in previous decades no longer effectively met the needs of the postwar era.<ref>McAlister & Tucker, (1975). page 419</ref> After a number of discussions throughout the 1950s, the 1960 International Convention of Christian Churches adopted a process to \"restructure\" the entire organization.<ref>McAlister & Tucker, (1975). page 421</ref> The Commission on Restructure, chaired by Granville T. Walker, held its first meeting on October 30 & November 1, 1962.<ref>McAlister & Tucker, (1975). pages 436 - 437</ref> In 1968, the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ) adopted the commission's proposed \"Provisional Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).\"<ref>McAlister & Tucker, (1975). pages 442 - 443</ref> Soon the Provisional Design became \"The Design.\"\n\nUnder the design, all churches in the 1968 yearbook of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ) were automatically recognized as part of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In the years that followed, many of the Independent Christian Church Congregations requested formal withdrawal from the yearbook. Many of those congregations became part of the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]].\n\nThe modern disciples have been described as \"a Reformed North American Mainstream Moderate Denomination.\"<ref>Williams (2008)</ref>\n\n{{Restoration Movement Timeline graphical timeline}}\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n\nAs an integral part of worship in most Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregations members celebrate the [[Open Communion|Lord's Supper]]. Most congregations also sing hymns, read from the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture, hear the word of God proclaimed through sermon or other medium and extend an invitation to become Christ's Disciples. As a congregational church, each congregation determines the nature of its worship, study, Christian service, and witness to the world. Through the observance of communion, individuals are invited to acknowledge their faults and sins, to remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, to remember their baptism, and to give thanks for God's redeeming love.<ref>Cartwright (1987) pages 22-23</ref> The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) believes that it is in the local congregations where people come, find, and know God as they gather in Christ's name.<ref>Cartwright (1987) page 30</ref> Because Disciples believe that the invitation to the table comes from Jesus Christ, communion is open to all who confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, regardless of their denominational affiliation.<ref>Cartwright, 1991, page 29</ref>\n[[File:Baptism by immersion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Immersion baptism|Baptism by immersion]]]]For most Disciples, communion is understood as the symbolic presence of Jesus within the gathered community. Most Disciple congregations practice [[believer's baptism]] in the form of [[Immersion baptism|immersion]], believing it to be the form used in the New Testament. The experiences of yielding to Christ in being buried with him in the waters of baptism and rising to a new life, have profound meaning for the church.<ref>Cartwright, (1987) pages 61 - 68</ref>\n<center>\"In essentials, Unity; In non-essentials, Liberty; and in all things, Charity.\"\n<small><br />[[Marco Antonio de Dominis]], ''De Repubblica Ecclesiastica'', adopted as the 19th Century slogan of the Stone-Campbell Movement</small></center>\n\nFor modern Disciples the one essential is the acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and obedience to him in baptism.<ref>Cummins. 1991, Pages 64-65</ref> There is no requirement to give assent to any other statement of belief or creed. Nor is there any \"official\" interpretation of the Bible.<ref>Cummins (1991) pages 14 - 15</ref> Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human-made and divisive, and subsequently, freedom of belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, and the Atonement. Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus there is a tremendous freedom of belief and interpretation. As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways. As would be expected from such an approach, there is a wide diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe. It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as sisters and brothers in Christ.\n\nMembers and seekers are encouraged to take being disciples seriously, meaning that they are student followers of Jesus. Often the best teaching comes in the form, \"I'll tell you what I think, but read the Bible for yourself, and then study and pray about it. Decide in what ways God is calling you to be a follower of Jesus.\"\n\nModern Disciples reject the use of creeds as \"tests of faith,\" that is, as required beliefs, necessary to be accepted as a follower of Jesus. Although Disciples respect the great creeds of the church as informative affirmations of faith, they are never seen as binding. Since the adoption of The Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ),<ref>[http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheDesignoftheChristianChurch/tabid/228/Default.aspx The Design of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201101144/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheDesignoftheChristianChurch/tabid/228/Default.aspx |date=2014-02-01 }}</ref> in 1968, Disciples have celebrated a sense of unity in reading the preamble to the Design publicly. It is as a meaningful affirmation of faith, not binding upon any member. It was originally intended to remind readers that this Church seeks God through Jesus Christ, even when it adopts a design for its business affairs.\n\n<center>\"...the church of Christ upon earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one;<br />consisting of all those in every place that profess their faith in Christ <br />and obedience to him in all things....\"\n\n<small><br />[[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]]&nbsp;\u2014 Proposition 1 of the [[Declaration and address]]</small></center>\n\nThe Disciples celebrate their oneness with all who seek God through Jesus Christ, throughout time and regardless of location. That oneness is symbolized in the open invitation to communion for all who have professed faith in Christ without regard to church affiliation.<ref>Cartwright 1987. Page 13</ref>\n\nIn local communities, congregations share with churches of other denominations in joint worship and in community Christian service. Ecumenical cooperation and collaboration with other Christian Communions has long been practiced, by the Regions.\n\nAt the General Church level, the Council on Christian Unity<ref>[http://www.disciples.org/ccu/ Council on Christian Unity]</ref> coordinates the ecumenical activities of the church. The Disciples continues to relate to the [[National Council of Churches]], of which it was a founding member. It shares in the dialog and in the theological endeavors of the [[World Council of Churches]]. The Disciples has been a full participant in the Consultation on Church Union since it began in the sixties. It continues to support those ongoing conversations which have taken on the title [[Churches Uniting in Christ]]. The goal of these endeavors is not the merger into some \"Super Church\", but rather to discover ways to celebrate and proclaim the unity and oneness that is Christ's gift to his church.\n\n=== Human sexuality ===\nIn 2011, the denomination stated that \"Disciples do not have a formal policy on same-sex marriage.  Different congregations have the autonomy to discern on issues such as this one\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disciples.org/congregations/disciples-congregation-votes-to-change-its-policy-on-marriage/|title=Disciples congregation votes to change its policy on marriage - Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|date=2011-05-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref> In 2013, the Disciples of Christ voted in favor of a resolution affirming all members regardless of sexual orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/blogs/archive/2013-07/welcoming-disciples|title=Welcoming Disciples {{!}} The Christian Century|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref> After same-sex marriage was legalized in the US, the denomination reiterated that it leaves \"all decisions of policy on same-sex marriage to local congregations\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/45162/gay-marriage-mainline-denominations-affirm-scotus|title=Gay marriage: mainline denominations affirm SCOTUS|publisher=Baptist Press|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref>\n\n===Congregations===\nCongregations of the Christian Church are self-governing in the tradition of congregational polity. They select their own leadership, own their own property, and manage their own affairs.\n\nIn Disciples congregations, the priesthood of all believers finds its expression in worship and Christian service. Typically, lay persons who have been elected and ordained as Elders preside with called and installed ordained pastors in the celebration of the sacrament of Holy Communion. The Elders and called Pastors provide spiritual oversight and care for members in partnership with one another.<ref>Cartwright (1987) pages 42 - 44</ref>\n\n===Regional Ministries===\n\nThe Regional Churches of the Christian Church provide resources for leadership development and opportunities for Christian fellowship beyond the local congregation. They have taken responsibility for the nurture and support of those individuals seeking to discern God's call to service as ordained or licensed ministers. Typically, they organize summer camping experiences for children and youth.<ref>[http://www.disciples.org/RegionalMinistries/tabid/56/Default.aspx Regional Ministries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219002859/http://disciples.org/RegionalMinistries/tabid/56/Default.aspx |date=2015-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nRegional churches assist congregations who are seeking ministers and ministers who are seeking congregations. Regional leadership is available on request to assist congregations that face conflict. Though they have no authority to direct the life of any congregation, the Regional Churches are analogous to the [[Middle judicatory|middle judicatories]] of other denominations.\n\n===General Ministries===\n\nThe Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) at the \"General Church\" level consists of a number of self-governing agencies, which focus upon specific Christian witnesses to the world that have emerged in the dialog within the movement since before the first convention in 1849. Typically, these ministries have a scope that is larger than Regional Ministries, and often have a global perspective. The church agencies report to the General Assembly, which meets biennially in odd numbered years. The General Minister and President (GMP) is the designated leader for the General Church, but does not have the administrative authority to direct any of the general church agencies other than \"The Office of General Minister and President.\" The GMP has influence that derives from the respect of the church much as the pastor of a local church leads a local congregation.\n\nThe General Ministries are:<ref>{{cite web |title=General Ministries Directory |url=http://www.disciples.org/GeneralMinistries/GeneralMinistryDirectory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |work=Disciples.org website |accessdate=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115159/http://www.disciples.org/GeneralMinistries/GeneralMinistryDirectory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n* Office of the General Minister and President\n* Christian Board of Publication/Chalice Press\n* Christian Church Foundation\n* Church Extension\n* Council on Christian Unity\n* [[Disciples of Christ Historical Society]]\n* Disciples Home Missions\n* Division of Overseas Ministries/Global Ministries\n* Higher Education and Leadership Ministries\n* National Benevolent Association\n* Pension Fund\n\nOne highly popular and respected General Agency program is the \"Week of Compassion,\" named for the special offering to fund the program when it began in the 1950s.

The chalice represents the centrality of Communion to the life of the church. The cross of [[Saint Andrew]] is a reminder of the ministry of each person and the importance of evangelism, and recalls the denomination's Scottish [[Presbyterian]] ancestry.\n\nAfter the 1968 General Assembly, the Administrative Committee charged a sub-committee with the task of proposing a symbol for the church. Hundreds of designs were submitted, but none seemed right. By November the Deputy General Minister and President, William Howland, suggested that the committee's staff consultant and chairperson agree on a specific proposal and bring it back to the committee: that meant Robert L. Friedly of the Office of Interpretation and Ronald E. Osborn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://disciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/TheStoryoftheChaliceLogo-2015.pdf|title=The Story of the Chalice Logo|last=Disciples of Christ|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, 1970, the two men sat down for lunch. With a red felt-tip pen, Osborn began to scrawl a Saint Andrew's cross circumscribed inside a chalice on his placemat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstchristianwpb.org/the-chalice/|title=The Chalice|website=www.firstchristianwpb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref>\n\nImmediately, Friedly dispatched the crude drawing to Bruce Tilsley, a commercial artist and member of Central Christian Church of Denver, with the plea that he prepare an artistic version of the ideas. Tilsley responded with two or three sketches, from which was selected the now-familiar red chalice. Use of the proposed symbol became so prevalent that there was little debate when official adoption was considered at the 1971 General Assembly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe chalice is a registered trademark of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Congregations and ministries of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) are free to use the chalice in publications, web sites and other media.

Membership peaked in 1958 at just under 2 million.<ref name=\"Arda Profile CC(Doc)\">[http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1071.asp Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): Denominational Profile], [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] website (accessed November 27, 2013)</ref> In 1993, membership dropped below 1 million.

Alexander Campbell taught young leaders and founded [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]].

Three years later, he was appointed a [[Missouri Circuit Courts|circuit court]] judge for the six-county area of the Platte Purchase. In 1843 he was named a [[county commissioner]] in [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte County]], where he then lived.\n\n==Senate career==\nIn October 1843,<ref name=\"house.mo.gov\"/> Atchison was appointed to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to fill the vacancy left by the death of [[Lewis F. Linn]].  He thus became the first senator from western Missouri.<ref name=\"house.mo.gov\"/> At age 36, he was the youngest senator from Missouri up to that time.<ref name=\"house.mo.gov\"/> Later in 1843, Atchison was appointed to serve the remainder of Linn's term and was re-elected in 1849.<ref name=\"house.mo.gov\"/>\n\nAtchison was very popular with his fellow Senate Democrats. When the Democrats took control of the Senate in December 1845, they chose Atchison as President pro tempore,<ref name=\"trivia-library.com\"/> placing him third in succession for the Presidency, and also giving him the duty of presiding over the Senate when the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was absent. He was then only 38 years old and had served in the Senate just two years. In 1849 Atchison stepped down as President pro tempore in favor of [[William R. King]].<ref name=\"trivia-library.com\"/>  King in turn yielded the office back to Atchison in December 1852, since King had been elected Vice President of the United States. Atchison continued as President pro tempore until December 1854.<ref name=\"trivia-library.com\"/>\n\nAs a Senator, Atchison was a fervent advocate of slavery<ref name=\"trivia-library.com\"/> and territorial expansion. He supported the annexation of Texas and the [[U.S.-Mexican War]]. Atchison and Missouri's other Senator, the venerable [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], became rivals and finally enemies, though both were Democrats. Benton declared himself to be against slavery in 1849, and in 1851 Atchison allied with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] to defeat Benton for re-election.\n\nBenton, intending to challenge Atchison in 1854, began to agitate for [[organized territory|territorial organization]] of the area west of Missouri (now the states of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]]) so it could be opened to settlement. To counter this, Atchison proposed that the area be organized ''and'' that the section of the [[Missouri Compromise]] banning slavery there be repealed in favor of [[popular sovereignty]], under which the settlers in each territory would decide themselves whether slavery would be allowed.\n\nAt Atchison's request, [[Stephen A. Douglas|Senator Stephen Douglas]] of [[Illinois]] introduced the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which embodied this idea, in November 1853. The Act became law in May 1854, establishing the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska.\n\n===Border Ruffians===\nBoth Douglas and Atchison had assumed that Nebraska would be settled by [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] men from [[Iowa]] and [[Illinois]], and Kansas by pro-slavery Missourians and other Southerners, thus preserving the numerical balance between free states and slave states. In 1854 Atchison helped found the town of [[Atchison, Kansas]], as a pro-slavery settlement. The town (and county) were named for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/atchison/atchison-co-p2.html|title=History of the State of Kansas by William G. Cutler - 1883 - Reprinted on kancoll.org|publisher=Kancoll.org|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, while Southerners welcomed the opportunity to settle Kansas, very few actually chose to do so. Instead, most free-soilers preferred Kansas. Furthermore, anti-slavery activists throughout the North came to view Kansas as a battleground and formed societies to encourage free-soil settlers to go to Kansas and ensure that both Kansas and Nebraska would become free states.<ref name=Billings>{{cite book |last=Billings |first=R. A. |title=Westward Expansion|year=1949 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York NY |pages=599\u2013601 }}</ref>\n\nIt appeared as if the Kansas Territorial legislature to be elected in March 1855 would be controlled by free-soilers and ban slavery. This was viewed as a breach of faith by Atchison and his supporters. An angry Atchison called on pro-slavery Missourians to uphold slavery by force and \"to kill every God-damned abolitionist in the district\" if necessary.<ref>David M. Potter, Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''The Impending Crisis 1848-1861'' at 203 (Harper, 1976)</ref> He recruited an immense mob of heavily armed Missourians, the infamous \"[[Border Ruffian]]s\". On the election day, March 30, 1855, Atchison led 5,000 Border Ruffians into Kansas. They seized control of all polling places at gunpoint, cast tens of thousands of fraudulent votes for pro-slavery candidates, and elected a pro-slavery legislature.<ref name=Billings/>\n\nThe outrage was nonetheless accepted by the Federal government. When Territorial Governor [[Andrew Reeder]] objected, he was fired by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Pierce|Pierce]].\n\nDespite this show of force, far more free-soilers than pro-slavery settlers migrated to Kansas. There were continual raids and ambushes by both sides in \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\". But in spite of the best efforts of Atchison and the Ruffians, Kansas did reject slavery and finally became a free state in 1861.\n\nCharles Sumner, in the epic \"Crimes Against Kansas\" speech on May 19, 1856, exposed Atchison's role in the invasion, tortures, and killings in Kansas.  Speaking in the flamboyant style he and others used, lacing his prose with references to Roman history, Sumner compared Atchison to Roman Senator [[Catiline]], who betrayed his country [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|in a plot]] to overthrow the existing order.  For two days, Sumner listed crime, after crime, in detail, complete with documentation by newspapers and letters of the time, showing the tortures and violence by Atchison and his men.<ref name=sumner-1856>{{cite web|title=Full text of \"The crime against Kansas. Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts. In the Senate of the United States, May 19, 1856\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/crimeagainstkans00sumn/crimeagainstkans00sumn_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|accessdate=16 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, Atchison gave his own speech, totally unaware as yet that he was exposed on Senate floor in such a fashion. Atchison's speech was to the Texas men he just met, hired and paid for, Atchison reveals in his speech, by \"authorities in Washington\".   They are about to invade Lawrence Kansas.  Atchison makes the men promise to kill and \"draw blood,\" and boasts of his flag, which was red in color for \"Southern Rights\" and the color of blood. They would press \"to blood\"  the spread of slavery into Kansas.   He revealed in this speech that the immediate goal of the invasion was to stop the newspaper in Lawrence from publishing anti-slavery material.  Atchison's men had made it a crime to publish anti-slavery newspapers in Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Copy of David R. Atchison speech to proslavery forces - Kansas Memory|url=http://www.kansasmemory.org/item/90822|website=www.kansasmemory.org|accessdate=16 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAtchison not only makes it clear the men are to kill and draw blood, he tells the men they will be \"well paid\"  and encourages them to plunder from the homes they invade. This was after the hundreds of dozens of tortures and killings Charles Sumner had detailed in his Crimes Against Kansas speech.  In other words, things were about to get much worse, now that Atchison had his hired men from Texas.<ref name=sumner-1856/>\n\n===Defeated for re-election===\nAtchison's Senate term expired on March 3, 1855. He sought election to another term, but the Democrats in the Missouri legislature were split between him and Benton, while the Whig minority put forward their own man. No Senator was elected until January 1857, when [[James S. Green]] was chosen.\n\n===Railroad proposal===\nWhen the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was proposed in the 1850s, Atchison called for it to be built along the central route (from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] through Missouri, Kansas, and [[Utah]]), rather than the southern route (from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] through Texas and [[New Mexico]]). Naturally, his suggested route went through Atchison.\n\n==Civil War General==\nAtchison and A. W. Doniphan would fall out over the politics preceding the Civil War and on which direction Missouri should proceed.  Atchison favored secession, while Doniphan was torn and would remain for the most part non-committal.  Privately Doniphan favored the Union, but found it hard to go against his friends and associates.<ref name=Muench-pp-7-8/>\n\nDuring the secession crisis in Missouri at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Atchison sided with Missouri's pro-Confederate governor, [[Claiborne Jackson]].  He accepted an appointment as a major general in the [[Missouri State Guard]].  Atchison actively recruited State Guardsmen in northern Missouri and served with Missouri State Guard commander General [[Sterling Price]] in the summer campaign of 1861.  In September 1861, Atchison led 3,500 State Guard recruits across the [[Missouri River]] to reinforce Price, and defeated [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops that tried to block his force in the [[Battle of Liberty]].\n\nAtchison continued to serve through the end of 1861.  In March 1862, Union forces in the [[Trans-Mississippi]] theater won a decisive victory at [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]] in [[Arkansas]] and secured Union control of Missouri. Atchison then resigned from the army over reported strategy arguments with Price and moved to Texas for the duration of the Civil War.  After the war he retired to his farm near [[Gower, Missouri|Gower]], and was noted to deny many of his pro-slavery public statements made prior to the Civil War. In addition, his retirement cottage outside of [[Plattsburg, Missouri]] burned to the ground before his death in 1886.  This included the complete loss of his library containing books, documents, and letters which documented his role in the Mormon War, Indian affairs, pro-slavery activities, Civil War activities, and other legislation covering his career as a lawyer, senator, and soldier.\n\n==Purported one-day presidency==\n[[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]\u2014March 4\u2014fell on a Sunday in 1849, and so [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Zachary Taylor]] did not take the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] until the next day. Even so, the term of the outgoing president, [[James K. Polk]], ended at noon on March 4. On March 2, outgoing vice president [[George M.

In the single-slit image, a [[diffraction pattern]] (the faint spots on either side of the main band) forms due to the nonzero width of the slit. A diffraction pattern is also seen in the double-slit image, but at twice the intensity and with the addition of many smaller interference fringes.]]\nIf light consisted strictly of ordinary or [[Classical mechanics|classical]] particles, and these particles were fired in a straight line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side, we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to the size and shape of the slit. However, when this \"single-slit experiment\" is actually performed, the pattern on the screen is a [[diffraction pattern]] in which the light is spread out. The smaller the slit, the greater the angle of spread. The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. [[Diffraction]] explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.\n\n[[File:Double slit experiment.webm|frame|Simulation of a particle wave function: double slit experiment. The white blur represents the particle. The whiter the pixel, the greater the probability of finding a particle in that place if measured.]]\n\nIf one illuminates ''two'' parallel slits, the light from the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more pronounced pattern with a series of alternating light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light.<ref>[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] first proposed the use of this effect as an artifact-independent reference standard for [[length]]\n*C.S.

When [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773\u20131829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness can be explained by the alternately additive and subtractive interference of [[wavefront]]s.<ref name=\"Feynman\" /> Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the [[corpuscular theory of light]] proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the later discovery of the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles.

The [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] is one such model; it states that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary wavelet, and that the disturbance at any subsequent point can be found by [[Superposition principle|summing]] the contributions of the individual wavelets at that point. This summation needs to take into account the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] as well as the [[amplitude]] of the individual wavelets.  It should be noted that only the [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of a light field can be measured\u2014this is proportional to the square of the amplitude.\n\nIn the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by a single laser beam.  If the width of the slits is small enough (less than the wavelength of the laser light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.\n\nIf the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the [[far field]]), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure below right.  The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle {{math|\u03b8}} is given by:\n\n:<math>d \\sin \\theta \\approx d \\theta</math>\n\nWhere d is the distance between the two slits. When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximum, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel and the summed intensity is zero.  This effect is known as [[Interference (optics)|interference]].  The interference fringe maxima occur at angles\n\n:<math>~ d \\theta_n = n \\lambda,~ n=0,1,2,\\ldots</math>\n\nwhere \u03bb is the [[wavelength]] of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes, {{math|\u03b8<sub>''f''</sub>}}, is given by\n\n:<math> \\theta_f \\approx \\lambda / d </math>\n\nThe spacing of the fringes at a distance {{math|''z''}} from the slits is given by\n\n:<math>~w=z \\theta_f = z \\lambda /d</math>\n\nFor example, if two slits are separated by 0.5&nbsp;mm ({{math|''d''}}), and are illuminated with a [[visible spectrum|0.6\u03bcm]] wavelength laser ({{math|\u03bb}}), then at a distance of 1m ({{math|''z''}}), the spacing of the fringes will be 1.2&nbsp;mm.\n\nIf the width of the slits {{math|''b''}} is greater than the wavelength, the [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] equation gives the intensity of the diffracted light as:<ref>Jenkins FA and White HE, Fundamentals of Optics, 1967, McGraw Hill, New York</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI(\\theta)\n&\\propto  \\cos^2 \\left [{\\frac {\\pi d \\sin \\theta}{\\lambda}}\\right]~\\mathrm{sinc}^2 \\left [ \\frac {\\pi b \\sin \\theta}{\\lambda} \\right]\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWhere the [[sinc function]] is defined as sinc(''x'') = sin(''x'')/''x'' for ''x'' \u2260 0, and sinc(0) = 1.\n\nThis is illustrated in the figure above, where the first pattern is the diffraction pattern of a single slit, given by the {{math|sinc}} function in this equation, and the second figure shows the combined intensity of the light diffracted from the two slits, where the {{math|cos}} function represent the fine structure, and the coarser structure represents diffraction by the individual slits as described by the {{math|sinc}} function.\n\nSimilar calculations for the [[near and far field|near field]] can be done using the [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation. As the plane of observation gets closer to the plane in which the slits are located, the diffraction patterns associated with each slit decrease in size, so that the area in which interference occurs is reduced, and may vanish altogether when there is no overlap in the two diffracted patterns.<ref>Longhurst RS, Physical and Geometrical Optics, 1967, 2nd Edition, Longmans</ref>\n\n==Interpretations of the experiment==\nLike the [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the double-slit experiment is often used to highlight the differences and similarities between the various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].\n\n===Copenhagen interpretation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]], put forth by some of the pioneers in the field of quantum mechanics, asserts that it is undesirable to posit anything that goes beyond the mathematical formulae and the kinds of physical apparatus and reactions that enable us to gain some knowledge of what goes on at the atomic scale. One of the mathematical constructs that enables experimenters to predict very accurately certain experimental results is sometimes called a probability wave. In its mathematical form it is analogous to the description of a physical wave, but its \"crests\" and \"troughs\" indicate levels of probability for the occurrence of certain phenomena (e.g., a spark of light at a certain point on a detector screen) that can be observed in the macro world of ordinary human experience.\n\nThe probability \"wave\" can be said to \"pass through space\" because the probability values that one can compute from its mathematical representation are dependent on time. One cannot speak of the location of any particle such as a photon between the time it is emitted and the time it is detected simply because in order to say that something is located somewhere at a certain time one has to detect it. The requirement for the eventual appearance of an interference pattern is that particles be emitted, and that there be a screen with at least two distinct paths for the particle to take from the emitter to the detection screen. Experiments observe nothing whatsoever between the time of emission of the particle and its arrival at the detection screen. If a ray tracing is next made as if a light wave (as understood in classical physics) is wide enough to take both paths, then that ray tracing will accurately predict the appearance of maxima and minima on the detector screen when many particles pass through the apparatus and gradually \"paint\" the expected interference pattern.\n\n===Path-integral formulation===\n[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|200px|One of an infinite number of equally likely paths used in the Feynman path integral (see also: [[Wiener process]])]]\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is similar to the [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics provided by Feynman.  The path integral formulation replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system, with a sum over all possible trajectories.  The trajectories are added together by using [[functional integration]].\n\nEach path is considered equally likely, and thus contributes the same amount.  However, the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of this contribution at any given point along the path is determined by the [[action (physics)|action]] along the path:\n\n::<math>A_{\\text{path}}(x,y,z,t) = e^{i S(x,y,z,t)}</math>\n\nAll these contributions are then added together, and the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the final result is [[Square (algebra)|squared]], to get the probability distribution for the position of a particle:\n\n::<math>p(x,y,z,t) \\propto \\left\\vert \\int_{\\text{all paths}} e^{i S(x,y,z,t)} \\right\\vert ^2 </math>\n\nAs is always the case when calculating [[probability]], the results must then be [[Normalizing constant|normalized]] by imposing:\n\n::<math>\\iiint_{\\text{all space}}p(x,y,z,t)\\,\\mathrm{d}V = 1</math>\n\nTo summarize, the probability distribution of the outcome is the normalized square of the norm of the [[superposition principle|superposition]], over all paths from the point of origin to the final point, of [[wave]]s [[wave propagation|propagating]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionally]] to the action along each path.  The differences in the cumulative action along the different paths (and thus the relative phases of the contributions) produces the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] observed by the double-slit experiment.  Feynman stressed that his formulation is merely a mathematical description, not an attempt to describe a real process that we can measure.\n\n===Relational interpretation===\n[[File:Uncertainty Momentum 1.gif|alt=Uncertainty Momentum|thumb|An example of the uncertainty principle related to the relational interpretation.

In the case of an electron, if it is initially \"observed\" at a particular slit, then the observer\u2013particle (photon\u2013electron) interaction includes information about the electron's position. This partially constrains the particle's eventual location at the screen. If it is \"observed\" (measured with a photon) not at a particular slit but rather at the screen, then there is no \"which path\" information as part of the interaction, so the electron's \"observed\" position on the screen is determined strictly by its probability function. This makes the resulting pattern on the screen the same as if each individual electron had passed through both slits. It has also been suggested that space and distance themselves are relational, and that an electron can appear to be in \"two places at once\"\u2014for example, at both slits\u2014because its spatial relations to particular points on the screen remain identical from both slit locations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Filk|first = Thomas|title = Relational Interpretation of the Wave Function and a Possible Way Around Bell's Theorem|journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume = 45|issue = 6|pages = 1205\u20131219|year = 2006|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v775765467462313/|doi = 10.1007/s10773-006-9125-0|arxiv = quant-ph/0602060 |bibcode = 2006IJTP...45.1166F }}</ref>\n\n===Many-worlds interpretation===\nPhysicist [[David Deutsch]] argues in his book ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'' that the double-slit experiment is evidence for the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. However, since every interpretation of quantum mechanics is empirically indistinguishable, some scientists are skeptical of this claim.\n\n===De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory===\nAn alternative to the standard understanding of quantum mechanics, [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] states that particles have precise locations at all times, and that their velocities are influenced by the wave-function. So while a single particle will travel through one particular slit in the double-slit experiment, the so-called \"pilot wave\" that influences it will travel through both. The two slit de Broglie-Bohm trajectories were first calculated by Chris Dewdney whilst working with Chris Philippidis and Basil Hiley at Birkbeck College (London)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Philippidis|first=C.|last2=Dewdney|first2=C.|last3=Hiley|first3=B.

It ran on an [[Apple II]] computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.<ref name=\"EI\"/><ref name=\"Inventors\">[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm The First Spreadsheet - VisiCalc].

It originated in Europe, where it is the universal standard, replacing earlier cordless phone standards, such as 900&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] [[CT1]] and [[CT2]].<ref name=rohde>{{cite web |url=http://www2.rohde-schwarz.com/en/technologies/Wireless_Connectivity/DECT/information/ |title=DECT Information|website=2.rohde-schwarz.com|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nBeyond Europe, it has been adopted by [[Australia]], and most countries in [[Asia]] and [[South America]]. North American adoption was delayed by [[United States]] radio frequency regulations. This forced development of a variation of DECT, called '''DECT 6.0''', using a slightly different frequency range which makes these units incompatible with systems intended for use in other areas, even from the same manufacturer. DECT has almost universally replaced other standards in most countries where it is used, with the exception of North America.\n\nDECT was originally intended for fast roaming between networked base stations and the first DECT product was [[Net3|Net<sup>3</sup>]] wireless LAN. However, its most popular application is single-cell cordless phones connected to  [[plain old telephone service|traditional analog telephone]], primarily in home and small office systems, though gateways with multi-cell DECT and/or DECT repeaters are also available in many [[Business telephone system#Private branch exchange|private branch exchange]] (PBX) systems for medium and large businesses produced by [[Panasonic]], [[Mitel]], [[Gigaset]], [[Snom]], [[BT Business]], RTX Telecom, and Spectralink. DECT can also be used for purposes other than cordless phones, such as [[baby monitor]]s and industrial sensors. [[DECT Ultra Low Energy|DECT ULE]] is a variant tailored for home security and automation.\n\nThe DECT standard includes the [[generic access profile]] (GAP), a common interoperability profile for simple telephone capabilities, which most manufacturers implement. GAP-conformance enables DECT handsets and bases from different manufacturers to interoperate at the most basic level of functionality, that of making and receiving calls.\n\n''New Generation DECT'' (NG-DECT) standard, marketed as [[CAT-iq]] by the DECT Forum, provides a common set of advanced capabilities for handsets and base stations. CAT-iq allows interchangeability across base stations and handsets from different manufacturers, while maintaining backward-compatibility with GAP equipment. It also requires mandatory support for [[wideband audio]].\n\n==Standards history==\nThe DECT standard was developed by [[ETSI]] in several phases, the first of which took place between 1988 and 1992 when the first round of standards were published. These were the ETS 300-175 series in nine parts defining the air interface, and ETS 300-176 defining how the units should be type approved. A technical report, ETR-178, was also published to explain the standard.<ref name=TR101178>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101178/01.05.01_60/tr_101178v010501p.pdf|title=ETSI TR 101 178 V1.5.1 (2005-02). Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT): A high level guide to the DECT standardization|website=Etsi.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> Subsequent standards were developed and published by ETSI to cover interoperability profiles and standards for testing.\n\nNamed ''Digital European Cordless Telephone'' at its launch by CEPT in November 1987; its name was soon changed to ''Digital European Cordless Telecommunications'', following a suggestion by Enrico Tosato of Italy, to reflect its broader range of application including data services. In 1995, due to its more global usage, the name was changed from ''European'' to ''Enhanced''. DECT is recognized by the [[ITU]] as fulfilling the [[IMT-2000]] requirements and thus qualifies as a [[3G]] system. Within the IMT-2000 group of technologies, DECT is referred to as ''IMT-2000 Frequency Time'' (IMT-FT).\n\nDECT was developed by ETSI but has since been adopted by many countries all over the World. The original DECT frequency band (1880\u20131900&nbsp;MHz) is used in all countries in [[Europe]]. Outside Europe, it is used in most of [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[South America]]. In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 2005 changed channelization and licensing costs in a nearby band (1920\u20131930&nbsp;MHz, or 1.9&nbsp;[[GHz]]), known as [[Unlicensed Personal Communications Services]] (UPCS), allowing DECT devices to be sold in the U.S. with only minimal changes. These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as [[baby monitor]]s and [[wireless network]]s.\n\nThe New Generation DECT ([[#NG-DECT|NG-DECT]]) standard was first published in 2007;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/index.php/news-events/news/199-news-release-10th-may-2007dect|title=DECT reaches a New Generation|website=Etsi.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>  it was developed by ETSI with guidance from the [[Home Gateway Initiative]] through the DECT Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dect.org/magazine/DECT_FLIPBOOK6/DECT_Issue_006_October2016.html#p=10|title=DECT Issue 006 \u2013 October 2016|website=Dect.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> The ETSI TS 102 527 series comes in five parts and covers wideband audio and mandatory interoperability features.

The standard was created to enable home automation, security, healthcare and energy monitoring applications that are battery powered. Like DECT, DECT ULE standard uses the 1.9&nbsp;GHz band, and so suffers less interference than [[Zigbee]], [[Bluetooth]], or [[Wi-Fi]] from microwave ovens, which all operate in the unlicensed 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]. DECT ULE uses a simple star network topology, so many devices in the home are connected to a single control unit.\n\nFuture revisions of the standard (tentatively termed DECT-2020) are expected to include high reliability low-latency DECT ULE for industry machine-to-machine application, high bitrate ultra reliable low latency protocols for professional [[wireless audio]] applications using point-to-point or [[multicast]] communications, high-throughput [[QAM]]-256 modulation; a long term evolution to [[OFDM]] (downlink) and [[OFDMA]]/[[SC-FDMA]] (uplink) modulation with a downlink rate of 1{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (tentatively termed DECT 5G) is being researched by the ETSI DECT committee.<ref>[http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103400_103499/103422/01.01.01_60/tr_103422v010101p.pdf ETSI TR 103 422 V1.1.1 (2017-06): Requirements and technical analysis for the further evolution of DECT and DECT ULE]</ref> The effort aims to adopt the updated DECT protocols into the upcoming [[IMT-2020]] standard, which defines Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), Massive Machine Type Communications (MMTC), and enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) services.<ref>[https://www.dect.org/userfiles/file/Press%20releases/DECT%20Today/DECT%20Today%20May%202018.pdf DECT Today (May 2018)]</ref>\n\nOpenD is an open-source framework designed to provide a complete software implementation of DECT ULE protocols on reference hardware from [[Dialog Semiconductor]] and [[DSP Group]]; the project is maintained by the DECT forum.<ref>http://opend.dect.org</ref><ref>https://stackforce.github.io/opend-doc/</ref>\n\n==Application==\nThe DECT standard originally envisaged three major areas of application:<ref name=TR101178/>\n* Domestic cordless telephony, using a single base station to connect one or more handsets to the public telecommunications network.\n* Enterprise premises cordless PABXs and wireless LANs, using many base stations for coverage. Calls continue as users move between different coverage cells, through a mechanism called handover. Calls can be both within the system and to the public telecommunications network.\n* Public access, using large numbers of base stations to provide high capacity building or urban area coverage as part of a public telecommunications network.\n\nOf these, the domestic application (cordless home telephones) has been extremely successful. The enterprise [[Business telephone system#Private branch exchange|PABX]] market had some success, and all the major PABX vendors have offered DECT access options. The public access application did not succeed, since public cellular networks rapidly out-competed DECT by coupling their ubiquitous coverage with large increases in capacity and continuously falling costs. There has been only one major installation of DECT for public access: in early 1998 [[Telecom Italia]] launched a wide-area DECT network known as \"Fido\" after much regulatory delay, covering major cities in Italy.<ref>[http://www.dectweb.com/DECTForum/news/NewsLettersPDF/nl199801.pdf DECT for Cordless Terminal Mobility].

By using directional antennas and sacrificing some traffic capacity, cell coverage could extend to over {{convert|10|km|mi}}. One example is the [[corDECT]] standard.\n\nThe first data of DECT was [[Net3|Net<sup>3</sup>]] wireless LAN system by Olivetti, launched in 1993 and discontinued in 1995. A precursor to Wi-Fi, Net<sup>3</sup> was a micro-cellular data-only network with fast roaming between base stations and 520 kbit/s transmission rates.\n\nData applications such as electronic cash terminals, traffic lights, and remote door openers<ref name=\"dedected-WhatisDECT\">{{Cite web |url=https://dedected.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/25C3/talk-25c3.pdf |title=What is DECT? |date=29 December 2008 |publisher=deDECTed.org |first=Andreas |last=Schuler |author2=Tews, Erik |author3=Weinmann, Ralf-Philipp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005180737/https://dedected.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/25C3/talk-25c3.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=15 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> also exist, but have been eclipsed by [[Wi-Fi]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] which compete with DECT for both voice and data.\n\n== DECT 6.0 ==\n'''DECT 6.0''' is a North American marketing term for DECT devices manufactured for the United States and Canada operating at 1.9&nbsp;GHz. The \"6.0\" does not equate to a spectrum band; it was decided the term '''DECT 1.9''' might have confused customers who equate larger numbers (such as the '''2.4''' and '''5.8''' in existing 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5.8&nbsp;GHz cordless telephones) with later products. The term  was coined by Rick Krupka of the DECT USA Working Group / Siemens ICM.  \n\nIn North America, DECT suffers from major deficits, especially in comparison to DECT elsewhere, since the [[UPCS band]] (1920\u20131930&nbsp;MHz)  is not free from heavy interference and only half as wide as that used in Europe (1880\u20131900&nbsp;MHz), the 4&nbsp;mW average transmission power limits the range to far less than the 10&nbsp;mW permitted in Europe, and the commonplace lack of GAP compatibility among US vendors binds companies to a single vendor.\n\nBefore 1.9&nbsp;GHz band was approved by the FCC in 2005, DECT could only operate in unlicensed Region 2\n[[2.4 GHz|2.4&nbsp;GHz]] and 900&nbsp;MHz [[ISM band]]s; some users of [[Uniden]] WDECT 2.4&nbsp;GHz phones reported interoperablity issues with [[Wi-Fi]] equipment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/mobilephones/phones/0,239025953,240000290,00.htm |title=WDECT Phone review |access-date=3 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227073209/http://www.cnet.com.au/mobilephones/phones/0,239025953,240000290,00.htm |archive-date=27 February 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/forums.asp?ForumId=9&TopicId=1994 Example of WI-FI and WDECT problems]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2018}}\n\nNorth-American {{nowrap|DECT 6.0}} products may not be used in Europe, Sri Lanka<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daily Mirror|title=TRC Seizes Wireless Phones|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/129915/TRC-seizes-wireless-phones-causing-interruptions-to-mobile-G-network|website=Daily Mirror|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> and Africa, as they cause and suffer from interference with the European, Sri Lankan and South African cellular networks.

It is based on ''New Generation DECT'' (NG-DECT) series of standards from ETSI.\n\nNG-DECT/CAT-iq contains features that expand the generic GAP profile with mandatory support for high quality wideband voice, enhanced security, calling party identification, multiple lines, parallel calls, and similar functions to facilitate [[VoIP]] calls through [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] and [[H.323]] protocols.\n\nThere are several CAT-iq profiles which define supported voice features:\n* '''CAT-iq 1.0''' \u2013 \"HD Voice\" (ETSI TS 102 527-1): wideband audio, calling party line and name identification (CLIP/CNAP)\n* '''CAT-iq 2.0''' \u2013 \"Multi Line\" (ETSI TS 102 527-3): multiple lines, call waiting, call transfer, call intrusion, phonebook, caller list\n* '''CAT-iq 2.1''' \u2013 \"Green\" (ETSI TS 102 527-5): 3-party conference, call intrusion, caller blocking (CLIR), answering machine control, SMS, power-management\n* '''CAT-iq Data''' \u2013 light data services, software upgrade over the air (SUOTA) (ETSI TS 102 527-4)\n* '''CAT-iq IOT''' \u2013 Smart Home connectivity (IOT) with [[DECT Ultra Low Energy]] (ETSI TS 102 939)\n\nCAT-iq allows any DECT handset to communicate with a DECT base from a different vendor, providing full interoperability. CAT-iq 2.0/2.1 feature set is designed to support [[IP-DECT]] base stations found in office [[IP-PBX]] and [[home gateway]]s.\n\n==Technical features==\nThe DECT standard specifies a means for a [[portable phone]] or \"Portable Part\" to access a fixed telephone network via radio. [[Base station]] or \"Fixed Part\" is used to terminate the radio link and provide access to a fixed line. A [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] is then used to connect calls to the fixed network, such as [[public switched telephone network]] (telephone jack), office PBX, ISDN, or VoIP over Ethernet connection.\n\nTypical abilities of a domestic DECT [[Generic access profile|Generic Access Profile]] (GAP) system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same telephone jack. Additional handsets have a battery charger station that does not plug into the telephone system. Handsets can in many cases be used as [[intercom]]s, communicating between each other, and sometimes as [[walkie-talkie]]s, intercommunicating without telephone line connection.\n\nDECT operates in the 1880\u20131900&nbsp;MHz band and defines ten frequency channels from 1881.792&nbsp;MHz to 1897.344&nbsp;MHz with a band gap of 1728&nbsp;kHz.\n\nDECT operates as a multicarrier [[frequency division multiple access]] (FDMA) and [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) system. This means that the [[radio spectrum]] is divided into physical carriers in two dimensions: frequency and time. FDMA access provides up to 10 frequency channels, and TDMA access provides 24 time slots per every frame of 10{{nbsp}}ms. DECT uses [[time division duplex]] (TDD), which means that down- and uplink use the same frequency but different time slots. Thus a base station provides 12 duplex speech channels in each frame, with each time slot occupying any available channel \u2013 thus 10&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;12&nbsp;=&nbsp;120 carriers are available, each carrying 32&nbsp;kbit/s.\n\nDECT also provides [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] over [[time division multiple access|TDMA]]/TDD structure for ISM band applications. If frequency-hopping is avoided, each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each timeslot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and to avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmPT8B-5_tAC&pg=PA587|title=Wireless Communications: Principles And Practice, 2/E|last=S|first=Rappaport Theodore|date=September 2010|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-81-317-3186-4|page=587}}</ref>\n\nDECT allows interference-free wireless operation to around {{convert|100|m|yd}} outdoors, much less indoors when separated by walls.

The most common spectrum allocation is 1880&nbsp;MHz to 1900&nbsp;MHz; outside Europe, 1900&nbsp;MHz to 1920&nbsp;MHz and 1910&nbsp;MHz to 1930&nbsp;MHz spectrum is available in several countries.  \n** {{nowrap|1880\u20131900 MHz}} in Europe, as well as South Africa, Asia, Hong Kong,<ref>{{cite web|title=Beware of Buying Radiocommunications Equipment not Meeting Prescribed Specifications|url=http://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/consumer_focus/education_corner/alerts/radiocomm/beware/index.html|publisher=Office of the Communications Authority}}</ref> Australia, and New Zealand\n** {{nowrap|1786\u20131792 MHz}} in Korea\n** {{nowrap|1880\u20131895 MHz}} in Taiwan\n** {{nowrap|1893\u20131906 MHz}} (J-DECT) in Japan\n** {{nowrap|1900\u20131920 MHz}} in China (until 2003){{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n** {{nowrap|1910\u20131920 MHz}} in Brazil\n** {{nowrap|1910\u20131930 MHz}} in Latin America\n** {{nowrap|1920\u20131930 MHz}} (DECT 6.0) in the United States and Canada\n* Carriers (1.728&nbsp;MHz spacing):\n** 10 channels in Europe and Latin America\n** 8 channels in Taiwan\n** 5 channels in the US, Brazil, Japan\n** 3 channels in Korea\n* Time slots: 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;12 (up and down stream)\n* Channel allocation: dynamic\n* Average transmission power: {{nowrap|10 mW}} (250&nbsp;mW peak) in Europe & Japan, 4&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW peak) in the US\n\n=== Physical layer ===\nThe DECT [[physical layer]] uses FDMA/TDMA access with TDD.\n\n[[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation is used: the binary one is coded with a frequency increase by 288&nbsp;kHz, and the binary zero with frequency decrease of 288&nbsp;kHz. With high quality connections, 2-, 4- or 8-level Differential BPSK modulation (DBPSK, DQPSK or D8PSK), which is similar to QAM-2, QAM-4 and QAM-8, can be used to transmit 1, 2, or 3 bits per each symbol. QAM-16 and QAM-64 modulations with 4 and 8 bits per symbol can be used for user data (B-field) only, with resulting transmission speeds of up to 5,068{{nbsp}}Mbit/s.\n\nDECT provides dynamic channel selection and assignment; the choice of transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the mobile terminal. In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the mobile terminal (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or intercell handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30{{nbsp}}s intervals to generate a received signal strength indication (RSSI) list. When a new channel is required, the mobile terminal (PP) or base station (FP) selects a channel with the minimum interference from the RSSI list.\n\nThe maximum allowed power for portable equipment as well as base stations is 250&nbsp;mW. A portable device radiates an average of about 10&nbsp;mW during a call as it is only using one of 24 time slots to transmit. In Europe, the power limit was expressed as [[effective radiated power]] (ERP), rather than the more commonly used [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP), permitting the use of high-gain directional antennas to produce much higher EIRP and hence long ranges.\n\n===Data link layer===\nThe DECT [[media access control]] layer controls the physical layer and provides [[connection oriented]], [[connectionless]] and [[broadcasting|broadcast]] services to the higher layers.\n\nThe DECT [[data link layer]] uses Link Access Protocol Control (LAPC), a specially designed variant of the [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] data link protocol called LAPD. They are based on [[HDLC]].\n\nGFSK modulation uses a bit rate of 1152 kbit/s, with a frame of 10{{nbsp}}ms (11520{{nbsp}}bits) which contains 24 time slots. Each slots contains 480 bits, some of which are reserved for physical packets and the rest is guard space. Slots 0\u201311 are always used for downlink (FP to PP) and slots 12\u201323 are used for uplink (PP to FP).\n\nThere are several combinations of slots and corresponding types of physical packets with GFSK modulation:\n* Basic packet (P32) \u2013 420 or 424 bits \"full slot\", used for normal speech transmission. User data (B-field) contains 320 bits.\n* Low-capacity packet (P00) \u2013 96 bits at the beginning of the time slot (\"short slot\"). This packet only contains 64-bit header (A-field) used as a dummy bearer to broadcast base station identification when idle.\n* Variable capacity packet (P00''j'') \u2013 100&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' or 104&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' bits, either two half-slots (0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;136) or \"long slot\" (137&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;856). User data (B-field) contains ''j'' bits.\n** P64 (''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;640), P67 (''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;672) \u2013 \"long slot\", used by NG-DECT/CAT-iq wideband voice and data.\n* High-capacity packet (P80) \u2013 900 or 904 bits, \"double slot\". This packet uses two time slots and always begins in an even time slot. The B-field is increased to 800 bits..\n\nThe 420/424 bits of a GFSK basic packet (P32) contain the following fields:\n* 32 bits \u2013 synchronization code (S-field): constant bit string AAAAE98AH for FP transmission, 55551675H for PP transmission\n* 388 bits \u2013 data (D-field), including\n** 64 bits \u2013 header (A-field): control traffic in logical channels C, M, N, P, and Q \n** 320 bits \u2013 user data (B-field): DECT payload, i.e. voice data\n** 4 bits \u2013 error-checking (X-field): CRC of the B-field\n* 4 bits \u2013 collision detection/channel quality (Z-field): optional, contains a copy of the X-field\n\nThe resulting full data rate is 32 kbit/s, available in both directions.\n\n===Network layer===\nThe DECT [[network layer]] always contains the following protocol entities:\n* Call Control (CC)\n* Mobility Management (MM)\n\nOptionally it may also contain others:\n* Call Independent Supplementary Services (CISS)\n* Connection Oriented Message Service (COMS)\n* Connectionless Message Service (CLMS)\n\nAll these communicate through a Link Control Entity (LCE).\n\nThe call control protocol is derived from [[ISDN]] [[DSS1]], which is a [[Q.931]]-derived protocol. Many DECT-specific changes have been made.{{Specify|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe mobility management protocol includes the management of identities, authentication, location updating, on-air subscription and key allocation. It includes many elements similar to the GSM protocol, but also includes elements unique to DECT.\n\nUnlike the GSM protocol, the DECT network specifications do not define cross-linkages between the operation of the entities (for example, Mobility Management and Call Control). The architecture presumes that such linkages will be designed into the interworking unit that connects the DECT access network to whatever mobility-enabled fixed network is involved. By keeping the entities separate, the handset is capable of responding to any combination of entity traffic, and this creates great flexibility in fixed network design without breaking full interoperability.\n\nDECT [[Generic access profile|GAP]] is an interoperability profile for DECT. The intent is that two different products from different manufacturers that both conform not only to the DECT standard, but also to the GAP profile defined within the DECT standard, are able to interoperate for basic calling. The DECT standard includes full testing suites for GAP, and GAP products on the market from different manufacturers are in practice interoperable for the basic functions.\n\n===Security===\nThe DECT media access control layer includes authentication of handsets to the base station using the DECT Standard Authentication Algorithm (DSAA). When registering the handset on the base, both record a shared 128-bit Unique Authentication Key (UAK). The base can request authentication by sending two random numbers to the handset, which calculates the response using the shared 128-bit key. The handset can also request authentication by sending a 64-bit random number to the base, which chooses a second random number, calculates the response using the shared key, and sends it back with the second random number.\n\nThe standard also provides [[encryption]] services with the DECT Standard Cipher (DSC). The encryption is [[Key size|fairly weak]], using a 35-bit [[initialization vector]] and encrypting the voice stream with 64-bit encryption. While most of the DECT standard is publicly available, the part describing the DECT Standard Cipher was only available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] to the phones' manufacturers from [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]].\n\nThe properties of the DECT protocol make it hard to intercept a frame, modify it and send it later again, as DECT frames are based on time-division multiplexing and need to be transmitted at a specific point in time.<ref name=Tews-DECT-World-2016/> Unfortunately very few DECT devices on the market implemented authentication and encryption procedures <ref name=Tews-DECT-World-2016>Dr. DECT Secturity: Present, Past, Future.

With good range (up to {{convert|200|m|ft}} indoors and {{convert|6|km|mi}} using directional antennae outdoors), dedicated spectrum, high interference immunity, open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbit/s, DECT appeared at one time to be a superior alternative to [[Wi-Fi]].<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=CCEJEL&smode=strresults&sort=chron&maxdisp=25&threshold=0&possible1=flatman&possible1zone=article&OUTLOG=NO&viewabs=CCEJEL&key=DISPLAY&docID=1&page=1&chapter=0\n | title = Wireless LANs: developments in technology and standards\n | publisher = IEE Journal of Computing and Control Engineering\n | date = October 1994\n}}</ref> The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space, between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers. The first DECT product to reach the market, Olivetti's [[Net3|Net<sup>3</sup>]], was a wireless LAN, and German firms [[Dosch & Amand]] and [[Hoeft & Wessel]] built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT.\n\nHowever, the timing of the availability of DECT, in the mid-1990s, was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to the more immediately lucrative market for cordless telephones. A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the U.S. market, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECT's time as a technically competitive wireless data transport had passed.\n\n==Health and safety==\n{{See also|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nDECT uses [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radio, similar to mobile phones, baby monitors, Wi-Fi, and other cordless telephone technologies. The UK [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) claims that due to a mobile phone's adaptive power ability, a DECT cordless phone's radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone. A DECT cordless phone's radiation has an average output power of 10&nbsp;mW but is in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250&nbsp;mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web |title=Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317133827077|publisher=(UK) Health Protection Agency |accessdate=10 September 2013 |author=Independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation |date=April 2012}}</ref>\nMost studies have been unable to demonstrate any link to health effects, or have been inconclusive.

Note that this formulation applies equally for compression, where the uncompressed size is that of the original; and for decompression, where the uncompressed size is that of the reproduction. \n\nSometimes the '''space savings''' is given instead, which is defined as the reduction in size relative to the uncompressed size: \n\n:<math>{\\rm Space\\;Savings} = 1 - \\frac{\\rm Compressed\\;Size}{\\rm Uncompressed\\;Size}</math>\n\nThus a representation that compresses a 10MB file to 2MB would yield a space savings of 1 - 2/10 = 0.8, often notated as a percentage, 80%.\n\nFor signals of indefinite size, such as [[streaming audio]] and video, the compression ratio is defined in terms of uncompressed and compressed [[Bit rate|data rates]] instead of data sizes: \n\n:<math> {\\rm Compression\\;Ratio} = \\frac{\\rm Uncompressed\\;Data\\;Rate}{\\rm Compressed\\;Data\\;Rate}</math>\n\nand instead of space savings, one speaks of '''data-rate savings''', which is defined as the data-rate reduction relative to the uncompressed data rate: \n\n:<math>{\\rm Data\\;Rate\\;Savings} = 1 - \\frac{\\rm Compressed\\;Data\\;Rate}{\\rm Uncompressed\\;Data\\;Rate}</math>\n\nFor example, uncompressed songs in CD format have a data rate of 16 bits/channel x 2 channels x 44.1&nbsp;kHz \u2245 1.4 Mbit/s, whereas [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] files on an iPod are typically compressed to 128 kbit/s, yielding a compression ratio of 10.9, for a data-rate savings of 0.91, or 91%. \n\nWhen the uncompressed data rate is known, the compression ratio can be inferred from the compressed data rate.\n\n==Lossless vs. Lossy==\n[[Lossless compression]] of digitized data such as video, digitized film, and audio preserves all the information, but it does not generally achieve compression ratio much better than 2:1 because of the intrinsic [[information entropy|entropy]] of the data.

Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJ]], club DJ who performs  at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablist]] who uses record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the disc in disc jockey referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or [[laptop]]. The title DJ is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s.\n\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when played together or to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\n==Description==\nOriginally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now \"DJ\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or in the 2010s, an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.\n\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to listen to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nThe title \"DJ\" is also commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Q-bert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as \"[[scratching]]\", in which the DJ or [[turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[audio console]]s, professional audio equipment, and, in the 2010s, [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[house music]] or [[hip hop music]]. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Radio DJs===\n{{Main|Radio personality}}\n\nRadio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music that is broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.\n\n===Club DJs===\n\n[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumbnail|right|DJ [[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends - Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]\n[[File:20021101 TRANSPLANT 10 - TALPA live - unedited.webm|thumb|right|200px|A DJ at a techno party in 2002 in Serbia]]\nClub DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A genre of recordings DJ plays defines a genre of such DJ, for example, you can often see terms like Hip Hop DJ, House DJ, Techno DJ etc. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist, or ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings also known as \"reading the crowd\".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don\u2019t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>\n\n===Turntablists===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n\nTurntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]].

Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.\n\n===Turntables===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.\n\n===CDJs===\n{{Main|CDJ}}\nCDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].\n\n===DJ mixers===\n{{Main|DJ mixer}}\n[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]\nDJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.\n\n===Headphones===\n{{Main|Headphones}}\nDJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.\n\nClosed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires \u00bc inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and \u00bc inch jack.

The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.\n\nThe waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as \"keylock\". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].\n\nAs [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.\nDJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.\n\n===Timecode===\nSpecial vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as \"timecode\", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.\n\nThis requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.\n\n===DJ controllers===\n{{Main|DJ controller}}\nDJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.\n\n===Other equipment===\n* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.\n* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.\n* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.\n* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.\n* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)\n*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the \"house mix\" that is playing over the main speakers\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ named \"Grand Wizzard Theodore\" invented the \"DJ scratch\" technique. Other DJs, like Grandmaster Flash, took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.\n\nClub DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor. [[Turntablism]] embodies the art of cutting, [[beat juggling]], [[scratching]], [[Needle drop (DJing)|needle drop]]s, [[phase shifting]], [[back spinning]] and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use [[harmonic mixing]] to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonic mixing: The Basics|url=http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/HowTo.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Mixes Remixes|url=http://www.surroundsounddj.com/dj-mixes-remixes/|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nRecent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \"sync\". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.\n\nIn the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\n\nIn DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.<ref name=\"Fonarow2006\">Wendy Fonarow.

[[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.\n\nIn 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]].

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable.

During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the [[Great Lakes region]]. With expansion of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|auto industry]] in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid [[suburbanization]], Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the [[1950 United States Census|1950 census]], Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 percent.<ref name=CensusCity>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26:2622000 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525104940/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26%3A2622000 |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |df= }}</ref> In 2013, Detroit [[Detroit bankruptcy|became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy]], which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/detroit/detroit-bankruptcy-officially-over-finances-handed-back-to-the-city|title=Detroit bankruptcy officially over, finances handed back to the city |dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/detroit/detroit-bankruptcy-officially-over-finances-handed-back-to-the-city |archive-date=March 4, 2016|work=WXYZ}}</ref>\n\n[[Culture of Detroit|Detroit's diverse culture]] has had both local and international influence, particularly in [[Music of Detroit|music]], with the city giving rise to the genres of [[Motown]] and [[Techno music|techno]], and playing an important role in the development of [[Detroit jazz|jazz]], [[Music of Detroit#hip-hop|hip-hop]], [[Music of Detroit#rock and roll|rock]], and [[Music of Detroit#punk|punk]] music.

The [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (January 18\u201323, 1813) was part of a United States effort to retake the city, and American troops suffered their highest fatalities of any battle in the war.

The area of long-term eruption (the [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]), known as the [[R\u00e9union hotspot]], is suspected of both causing the Deccan Traps eruption and opening the [[rift]] that once separated the [[Mascarene Plateau|Seychelles plateau]] from India. [[Seafloor spreading]] at the boundary between the Indian and [[African Plate]]s subsequently pushed India north over the plume, which now lies under [[R\u00e9union]] island in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of India.  The mantle plume model has, however, been challenged.<ref name=\"mantleplumes\">Sheth, Hetu C. \"[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Deccan.html The Deccan Beyond the Plume Hypothesis].\" ''MantlePlumes.org,'' 2006.</ref>\n\nData continue to emerge which supports the plume model. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion begins at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67\u2009million years ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions.  The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63\u2009million years ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended. This correlation is seen as driven by plume dynamics.<ref name=Cande>S.C. Cande & D.R. Stegman;  Indian and African plate motions driven by the push force of the R\u00e9union plume head; Nature; Volume 475; pp. 47\u201352; (7 July 2011) {{doi|10.1038/nature10174}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian and African plates' motions have also been shown to be coupled, with the common element being the position of these plates relative to the location of the R\u00e9union plume head. The onset of accelerated motion of India coincides with a large slowing of the rate of counterclockwise rotation of Africa. The close correlations between the plate motions suggest that they were both driven by the force of the R\u00e9union plume.<ref name=Cande/>\n\n==Suggested link to impact events==\n\n===Chicxulub crater===\nThere is some evidence to link the Deccan Traps eruption to the asteroid impact which created the [[Chicxulub crater]] in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n.

Policies based on sexual orientation appeared as the United States prepared to enter [[World War II]]. When the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process, it included homosexuality as a disqualifying trait, then seen as a form of [[psychopathology]]. When the army issued revised mobilization regulations in 1942, it distinguished \"homosexual\" recruits from \"normal\" recruits for the first time.<ref>B\u00e9rub\u00e9, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 9\u201314, 19</ref> Before the buildup to the war, gay service members were court-martialed, imprisoned, and dishonorably discharged; but in wartime, commanding officers found it difficult to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and the administrative [[blue discharge]] became the military's standard method for handling gay and lesbian personnel. In 1944, a new policy directive decreed that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].<ref>B\u00e9rub\u00e9, ''Coming Out Under Fire'', 142\u20133</ref>\n\nIn 1947, blue discharges were discontinued and two new classifications were created: \"general\" and \"undesirable\". Under such a system, a serviceman or woman found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would tend to receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were usually dishonorably discharged.<ref>Jones, p. 3</ref> A 1957 U.S. Navy study known as the [[Crittenden Report]] dismissed the charge that homosexuals constitute a security risk, but advocated stringent anti-homosexual policies because \"Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such.\"<ref>Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347</ref> It remained secret until 1976.<ref>E.

Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.\n\nDivination is dismissed by the [[scientific community]] and skeptics as being [[superstition]].<ref>Yau, Julianna. (2002).

However, some would claim that divination is indeed practiced in the Bible, such as in Exodus 28, when the [[Urim and Thummim]] are mentioned. Some would also say that [[Gideon]] also practiced divination, though when he uses a piece of fleece or wool in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:36-40}}, he is not attempting to predict the outcome of an important battle; rather, he is communicating with [[Yahweh|God]]. Communicating with God through prayer may in some cases be considered divination; both are open, typically two-way conversations with God. In addition, the method of \"casting lots\" used in {{bibleref2|Joshua|14:1-5}} and {{bibleref2|Joshua|18:1-10}} to divide the conquered lands of [[Canaan]] between the twelve tribes is not seen by some as divination, but as done at the behest of God (Numbers 26:55).\n\n{{See also|Oracle|Greek divination}}\nBoth oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. [[Oracle#Greece|Oracles]] were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles\u2019 limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (''\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'' in Greek).\n\nSeers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including [[extispicy]], bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.\n\nThe disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.\n\nAt battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the [[campground]] (a process called the ''hiera'') and at the [[battle]]field (called the ''sphagia''). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal\u2019s last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate [[omen]]s.\n\nBecause the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.<ref>Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.''

Many [[Aztec religion|Aztec gods]], including central [[creator deity|creator gods]], were described as diviners and were closely associated with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. [[Tezcatlipoca]] is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].

Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], or the [[Cleromancy|casting of lots]] were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice.

The most common act of divination in the Bao\u2019an village in Taiwan is called the Poe, Bao\u2019an is not the actual name of the village, but for privacy purposes that is what it will be called. The Poe translated to English means \u201cmoon boards\u201d. The Poe consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one\u2019s palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity agrees. \u201cLaughing poe\u201d is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. \u201cNegative poe\u201d is seen when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop, this indicates anger. When there is a positive fall, is called \u201csacred poe\u201d, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a \u201cyes\u201d position three times in a row.\n \nA more serious type of divination is the Ki\u014d-\u00e1. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, during this incense are being burned, and the supernatural agent is asked to descend into the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the god who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted <ref>Rohsenow, Hill Gates, and David K.

Apart from that, a number of other diets were held there.\n\nImportant to [[Protestantism]] (and the Turks){{how|date=September 2017}} were the Diets of 1522 (\"First Diet of Nuremberg\"), 1524 (\"Second Diet of Nuremberg\") and 1532 (\"Third Diet of Nuremberg\").\n\n==The 1522 Diet of Nuremberg==\nThis Diet has become known mostly for the reaction of the papacy to the decision made on [[Martin Luther|Luther]] at the [[Diet of Worms]] the previous year. The new pope, [[Adrian VI]], sent his nuncio [[Francesco Chieregati]] to the Diet, to insist both that the [[Edict of Worms]] be executed, and that action be taken promptly against Luther. This demand, however, was coupled with a promise of thorough reform in the Roman hierarchy, frankly admitting the partial guilt of the Vatican in the decline of the Church.\n\nIn the recess drafted on 9 February 1523, however, the German princes rejected this appeal. Using Adrian's admissions, they declared that they could not have it appear 'as though they wished to oppress evangelical truth and assist unchristian and evil abuses.'\n\n==The 1524 Diet of Nuremberg==\nThis Diet generally took the same line as the previous one. The Estates reiterated their decision from the previous Diet. The Cardinal-legate, Campeggio, who was present, showed his disgust at the behaviour of the Estates. On 18 April, the Estates decided to call 'a general gathering of the German nation', to meet at [[Speyer]] the following year and to decide what would be done until the meeting of the general council of the Church which they demanded.\n\n==References==\n* [[Karl Brandi]], ''The Emperor Charles V'' (1939), pp.&nbsp;185\u2013188\n\n[[Category:Imperial Diets (Holy Roman Empire)|Nuremberg]]\n[[Category:History of Nuremberg]]", "sha1": "simigezuo65gepor7bi2f8e0l0lvpkn"}}, {"title": "Dr. Strangelove", "ns": "0", "id": "8695", "revision": {"id": "866603455", "parentid": "865829511", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T11:14:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cydebot", "id": "1215485"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot - Moving category United States Air Force in films\u200e to [[:Category:Films about the United States Air Force]] per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 October 23]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses of|Strangelove}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Dr. Strangelove\n| image          = Dr. Strangelove poster.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster by [[Tomi Ungerer]]\n| director       = [[Stanley Kubrick]]\n| producer       = Stanley Kubrick\n| screenplay     = {{Plain list|\n* Stanley Kubrick\n* [[Terry Southern]]\n* [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]\n}}\n| based on       = {{Based on|''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]''|Peter George}}\n| starring       = {{Plain list|\n<!--- Poster states \"Peter Sellers, George C.

The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]], stars [[Peter Sellers]] and [[George C. Scott]], and features [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Keenan Wynn]], and [[Slim Pickens]]. Production took place in the [[United Kingdom]]. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958).\n\nThe story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the Soviet Union. It follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a [[nuclear apocalypse]]. It separately follows the crew of one [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber as they try to deliver their payload.\n\nIn 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included ''Dr. Strangelove'' in the first group of films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list.\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the [[Strategic Air Command]] 843rd Bomb Wing, flying [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]]s armed with [[hydrogen bomb]]s. The 843rd Wing is flying on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside the [[USSR]].\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Ripper and Mandrake.png|thumb|left|Ripper tells Mandrake that he discovered the Communist plot to pollute all Americans' \"precious bodily fluids\" during \"the physical act of love.\"]]\n\nGeneral Ripper orders his [[executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake of the UK [[Royal Air Force]], to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong. All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on the [[USSR]] and set their radios to allow communications only through their [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114 discriminator]]s, which was designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and he tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using [[fluoridation]] of the American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes that Ripper has gone insane.\n\nIn the [[Joint War Room|War Room]] at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how Plan R enables a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if [[decapitation strike|all superiors have been killed in a first strike]] on the United States. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in about a couple of hours. Muffley orders the [[U.S. Army]] to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Gen. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, but Muffley refuses to be party to a nuclear [[first strike]]. Instead, he brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room, to telephone [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the \"[[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hot line]]\". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the positions of the [[bomber]]s and targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\n\nAfter a heated discussion in [[Russian (language)|Russian]] with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union has created a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]], which consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with \"cobalt-thorium G\"]] connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the cobalt-thorium G would encircle the earth in a radioactive \"Doomsday shroud\", wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable for about 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or \"untriggered\", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, the former [[Nazi German]] Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.\n\nMeanwhile, [[U.S. Army]] troops arrive at Burpelson, still sealed by Ripper's order, to take over the base after an heated firefight with Air Force security policemen. Gen. Ripper then shoots himself to death, while Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter (\"OPE,\" a variant of both ''Peace on Earth'' and ''Purity of Essence'')<ref name=Kramer>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1844577798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQkoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT53&q=dr%20strangelove%20ope%20recall%20code%20%22peace%20on%20earth%22|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> and relays this code to the Pentagon. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls all of the bombers but one. No one in the War Room knows that a Soviet [[surface-to-air missile]] has damaged the fuel tanks of that plane and destroyed its radio equipment, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code.\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|Bomber commander Major T. J. Kong riding the bomb down.]]\nMuffley discloses the plane's target to help the Soviets find it, but Major Kong, with his fuel dwindling, has selected a nearer target. As the plane approaches the new target, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Maj. Kong enters the [[bomb bay]] and repairs the broken electrical wiring, whereupon the doors open and the [[H-bomb]] is dropped. With Kong straddling it, the bomb falls and detonates over a Soviet [[ICBM]] site.\n\nBack in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep [[mining|underground mine]]s where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided. Turgidson, worried that the Soviets will do the same, warns about a \"mineshaft gap.\" Dr. Strangelove then rises from his wheelchair and announces that he can walk again. Soon, the Doomsday Machine kicks into operation, and the film ends with a montage of many nuclear explosions, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s version of the popular World War II song \"[[We'll Meet Again]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as:\n** [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake, a British [[RAF]] [[exchange officer]]\n** President Merkin Muffley, the [[President of the United States]]\n** Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-using [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] expert and former [[Nazi]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/who_was_dr_strangelove.html|title=Who Was Dr. Strangelove? |date= March 9, 1999|website=Slate (magazine)|access-date=February 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[George C.

Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959).

He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] aircraft commander, but from the beginning, Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy, and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texas accent]]. Kubrick pleaded with him, and he asked the screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southern's tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and he started acting in the scenes in the aircraft, but then Sellers sprained his ankle and he could not work in the cramped cockpit set.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2/><ref>In the fictionalized [[biopic]] ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.</ref>\n\nSellers is said to have [[ad libitum|improvised much of his dialogue]], with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].<ref name=Inside>\"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,\" a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref><!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --> <!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? -->\n\n====Group Captain Lionel Mandrake====\nAccording to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=Inside/><!-- 15m 58s --> There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers's friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and the [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF ace Sir [[Douglas Bader]].\n\n====President Merkin Muffley====\nFor his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed the accent of an American [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]].

However, as he later explained during interviews, he began to see comedy inherent in the idea of [[mutual assured destruction]] as he wrote the first draft. Kubrick said:<blockquote>My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working on the screenplay.

One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by dance scenes in [[Fred Astaire]] films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table.

Fonda was already set&nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set&nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.\"\n\nKubrick argued that ''Fail Safe'''s own source novel ''Fail-Safe'' (1960) had been plagiarized from Peter George's ''Red Alert'', to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and ''Fail Safe'' opened eight months after ''Dr. Strangelove'', to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.\n\n===Ending===\nThe end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming, \"''Mein F\u00fchrer,'' I can walk!\" before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with [[Vera Lynn]] singing \"[[We'll Meet Again]].\" This footage comes from nuclear tests such as shot BAKER of [[Operation Crossroads]] at [[Bikini Atoll]], the [[Trinity test]], a test from [[Operation Sandstone]] and the hydrogen bomb tests from [[Operation Redwing]] and [[Operation Ivy]]. In some shots, old warships (such as the German heavy cruiser ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]''), which were used as targets, are plainly visible. In others, the smoke trails of rockets used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen.\n\nFormer ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]'' writer, and friend of Sellers, [[Spike Milligan]], was credited with suggesting Vera Lynn's song for the ending.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966969835|title=Reconstructing Strangelove : inside Stanley Kubrick's 'nightmare comedy'|last=Mick,|first=Broderick,|isbn=9780231177092|location=New York|oclc=966969835|date=2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\n===Original ending===\n[[File:Pie Fight.jpg|thumb|The cream pie fight was removed from the final cut.]]\nIt was originally planned for the film to end with a scene that depicted everyone in the war room involved in a [[pie fight]].\n\nAccounts vary as to why the pie fight was cut.

Kennedy]]. The film was just weeks from its scheduled premiere, but because of the assassination, the release was delayed until late January 1964, as it was felt that the public was in no mood for such a film any sooner.<ref name=\"George C.

Military strategist and former physicist [[Herman Kahn]] in the book, ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]'' (1960) used the theoretical example of a [[Doomsday device|Doomsday Machine]] to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by [[John von Neumann]]. \nThe concept of such a machine is consistent with MAD doctrine, when it is logically pursued to its conclusion. It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a Doomsday Machine and build one.<ref>See ''On Thermonuclear War'' pp. 144\u2013155</ref> Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower administration]]'s doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and instead he urged America to plan for [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this logical reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the [[flexible response]] doctrine, that while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for responding to a limited nuclear strike, with a proportional or calibrated, return of fire (see ''[[On Escalation]]'').\n\nKahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semirealistic [[cobalt bomb|\"cobalt-thorium G\"]] Doomsday Machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term [[megadeath]]s and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically, but it was unfair, as he was not really advocating nuclear warfare. (He simply meant that if it came to nuclear war, there might, in fact, be a limited one, and options should be kept open.)<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year= 2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=471 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Kahn's cold analytical attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: \"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks.\" Turgidson has a binder that is labelled \"World Targets in Megadeaths\", a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book ''On Thermonuclear War''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/852226548|title=The age of radiance : the epic rise and dramatic fall of the atomic era|last=Craig|first=Nelson|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1451660432|location=|pages=290, 291|oclc=852226548}}</ref>\n\nThe [[wikt:post hoc|post-hoc]] planning in the film, by Dr. Strangelove, done {{em|after}} the MAD policy has clearly broken down, to keep the human race alive and to regenerate from populations sheltered in [[mineshaft]]s, is a parody of those strict adherents of the MAD doctrine who are opposed to the prior creation of [[fallout shelter]]s on ideological grounds. To such adherents, talk of survival takes the \"Assured Destruction\" out of \"Mutual Assured Destruction\", hence no preparations should be conducted for fear of \"destabilizing\" the MAD doctrine. Moreover, it is also somewhat of a parody of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Edward Teller]], Herman Kahn, and [[Chet Holifield]]'s November 1961 popularization of a similar plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of [[radiation shielding|highly protective]] concrete-lined underground fallout shelters, capable of holding millions of people and to be built {{em|before}} any such nuclear exchange began.<ref>''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine November 1961 pages 112\u2013115 et al.</ref> These extensive and therefore wildly expensive preparations were the fullest conceivable implementation of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s, month prior, September 1961 advocacy in favor of the comparatively more modest, individual and community [[fallout shelter]]s, as it appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,<ref>[http://www.em.doe.gov/Publications/timeline_sep1961.aspx DOE.gov]</ref> which was in the context of [[The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)#Context|shelters being on the minds of the public at the time]] due to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]]. The Kennedy administration would later go on to expand the nascent [[United States civil defense]] efforts, including the [[Duck and cover#Delayed nuclear radiation, \"fallout\"|assessment of millions of homes]] and to create a network of thousands of well known, black and yellow plaqued, community fallout shelters. This was done, not with a massive construction effort but by the relatively cheap re-purposing of existing buildings and stocking them with [[CD V-700|CD V-700 geiger counters]] etc. In 1962 the Kennedy administration would found the [[American Civil Defense Association]] to organize this, comparatively far more [[Civil defense#Atomic Age|cost-effective, shelter effort]].\n\nThe fallout-shelter-network proposal, mentioned in the film, with its inherently high [[radiation protection]] characteristics, has similarities and contrasts to that of the very real and robust [[Military of Switzerland#Military and civil defence|Swiss civil defense]] network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304231204576405700994655570 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Deborah | last=Ball | title=Swiss Renew Push for Bomb Shelters | date=June 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm | publisher=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war | date=February 10, 2007}}</ref> If the US did that, it would violate the spirit of MAD and according to MAD adherents, allegedly destabilize the situation because the US could launch a [[first strike]] and its population would largely survive a retaliatory second strike.

Benson of the Department of History of Art at [[Cornell University]] interpreting the film as being sexually-layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, \"Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kong's ride down and detonation at target).\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castle |first1=Alison |title=The Stanley Kubrick Archives |year=2008 |publisher=Taschen |isbn=978-3836508889 |page=359}}</ref>\n\nSexual metaphors often popped up when the nuclear analysts that Kubrick consulted were discussing strategy, such as when [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]] compared his not attacking cities/withhold plan following belligerent escalation to [[coitus interruptus]] in an internally circulated [[memorandum]] at the [[RAND Corporation]] (spoofed in the film as the 'BLAND Corporation'), while he described the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] plan of [[massive retaliation]] as \"going all the way\".

Two ATP molecules are consumed for each phosphodiester bond formed.

The shorter the [[DNA end#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]], the lower the T<sub>m</sub>.\n\nSince blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction. The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur.  The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur.  The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25&nbsp;\u00b0C overnight.  The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.<ref name=\"Tabor_2001\"/>\n\nA novel use of DNA ligase can be seen in the field of nano chemistry, specifically in DNA origami. &nbsp;DNA based self-assembly principles have proven useful for organizing nanoscale objects, such as biomolecules, nanomachines, nanoelectronic and photonic component.

The narrow phylogenetic distribution, unique substrate specificity, and distinctive domain structure of NAD+ depandant compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommend the NAD<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ligases as targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.<ref name=\"Shuman 17365\u201317369\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DNA end]]\n* [[Lagging strand]]\n* [[DNA replication]]\n* [[Okazaki fragment]]\n* [[DNA polymerase]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://nist.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/pdb55_1.html DNA Ligase: PDB molecule of the month]\n*[http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring2003/Weber/ligation.html Davidson College General Information on Ligase]\n*[http://openwetware.org/wiki/DNA_ligation OpenWetWare DNA Ligation Protocol]\n\n{{DNA replication}}\n{{Phosphoric ester and nitrogen-metal ligases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Molecular and Cellular Biology|border=no}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dna Ligase}}\n[[Category:EC 6.5]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:DNA replication]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Enzymes]]", "sha1": "2kkxsrc18qjjzf8xxzr5j8h2l4r5ax6"}}, {"title": "Dewey Decimal Classification", "ns": "0", "id": "8699", "revision": {"id": "865159715", "parentid": "865114718", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T04:06:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Alan W", "id": "38952"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Punct.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect-distinguish|Dewey Decimal|Duodecimal}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2011}}\nThe '''Dewey Decimal Classification''' ('''DDC'''), colloquially the '''Dewey Decimal System''', is a proprietary [[library classification]] system first published in the United States by [[Melvil Dewey]] in 1876.<ref>{{citation | last = Dewey | first = Melvil | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12513/12513-h/12513-h.htm | title = Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library | format = Project Gutenberg eBook | year = 1876 | accessdate = 31 July 2012 }}</ref> Originally described in a four-page pamphlet, it has been expanded to multiple volumes and revised through 23 major editions, the latest printed in 2011.

Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit [[Arabic numerals]] for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects.<ref>Chapter 17 in {{cite book |last1=Joudrey|first1=Daniel N.|last2=Taylor|first2=Arlene G.|last3=Miller|first3=David P.|title=Introduction to Cataloging and Classification|date=2015|publisher=Libraries Unlimited/ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|edition=11th|isbn = 978-1-59884-856-4}}</ref> A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject.

The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.<ref name=\"maichan\">{{Citation |publisher = The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-8108-5944-9 |title = Cataloging and classification |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL9558667M/Cataloging_and_Classification |last = Chan|first=Lois Mai |edition = Third |publication-date = 2007 |page=321|id = 0810859440}}</ref>\n\nNew editions were readied as supplies of previously published editions were exhausted, even though some editions provided little change from the previous, as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand.<ref>Comaromi (1976), p. 218.</ref> In the next decade, three editions followed closely on: the 3rd (1888), 4th (1891), and 5th (1894).

By popular request, in 1930, the [[Library of Congress]] began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards, thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nDewey's was not the only library classification available, although it was the most complete. [[Charles Ammi Cutter]] published the [[Cutter Expansive Classification|Expansive Classification]] in 1882, with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey. Cutter's system was not adopted by many libraries, with one major exception: it was used as the basis for the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system.<ref name=forbes-cutter>{{cite web|title=Cutter Classification|url=http://www.forbeslibrary.org/research/index.php?n=Main.CutterClassification|work=Forbes Library Subject Guides|publisher=Forbes Library|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, located in Belgium and led by [[Paul Otlet]], contacted Dewey about the possibility of translating the classification into French, and using the classification system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission for the creation of a version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French ''Classification Decimal''.

Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions: the library edition, which would be the fullest edition; the bibliographic edition, in English and French, which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf; and the abridged edition.<ref>Comaromi (1976), p. 381</ref> In 1933, the bibliographic edition became the [[Universal Decimal Classification]], which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions.

Main divisions include philosophy, social sciences, science, technology, and history. The scheme is made up of [[List of Dewey Decimal classes|ten classes]], each divided into ten divisions, each having ten sections. The system's notation uses Arabic numbers, with three whole numbers making up the main classes and sub-classes and decimals creating further divisions. The classification structure is [[hierarchical]] and the notation follows the same hierarchy. Libraries not needing the full level of detail of the classification can trim right-most decimal digits from the class number to obtain a more general classification.<ref>Chan (2007), pp.&nbsp;326\u2013331</ref> For example:\n\n:500 Natural sciences and mathematics\n:: 510 Mathematics\n::: 516 Geometry\n:::: 516.3 Analytic geometries\n::::: 516.37 Metric differential geometries\n:::::: 516.375 Finsler geometry\n\nThe classification was originally enumerative, meaning that it listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a [[faceted classification]] scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics +&nbsp;.9 for geographic treatment +&nbsp;.04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States +&nbsp;.05 for [[periodical]] publications on the topic to arrive at the number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy).

According to Winthrop Sargeant,{{quote|The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. ''Su'' and ''dus'' are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word ''kha'', in later Sanskrit meaning \"sky,\" \"ether,\" or \"space,\" was originally the word for \"hole,\" particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan's vehicles. Thus ''sukha'' \u2026 meant, originally, \"having a good axle hole,\" while ''duhkha'' meant \"having a poor axle hole,\" leading to discomfort.{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=303}}}}\n\n[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], American [[vipassana]] teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:\n{{quote|The word ''dukkha'' is made up of the prefix ''du'' and the root ''kha''.

Northcutt refused to do so, saying, \"It was a community! I could not do that. Even though it might have cost me a lot of money, I kept saying no.\" She eventually found a publisher who agreed to print a book containing only 10% of the material gathered for the website.

One such person wrote, \"This is horrible. It has shocked our community to the core. You should remove this.\" But Northcutt said \"I can't. It's just too stupid.\" Northcutt kept the stories on the website and in her books, citing them as a \"funny-but-true safety guide\", and mentioning that children who read the book are going to be much more careful around explosives.<ref name=\"CNN_interview\">{{cite news|title='Darwin Awards' author dedicated to documenting macabre mishaps. |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119105342/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-03/entertainment/darwin.awards_1_deaths-darwin-award-wendy-northcutt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=January 3, 2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe website also recognizes, with Honorable Mentions, individuals who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact.

After much discussion,  a small category regarding deaths below this age limit also exists. Entry into this category requires that the peers of the candidate be of the opinion that the actions of the person in question were above and beyond the limits of reason.\n\nHowever, in 2011, the awards targeted a 16-year-old boy in Leeds who died stealing copper wiring (the standard minimum driving age in Great Britain being 17). In 2012, Northcutt made similar light of a 14-year-old girl in Brazil who was killed while leaning out of a school bus window; however, she was \"disqualified\" for the award itself because of the likely public objection due to the girl's age, which Northcutt asserts is based on \"[[magical thinking]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homoeconomicusnet.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/darwin-awards-2012-too-young-to-include/|title=Darwin Awards 2012 \u2013 too young to include?|date=10 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Veracity ===\n;Event must be verified\nThe story must be documented by reliable sources: e.g., reputable newspaper articles, confirmed television reports, or responsible eyewitnesses.  If a story is found to be untrue, it is disqualified, but particularly amusing ones are placed in the [[urban legend]] section of the archives.  Despite this requirement, many of the stories are fictional, often appearing as \"original submissions\" and presenting no further sources than unverified (and unreliable) \"eyewitnesses\". Most such stories on Northcutt's Darwin Awards site are filed in the Personal Accounts section.\n\nIn addition, later revisions to the qualification criteria add several requirements that have not been made into formalized 'rules': innocent bystanders cannot be in danger, and the qualifying event 'must' be caused without deliberate intent (to prevent glory-seekers from purposely injuring themselves solely to win a Darwin).\n\n== Books ==\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards: Evolution in Action |year =  2000 |publisher = Plume |location = New York City |isbn = 978-0-525-94572-7}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards II: Unnatural Selection |year =  2001 |publisher = Plume  |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1-101-21896-9}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards 3: Survival of the Fittest |year =  2003 |publisher = Plume  |location = New York City |isbn = 978-0-525-94773-8}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards: The Descent of Man |year =  2005 |publisher = Running Press Miniature Editions |isbn = 978-0-7624-2561-7}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards: Felonious Failures |year =  2005 |publisher = Running Press Miniature Editions |isbn = 978-0-7624-2562-4}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards 4: Intelligent Design |year =  2006 |publisher = Dutton |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1-101-21892-1}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards V: Next Evolution |year =  2008 |publisher = Dutton  |location = New York City |isbn = 978-0-14-301033-3}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards Next Evolution: Chlorinating the Gene Pool |year =  2008 |publisher = Dutton  |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1-4406-3677-6}}\n* {{cite book |last = Northcutt |first = Wendy |title = The Darwin Awards: Countdown to Extinction |year =  2010 |publisher = Dutton  |location = New York City |isbn = 978-1-101-44465-8}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accident-proneness]]\n* [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions]]\n* [[List of preventable causes of death]]\n* [[List of selfie-related injuries and deaths]]\n* [[List of unusual deaths]]\n* [[Just-world hypothesis]]\n* [[Schadenfreude]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikinews|2007 Darwin Award winners announced}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.darwinawards.com/}}\n\n{{Darwin|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Comedy websites]]\n[[Category:Ironic and humorous awards]]\n[[Category:Incompetence]]\n[[Category:Black comedy]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Awards established in 1993]]\n[[Category:1993 establishments in the United States]]", "sha1": "hq7bzpb07wbnicusuwkzus5dgbnbqb5"}}, {"title": "Outline of dance", "ns": "0", "id": "8704", "revision": {"id": "866400464", "parentid": "866396082", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T02:45:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/2401:4900:1806:4DA9:1:2:802:DD31|2401:4900:1806:4DA9:1:2:802:DD31]] ([[User talk:2401:4900:1806:4DA9:1:2:802:DD31|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{See also|Index of dance articles}}\n<!--...

[[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. A great many dances and dance styles are performed to [[dance music]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==What ''type'' of thing is dance?==\nDance (also called \"dancing\") can be described as all of the following:\n\n* an activity or [[Human behavior|behavior]]\n** one of [[the arts]] &ndash; a creative endeavor or discipline.\n*** one of the [[performing arts]] &ndash; art performed for an audience and existing in time rather than as a permanent object.\n** [[Hobby]] &ndash; regular activity or interest that is undertaken for pleasure, typically done during one's leisure time.\n** [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] &ndash; bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.\n** [[Recreation]] &ndash; leisure time activity\n* [[motion (physics)|Motion]] &ndash; change in position over time.\n\n== Types of dance ==\n\nType of dance &ndash; a particular dance or dance style.  There are many varieties of dance.  Dance categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[tango (dance)|tango]] is traditionally a ''partner dance''. While it is mostly ''social dance'', its [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] form may be ''competitive dance'', as in [[DanceSport]]. At the same time it is enjoyed as ''performance dance'', whereby it may well be a ''solo dance''.\n* [[List of dances]]\n** [[List of dance style categories]]\n** [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances by origin]]\n** [[List of folk dances sorted by origin]]\n** [[List of national dances]]\n** [[List of DanceSport dances]]\n\n=== Dance genres ===\n\n* [[Acro dance]]\n* [[Breakdancing|B-boying]]\n* [[Ballet]]\n** [[Glossary of ballet terms]]\n* [[Bollywood dance]]\n* [[Ballroom dance]]\n* [[Baroque dance]]\n* [[Belly dance]]\n** [[Glossary of belly dance terms]]\n*[[Bharatanatyam]]\n*[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha-cha]]\n* [[Chicago stepping]]\n* [[Circle dance]]\n* [[Contemporary dance]]\n* [[Country-western dance]]\n* [[Disco]]\n** [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]\n* [[Erotic dancing]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* [[Flamenco]]\n* [[Folk dance]]\n* [[Hip-hop dance]]\n* [[Indian classical dance]]\n* [[Jazz dance]]\n* [[Jig]]\n* [[Jive (dance)|Jive]]\n* [[Krumping]]\n* [[Lambada]]\n* [[Lap dance]]\n* [[Limbo (dance)|Limbo]]\n* [[Line dance]]\n* [[Mambo (dance)|Mambo]]\n* [[Modern dance]]\n* [[Pole dance]]\n* [[Polka]]\n* [[Quickstep]]\n* [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]]\n* [[Sequence dance]]\n* [[Street dance]]\n* [[Swing (dance)|Swing]]\n* [[Tango]]\n* [[Tap dance]]\n* [[Twist (dance)|Twist]]\n* [[Two-step (dance move)|Two-step]]\n* [[Waltz]]\n* [[War dance]]\n* [[Zamba (artform)|Zamba]]\n* '''[[List of dances|more...]]'''\n\n=== Dance styles by number of interacting dancers ===\n* [[Solo dance]] &ndash; a dance danced by an individual dancing alone.\n* [[Partner dance]] &ndash; dance with just 2 dancers, dancing together. In most partner dances, one, typically a man, is the leader; the other, typically a woman, is the follower. As a rule, they maintain connection with each other. In some dances the connection is loose and called dance handhold. In other dances the connection involves body contact.\n** [[Glossary of partner dance terms]]\n* [[Group dance]] &ndash; dance danced by a group of people simultaneously. Group dances are generally, but not always, coordinated or standardized in such a way that all the individuals in the group are dancing the same steps at the same time.

The last German-built DKW car was the [[DKW F102|F102]], which ceased production in 1966. Its successor, the [[four-stroke]] [[Audi F103|F103]], was marketed under the Audi brand, another Auto Union marque.\n\nDKW-badged cars continued to be built under license in Brazil and Argentina until 1967 and 1969 respectively.  The DKW trademark is currently owned by Auto Union GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Audi AG which also owns the rights to other historical trademarks and intellectual property of the Auto Union combine.\n\n==Automobiles made between 1928 and 1942==\n[[File:MHV DKW F1 1931 01.jpg|thumb|1931 DKW F1]]\nDKW cars were made from 1928 until 1966, apart from an interruption caused by the Second World War. DKWs always used [[two-stroke engine]]s, reflecting the company's position by the end of the 1920s as the world's largest producer of motorcycles. The first DKW car, the small and rather crude [[DKW Typ P|Typ P]], emerged on 7 May 1928<ref name=\"Oswald, p 86\">[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 86</ref> and the model continued to be built at the company's [[Spandau]] (Berlin) plant, first as a roadster and later as a stylish if basic sports car, until 1931.\n\nMore significant was a series of inexpensive cars built 300&nbsp;km (185 miles) to the south in Zwickau in the plant acquired by [[J\u00f8rgen Skafte Rasmussen|the company's owner]] in 1928 when he had become the majority owner in [[Audi|Audi Werke AG]].<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 85</ref> Models [[DKW F1|F1]] to [[DKW F8|F8]] (F for Front) were built between 1931 and 1942, with successor models reappearing after the end of the [[Second World War|war]] in 1945. They were the first volume production cars in Europe with [[front wheel drive]], and were powered by [[transversely mounted engine|transversely mounted]] two-cylinder two-stroke engines. Displacement was 584 or 692&nbsp;cc: claimed maximum power was initially 15 PS, and from 1931 a choice between 18 or {{convert|20|hp|abbr=on}}. These models had a generator that doubled as a starter, mounted directly on the [[crankshaft]], known as a [[Dynastart]].<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 94 - 103</ref> DKWs from Zwickau notched up approximately 218,000 units between 1931 and 1942.<ref name=\"Oswald, p 86\"/> Most cars were sold on the home market and over 85% of DKWs produced in the 1930s were the little F series cars: DKW reached second place in German sales by 1934 and stayed there, accounting for 189,369 of the cars sold between 1931 and 1938, more than 16% of the market.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 531</ref>\n\nBetween 1929 and 1940, DKW produced a less well remembered but technically intriguing series of rear-wheel drive cars called (among other names) [[DKW Typ 4=8|''Schwebeklasse'' and ''Sonderklasse'']] with two-stroke [[V4 engine|V4]] engines.<ref>[[#Oswald|Oswald]], p 87</ref> [[Engine displacement]] was 1,000&nbsp;cc, later 1,100&nbsp;cc. The engines had two extra cylinders for [[forced induction]], so they appeared like [[V6 engine]]s but without [[spark plug]]s on the front cylinder pair.\n\nIn 1939, DKW made a [[prototype]] with the first [[straight-three engine|three-cylinder engine]], with a displacement of 900&nbsp;cc and producing {{convert|30|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. With a streamlined body, the car could run at {{convert|115|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It was put into production after [[World War II]], first as an [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau]] (IFA) F9 (later [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]]) in [[Zwickau]], [[East Germany]], and shortly afterwards in DKW-form from D\u00fcsseldorf as the 3=6 or F91.\n\nDKW engines were used by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] as a model for the [[Saab two-stroke]] in its [[Saab 92]] car manufacturing venture, in 1947.\n\n==Automobiles made after 1945==\n[[File:Osmo Kalpala - 1956 Rally Finland.jpeg|thumb|Osmo Kalpala servicing his DKW during the 1956 [[Rally Finland]].]]\n\nAs Auto Union was based in Saxony in what became the [[German Democratic Republic]], it took some time for it to regroup after the war. The company was registered in West Germany as Auto Union GmbH in 1949, first as a spare-part provider, but soon to take up production of the RT 125 motorcycle and a new [[delivery van]], called a ''[[DKW Schnellaster|Schnellaster]]'' F800. Their first line of production took place in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. This van used the same engine as the last F8 made before the war.\n\nTheir first car was the F89 using the body from the prototype F9 made before the war and the two-cylinder [[two-stroke engine]] from the last F8. Production went on until it was replaced by the successful three-cylinder engine that came with the F91. The F91 was in production 1953\u20131955, and was replaced by the larger F93 in 1956. The F91 and F93 had 900&nbsp;cc three-cylinder two-stroke engines, the first ones delivering {{convert|34|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the last {{convert|38|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The ignition system comprised three independent sets of [[Circuit breaker|points]] and [[Ignition coil|coils]], one for each cylinder, with the points mounted in a cluster around a single [[wikt:lobe|lobed]] [[cam]] at the front end of the crankshaft. The cooling system was of the [[convection|free convection]] type assisted by a fan driven from a pulley mounted at the front end of the crankshaft.\n\nThe F93 was produced until 1959, and was replaced by the Auto-Union 1000. These models where produced with a 1,000&nbsp;cc two-stroke engine, with a choice between {{convert|44|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|50|hp|kW|abbr=on}} S versions until 1963. During this transition, production was moved from D\u00fcsseldorf to [[Ingolstadt]], where Audi still has its production. From 1957, the cars could be fitted with a [[saxomat]], an automatic clutch, the only small car then offering this feature. The last versions of the Auto-Union 1000S had [[disc brakes]] as option, an early development for this technology. A sporting 2+2 seater version was available as the Auto-Union 1000 SP from 1957 to 1964, the first years only as a [[coup\u00e9]] and from 1962 also as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]].\n\nIn 1956, the very rare [[DKW Monza]] was put into small-scale production on a private initiative, with a sporting two-seater body of [[glassfiber]] on a standard F93 frame. It was first called Solitude, but got its final name from the long-distance speed records it made on the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza]] in Italy in November 1956. Running in [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) class G, it set records including 48 hours at an average speed of {{convert|140.961|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, 10,000&nbsp;km at {{convert|139.453|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and 72 hours at {{convert|139.459|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The car was first produced by [[:de:Dannenhauer & Strauss]]  in [[Stuttgart]], then by Massholder in [[Heidelberg]] and lastly by Robert Schenk in Stuttgart. The number produced is said to be around 230 and production finished by the end of 1958.\n[[File:DKW Junior DeLuxe 1962.JPG|thumb|right|DKW Junior (1962)]]\n\nA more successful range of cars was sold from 1959, the Junior/F12 series based on a modern concept from the late 1950s. The range consists of Junior (basic model) made from 1959 to 1961, Junior de Luxe (a little enhanced) from 1961 to 1963, F11 (a little larger) and F12 (larger and bigger engine) from 1963 to 1965, and F12 Roadster from 1964 to 1965. The Junior/F12 series became quite popular, and many cars were produced. An assembly plant was licensed in Ballincollig, co.cork, Ireland between 1952 and c.1964 and roughly 4,000 vehicles were assembled, ranging from saloons, vans and motorbikes to commercial [[combine harvester]]s. This was the only DKW factory outside Germany in Europe and for many years after its closure its large DKW sign could be visible on the wall of the factory.  The building was demolished in the late 2000s and was redeveloped into the German Aldi store and a McDonalds drive-thru. \n\nAll the three-cylinder two-stroke post-war cars had some sporting potential and formed the basis for many [[rallying|rally]] victories in the 1950s and early 1960s. This made DKW the most winning car brand in the European rally league for several years during the fifties.\n\nIn 1960, DKW developed a [[V6 engine]] by combining two three-cylinder two-stroke engines, with a capacity of 1,000&nbsp;cc. The capacity was increased and the final V6 in 1966 had a capacity of 1,300&nbsp;cc, which developed {{convert|83|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm using the standard configuration with two [[carburettor]]s. A four-carburettor version produced {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, a six-carburettor one {{convert|130|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. It weighed only {{convert|84|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The V6 was planned to be used in the [[DKW Munga]] and the F102. About 100 engines were built for testing purposes and 13 DKW F102 and some Mungas were fitted with the V6 engine in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dyna.co.za/cars/specs.htm |title=DKW Specifications |publisher=Dyna.co.za |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605035112/http://www.dyna.co.za/cars/specs.htm |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe last DKW was the [[DKW F102|F102]], coming into production in 1964 as a replacement for the old-looking AU1000. However, the F102 sold poorly - largely due to its two-stroke engine technology which was at the limit of its development, resulting in Auto Union's parent - [[Daimler-Benz]], to offload the company to [[Volkswagen]].  The car was re-engineered with a [[four-stroke engine]] and relaunched under the resurrected [[Audi]] brand as the [[Audi F103|F103]]. The transition to four-stroke engines marked the end of the DKW marque for cars, and the rebirth of the Audi name.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1961, Dutch importer [[Hart, Nibbrig & Greve]] assembled cars in an abandoned asphalt factory in [[Sassenheim]], where they employed about 120 workers, two transporter, that collected SKD kits from Duesseldorf and build about 13.500 cars. When the DKW plant moved the import of SKD kits stopped, as it became too expensive.<ref>Autokampioen 25/26 2007 \"Made in Holland\" by Yop Segers</ref>\n\n==DKW in South America==\nFrom 1956 to 1967, DKW cars were made in Brazil by the local company Vemag (''Ve\u00edculos e M\u00e1quinas Agr\u00edcolas S.A.'', \"Vehicles and Agricultural Machinery Inc.\").<ref>{{cite journal|year=1973|journal=Automobile Quarterly|publisher=Automobile Quarterly|volume=11|issue=4|title=Vemag|quote=the Vemag company that had been manufacturing two-stroke DKW models under license in Brazil.}}</ref> Vemag was assembling [[Scania-Vabis]] trucks, but Scania Vabis became an independent company in July 1960.<ref name=shapiro>{{cite journal | title = Determinants of Firm Entry into the Brazilian Automobile Manufacturing Industry, 1956-1968 | ref = HShap | first = Helen | last = Shapiro | volume = 65 | journal = The Business History Review | number = 4, The Automobile Industry |date=Winter 1991 | page = 897 }}</ref> The original plans were to build the Candango off-roader (Munga), a utility vehicle and a four-door sedan, called Vemaguet and Belcar respectively. The first model built was the 900&nbsp;cc F91 Universal but the Belcar and Vemaguet names were applied later.\n[[File:1967 DKW-Vemag Belcar.jpg|thumb|A second series 1967 DKW-Vemag Belcar in front of a first series 1964 DKW-Vemag Belcar]]\n\nIn 1958, the F94 four-door sedan and station wagon were launched, in the early 1960s renamed Belcar and Vemaguet. The company also produced a luxury coupe (the DKW Fissore) and the off-road [[DKW Munga|Munga]] (locally called Candango). In 1960 Vemag cars received the larger one-litre, {{convert|50|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine from the [[Auto Union 1000]].<ref name=VoGo>{{cite web|url=http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr.html |title=DKWs in Brazil |last1=Vogel |first1=Jason |last2=Gomes |first2=Flavio |publisher=KTUD Online Automotive Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515084413/http://www.team.net/www/ktud/saspeci/dkwbr.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVemag had a successful official racing team, with the coupe GT Malzoni, with fiberglass body. This project was the foundation of the long-lasting Brazilian sports car brand [[Puma (car manufacturer)|Puma]]. The Brazilian F94 line has been improved with several cosmetic changes and became more and more different from the German and Argentine models. Vemag had no capital to invest in new products and came under governmental pressure to merge. In 1964-1965 Volkswagen gradually took over [[Auto Union]], a minority holder in Vemag, and in 1967 Volkswagen bought the remainder of the stock.<ref>[[#HShap|Shapiro]], p. 935</ref> VW quickly began phasing out DKW-Vemag production and introduced the [[Volkswagen Type 3#Coffin|Volkswagen 1600]] sedan to the old Vemag plant, after a total of 109,343 DKW-Vemag cars had been built.<ref name=VoGo/><ref name=\"Maravilha\">{{citation | title = DKW - A grande hist\u00f3ria da Pequena Maravilha |trans-title=DKW: The great history of the little wonder | language = Portuguese | first1 = Paulo C\u00e9sar | last1 = Sandler | first2 = Rog\u00e9rio | last2 = de Simone | publisher = Editora Ala\u00fade | isbn = 978-85-7881-037-5 | location = S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil }}</ref>\n\nDKW vehicles were made in [[Argentina]] from 1960 to 1969 by IASF S.A.

As war reparations, the design drawings of the RT125 were given to [[Harley-Davidson]] in the US and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] in the UK.

IFA and later [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]] models continued in production until the 1990s, when economics brought production of the two stroke to an end.

While sailing from Spain to America in pursuit, his ship was captured by the pirate ship ''The Sulphur Pit'', commanded by Captain Satan. In a one-on-one fight, Syn defeated and killed Captain Satan to take command of his ship and crew; among them was Mr. Mipps, a former [[Royal Navy]] carpenter with whom Syn had become friends in England after rescuing him from the Customs men. Mipps swore loyalty to Syn from that time onward.\n\nWith Mipps at his side, Syn turned to piracy and became a great success. Later, when his crew refused to let Syn leave, Syn and Mipps slipped away in one of the ship's boats; unknown to Syn, Mipps had arranged a convenient \"accident\" in the ship's powder magazine with an exploding barrel of gunpowder, eliminating witnesses of Syn's piratical acts.\n\nMipps then joined Syn in his quest for revenge, pursuing Tappitt and Imogene throughout the thirteen American colonies (supposedly preaching the gospel to the Indians) and around the world (as part of a whaling voyage) afterwards. Mipps was with him in the [[Caribbean]] when Dr. Syn turned again to piracy, assuming the name of Captain Clegg (taking the name \"Clegg\" from a certain vicious biting fly he had encountered in America)., \"Clegg\" hijacked his enemy Tappitt's own ship and crew and sailed off with them (renaming the ship the ''Imogene'') to become the most infamous pirate of the day.\n\nHowever, a [[mulatto]] who escaped the destruction of Syn's previous ship stowed away in Clegg's ship and accused him before the crew; Clegg quelled the potential [[mutiny]] by having the mulatto's tongue cut out, marooning him on a [[coral reef]] and violently killing Yellow Pete, the ship's Chinese cook, who represented the crew in their wish to rescue the mulatto. Afterwards, realizing that Clegg had become too notorious, Syn decided to abandon his quest and return to England, and Mipps set up a second \"accidental\" explosion to destroy the ''Imogene'' and her crew.<ref name=\"High Seas\" />\n\nSyn returned to England on the night of a storm (13 November 1775<ref name=Scarecrow>{{cite book|last=Thorndike|first=Russell|title=The Scarecrow Rides|year=1935|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York|chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>) that wrecked his [[brig]] off the English coast in sight of Dymchurch. That night he went to the house of his old friend (and now squire) Anthony Cobtree. When news came that the local vicar had drowned while trying to save victims of the shipwreck, Squire Cobtree offered the post to Christopher Syn. Syn accepted and settled down to a more respectable life as the vicar of Dymchurch and [[Dean of Peculiars]] in Romney Marsh, Kent, resuming his original name.\n\nMipps arrived in Dymchurch with the intent of settling down. Syn made him the village [[sexton (office)|sexton]] upon condition that Mipps \"remember to forget\" (that Syn had been Clegg and that they had known each other before), and that Mipps never get involved with the local smugglers.\n\nSyn soon became aware that his parishioners were smuggling goods from France to avoid the excessive [[customs (tax)|customs]] duties the government charged. Learning from Mipps (who, contrary to Syn's orders, had become a leader of the smugglers) that certain townsfolk had been ambushed and captured during a smuggling run, Syn purchased the great black stallion [[Gehenna]] from gypsy horse-traders and raced to their rescue. A suit of clothing borrowed from a scarecrow made an improvised disguise, and Syn and Mipps were able to rescue the townsfolk from the [[Dragoons]].\n\nAfter this, Syn decided that he could only protect his people by becoming their leader. He created a more elaborate scarecrow costume, with eerie luminous paint. Riding Gehenna at night, the respectable Dr. Syn became \"The Scarecrow\", the feared head of the smugglers. Together with Mipps, he organized the smugglers into a well-organized band of \"Night Riders\", also called \"The Devil Riders\", with macabre disguises and code-names.\n\nSyn's cunning was so great that the smugglers outwitted the government forces for many years. A hidden stable watched over by Mother Handaway, the local \"witch\" (who believed the Scarecrow to be The Devil in living form), was the hiding place for the horses of the Scarecrow and his lieutenants, Mipps and the local highwayman Jimmie Bone (who, being as good a horseman as Syn and of similar build, was sometimes called upon to impersonate the Scarecrow when Syn either had to be elsewhere or seen in the same place.).\n\nShortly after the first appearances of the Scarecrow, Nicholas Tappitt (using the name \"Colonel Delacourt\") and the ailing Imogene returned to England, ending up in Dymchurch. Recognizing Syn as Clegg, Tappitt realized that Syn and the Scarecrow were the same and helped the authorities set a trap for him, hoping to both rid himself of his enemy and claim the reward for his capture. The trap was sprung, but Squire Cobtree's daughter Charlotte, who had fallen in love with Syn and also learned his secret identities as both Clegg and the Scarecrow, was the tragic victim when she dressed in the Scarecrow's disguise and was fatally wounded as a result. Tappitt was then suspected of being the Scarecrow, and a Customs officer and three constables came to arrest him. In the ensuing fight, Tappitt killed the Customs man and the constables subdued and arrested Tappitt for murdering the Customs officer.\n\nAfter Imogene's death in Syn's arms (during which she revealed to him that he had a son by her who was missing somewhere in America), Syn fought a final duel with Tappitt in his jail cell, defeating him. Syn then struck a bargain with Tappitt: If Tappitt confessed to being the notorious pirate Clegg, then Syn would look after and care for Tappitt and Imogene's new-born infant daughter (also named Imogene). Tappitt agreed, and \"Captain Clegg\" was hanged and later \"buried without benefit of clergy at a cross-roads hard by the Kent Ditch.\"\n\nMany years later, Captain Collyer, a Royal Navy officer assigned to smash the local smuggling ring, uncovered the deception and Dr. Syn's true identity, thanks in part to the tongueless mulatto (who had been rescued by Collyer years before and who had been serving Collyer as a \"ferret\" seeking out hidden contraband) who recognized Syn as Clegg. Syn evaded capture while at the same time making sure that Imogene and Squire Cobtree's son Denis (who had fallen in love with Imogene) would have a happy life together (they were eventually married), but was murdered in revenge by the mulatto, who then mysteriously managed to escape, leaving Syn harpooned through the neck. As a last mark of respect, Collyer ordered that Syn be buried at sea, rather than have his body hung in chains.\n\nMipps escaped in the confusion of Syn's death and disappeared from England, but it is said that a little man very much like him is living out his days in a Buddhist Monastery somewhere in the [[Malay Peninsula]], delighting the monks with recounting the adventures of Doctor Syn and the eerie stories of the Romney Marsh and the mysterious Scarecrow and his Night Riders.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Dr. Syn books detail his adventures and attempts to help the people of Dymchurch and the surrounding area evade the Excise tax. There are:\n* ''[[Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh]]'' (1915)\n* ''[[Doctor Syn on the High Seas]]'' (1935)\n* ''[[Doctor Syn Returns]]'' (1935)\n* ''[[Further Adventures of Doctor Syn]]'' (1936)\n* ''[[Courageous Exploits of Doctor Syn]]'' (1938)\n* ''[[Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn]]'' (1939)\n* ''[[Shadow of Doctor Syn]]'' (1944)\n\nNote that the \"first\" book, ''Doctor Syn,'' is actually the final story chronologically; the others proceed in published sequence.\n\nAn expanded version of ''Doctor Syn Returns'' titled ''The Scarecrow Rides'' was published for the US market by [[The Dial Press]] in 1935 and later re-printed in paperback by Black Curtain Press in 2013 ({{ISBN|978-1627554459}}).\n\nIn 1960, American author William Buchanan reworked Thorndike's ''Further Adventures of Doctor Syn'' under the title ''Christopher Syn'' (New York, Abelard Schuman), giving Thorndike co-authorship credit; this version provides a different conclusion and some conflation, renaming and even removal of the supporting characters. ''Christopher Syn'' became the basis for the 1962 Disney production (see below); there was also a novelization of the Disney theatrical version, titled ''Doctor Syn, Alias the Scarecrow'' and written by Vic Crume.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Films===\nThree film adaptations have been made of Dr. Syn's exploits.\n\n====''Doctor Syn'' (1937)====\nThe first, ''[[Doctor Syn (film)|Doctor Syn]]'' (1937), starred the actor [[George Arliss]] in the title role and was his last film.\n\n====''Captain Clegg'' (1962)====\n''[[Captain Clegg (film)|Captain Clegg]]'' (1962), known as ''Night Creatures'' in the U. S., was produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]] with actor [[Peter Cushing]] in the lead role, directed by [[Peter Graham Scott]]. In the screenplay by [[Anthony Hinds]], the main character's name was changed from Doctor Syn to Parson Blyss to avoid rights problems with Disney's forthcoming version, and ''Captain Clegg'''s screenplay follows the novel ''Doctor Syn'' and the screenplay of the 1937 film closely with the exception of a tightening of the plot. In the Arliss movie ''Doctor Syn'', Syn escapes to sea with Mipps and the rest of the Dymchurch smugglers, whereas ''Captain Clegg'' ends more faithfully to the novel, with Parson Blyss being killed by the mulatto (who is then killed by Mipps) and then being carried to and buried in Captain Clegg's empty grave by Mipps. ''Captain Clegg'' was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray in 2014; ''Night Creatures'' was never released on videotape in the United States, but is included in the 2014 two-disc DVD collection ''The Hammer Horror Series''.\n\n{{anchor|The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh}}<!-- Other articles link here. -->\n\n====''The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh'' (1963)====\n''The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh'' (1963) was produced for the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' TV series. It was shot on location in England and was directed by [[James Neilson (director)|James Neilson]]. It stars [[Patrick McGoohan]] in the title role, with [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Mipps and [[Sean Scully (actor)|Sean Scully]] as John Banks, the younger son of Squire Banks ([[Michael Hordern]]). Part One dealt with the arrival of General Pugh ([[Geoffrey Keen]]), who had been ordered by the War Office to smash the smuggling ring and prevent the Scarecrow from rescuing a Dymchurch man captured by a naval press gang as bait to trap the Scarecrow. Part Two depicted The Scarecrow dealing with the traitorous Joe Ransley ([[Patrick Wymark]]). Part Three showed how the Scarecrow rescued Harry Banks ([[David Buck]]) and American Simon Bates ([[Tony Britton]]) from General Pugh's clutches in Dover Castle.\n\nWhile originally conceived and edited for American television (and announced in an advertisement by NBC in the Tuesday, July 9, 1963 issue of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''), ''The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh'' was re-edited for a British theatrical run before the American television debut. Retitled ''Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow'', the British theatrical version was released on a double bill with ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', and ran during the 1963 Christmas season (advertised in the January 1964 issue of ''[[Photoplay]]''). This version was shown in Europe as well as Central and South America through 1966.\n\nIn the 1970s, the production was re-edited again for its first American theatrical release, on double bills with both ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]''. (The [[VHS]] version of the 1980s, sharing the removal of the Scarecrow's laugh from Terry Gilkyson's title song, was expanded to include the story material from all three TV episodes, while retaining feature film structure and credits; it was available for a relatively short amount of time.) Shortly after the US theatrical run, it was re-edited once more for a two-part presentation on Disney's television series in the 1970s, simply omitting the middle segment. The original three-part version was first shown as part of ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' on February 9, 16 and 23, 1964. Later it was included in a late 1980s ''Wonderful World of Disney'' syndication rerun package, and cablecast in 1990s on the [[Disney Channel]]. This version generally followed the storyline of ''The Further Adventures of Dr. Syn'' and made it clear that Syn did not die or stage his own death: at film's end, he is having a cup of tea with the Squire, who admits to now owing a debt of gratitude to the Scarecrow.\n\nOn November 11, 2008 [[The Walt Disney Company]] released a limited pressing of 39,500 issues of ''The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh'' in DVD format for the first time as a part of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Eight|Disney Treasures]]'' collection, and was now called ''Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh''. The issue sold out in three weeks, but as of February 17, 2009 the DVD was made available for members of the Disney movie club for $29.95. The two-disc set includes the American television version and the original British theatrical version ''Dr. Syn, Alias the Scarecrow'' in widescreen format. It also includes the original introductions by Walt Disney (in which he erroneously indicates that Dr. Syn was an actual historical figure) and a documentary on Disney's interest in the property.\n\n[[Old Romney#St Clement's Church|St Clement's Church]] in [[Old Romney]] doubled as Dr Syn\u2019s Dymchurch parish church in the production and Disney funded the repair of the building in order to use it as a filming location.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url= http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/04/dr-syn-the-scarecrow-of-romney-marsh-1964/|title=Kent Film Office Dr Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh Film Focus}}</ref>\n\n====Other adaptations====\nMade in 1974, ''[[Carry On Dick]]'', of the celebrated [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'' series of films]], followed the same premise of a country vicar ([[Sid James]]) who is secretly an outlaw, in this case the [[highwayman]] [[Dick Turpin]].\n\n===Theatre===\nIn 2001 a stage adaptation titled ''Doctor Syn'' was performed at churches throughout the [[Romney Marsh]], the final night being performed in [[Dymchurch]] itself. The cast featured Daniel Thorndike (the author's son), Michael Fields, Steven Povey and Ben Barton, along with various amateurs from the area.\n\n===Audio adaptations===\n;''Doctor Syn''\n\n[[Rufus Sewell]] read a 10-part audio adaptation combining and abridging ''Doctor Syn on the High Seas'' and ''Doctor Syn Returns'' for [[BBC Radio]], broadcast on [[BBC Radio 7]] in December 2006 and repeated in June 2007.\n\n;''The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn''\nA 10-part audio adaptation of ''The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn'' (combining and abridging ''The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn'' and ''The Shadow of Doctor Syn'') read by [[Rufus Sewell]] was performed on [[BBC Radio 7]] in December 2007.\n\n;''The Last of Doctor Syn'' \nIn April 2009, a third series was announced for broadcast later in 2009. [[BBC Radio 7]] broadcast the six-part series, an abridged reading by [[Rufus Sewell]] of the original ''Doctor Syn'' novel, from January 4, 2010 to January 11.\n\n;No Quarter \n[[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] reinterpreted elements of the Doctor Syn story as his \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]''.\n\n===Comic books===\nA three-issue adaptation of the Disney production was published by Gold Key Comics under the ''Scarecrow of Romney Marsh'' title, spanning April 1964 through October 1965.\n\nA much abridged revision of the adventures of Dr. Syn appeared as a short comic serialized in the monthly publication [[Disney Adventures]]. The new story features the heroic Doctor and his young sidekick protecting innocent villagers from corrupt government officials and soldiers. Disney Adventures would also produce a crossover story with the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' franchise where Dr. Syn meets [[Captain Jack Sparrow]].\n\nDoctor Syn appears in the ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' series as a member of the league gathered by [[Lemuel Gulliver]]. His alter ego, Captain Clegg, also makes appearances, where he is mentioned to have had a brief romantic liaison with future teammate [[Fanny Hill]].  In the 2003 film adaptation of ''League'', Dr. Syn can be spotted in one of the portraits hanging on the wall in M's library.\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\nA \"Days of Syn\" festival is held even-numbered years by [[Dymchurch]] residents for fund-raising. The 2006 \"Days of Syn\" was on 26\u201328 August (UK August Bank Holiday weekend) and featured a talk on Dr. Syn at the Anglican church at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. On Sunday at 3 p.m. there was a church service where Dr. Syn and the cast appeared in period costume. On Monday, starting at the Bowery Hall, scenes were reenacted from ''Doctor Syn'', and again during the day along the Dymchurch shoreline and in the Ocean pub.\n\nIn 2009, discussions took place to build a 100&nbsp;ft high statue of \"The Scarecrow\" on a site in the centre of Romney Marsh.<ref>[http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/stone-the-crows---a-100ft-scarec-a97102/ \"Scarecrow of the South\"], 4 June 2009</ref> This had not been done by 2016.\n\nDoctor Syn is also the name given to one of the locomotives on the [[Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway]].\n\nDoctor Syn also inspired novelist George Chittenden who captures smuggling on the Kent coast in his highly praised debut ''The Boy Who Led Them'', which follows the rise and fall of a smuggling gang leader further down the coast in the notorious town of Deal.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0028807|title=Doctor Syn}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0056277|title=Captain Clegg}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0055929|title=The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh}}\n* [http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Syn.htm The Life and Times of the Rev.

Weicker]] intended to be representative of system (integer) programming. The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor ([[CPU]]) performance. The name \"Dhrystone\" is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone]].<ref>[[Pun]]: [[Whetstone, Leicestershire|w'''h'''etstone]] \u2192 wet stone \u2192 dry stone \u2192 d'''h'''rystone.</ref>\n\nWith Dhrystone, Weicker gathered meta-data from a broad range of software, including programs written in [[FORTRAN]], [[PL/1]], SAL, [[ALGOL 68]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. He then characterized these programs in terms of various common constructs: procedure calls, pointer [[indirection]]s, assignments, etc. From this he wrote the Dhrystone benchmark to correspond to a representative mix.  Dhrystone was published in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], with the [[C (programming language)|C]] version for [[Unix]] developed by Rick Richardson (\"version 1.1\") greatly contributing to its popularity.\n\n==Dhrystone vs. Whetstone ==\nThe Dhrystone benchmark contains no [[floating point]] operations, thus the name is a pun on the then-popular [[Whetstone (benchmark)|Whetstone]] benchmark for floating point operations. The output from the benchmark is the number of Dhrystones per second (the number of iterations of the main code loop per second).\n\nBoth Whetstone and Dhrystone are ''synthetic'' benchmarks, meaning that they are simple programs that are carefully designed to statistically mimic the processor usage of some common set of programs. Whetstone, developed in 1972, originally strove to mimic typical Algol 60 programs based on measurements from 1970, but eventually became most popular in its Fortran version, reflecting the highly numerical orientation of computing in the 1960s.\n\n==Issues addressed by Dhrystone==\nDhrystone's eventual importance as an indicator of general-purpose (\"integer\") performance of new computers made it a target for commercial compiler writers. Various modern compiler [[static code analysis]] techniques (such as [[dead code elimination|elimination of dead code]]: for example, code which uses the processor but produces internal results which are not used or output) make the use and design of synthetic benchmarks more difficult. Version 2.0 of the benchmark, released by Weicker and Richardson in March 1988, had a number of changes intended to foil a range of compiler techniques. Yet it was carefully crafted so as not to change the underlying benchmark.  This effort to foil compilers was only partly successful.  Dhrystone 2.1, released in May of the same year, had some minor changes and {{As of|2010|7|lc=on}} remains the current definition of Dhrystone.\n\nOther than issues related to compiler optimization, various other issues have been cited with the Dhrystone. Most of these, including the small code size and small data set size, were understood at the time of its publication in 1984. More subtle is the slight over-representation of string operations, which is largely language-related: both Ada and Pascal have strings as normal variables in the language, whereas C does not, so what was simple variable assignment in reference benchmarks became buffer copy operations in the C library. Another issue is that the score reported does not include information which is critical when comparing systems such as which compiler was used, and what optimizations.\n\nDhrystone remains remarkably resilient as a simple benchmark, but its continuing value in establishing true performance is questionable.  It is easy to use, well documented, fully self-contained, well understood, and can be made to work on almost any system.  In particular, it has remained in broad use in the embedded computing world, though the recently developed '''[[EEMBC]]''' benchmark suite, HINT, Stream, and even Bytemark are widely quoted and used, as well as more specific benchmarks for the memory subsystem (Cachebench), TCP/IP (TTCP), and many others.\n\nDhrystone remains in use 30 years after it was designed by Weicker, a longer life than most software.\n\n==Dhrystone vs. CoreMark==\n[[CoreMark]] is a small benchmark released by the non-profit Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium ([[EEMBC]]) in 2009, that targets the CPU core, similar to Dhrystone. Both benchmarks are available free of charge and are small enough to execute on any processor, including small micro-controllers. CoreMark avoids issues such as the compiler computing the work during compile time, and uses real algorithms rather than being completely synthetic. CoreMark also has established rules for running the benchmark and for reporting the results.\n\n==Results ==\nDhrystone may represent a result more meaningfully than MIPS (million instructions per second) because instruction count comparisons between different instruction sets (e.g. [[RISC]] vs. [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]) can confound simple comparisons.  For example, the same high-level task may require many more instructions on a RISC machine, but might execute faster than a single CISC instruction.  Thus, the Dhrystone score counts only the number of program iteration completions per second, allowing individual machines to perform this calculation in a machine-specific way.  Another common representation of the Dhrystone benchmark is the '''DMIPS''' (Dhrystone [[million instructions per second|MIPS]]) obtained when the Dhrystone score is divided by 1757 (the number of Dhrystones per second obtained on the [[VAX|VAX 11/780]], nominally a 1 MIPS machine).\n\nAnother way to represent results is in DMIPS/MHz, where DMIPS result is further divided by CPU frequency, to allow for easier comparison of CPUs running at different [[clock rate]]s.\n\n==Shortcomings==\nUsing Dhrystone as a benchmark has pitfalls: \n* it features unusual code that is not usually representative of real-life programs<ref name=\"crit1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.johnloomis.org/NiosII/dhrystone/ECLDhrystoneWhitePaper.pdf | last=Weiss | first=Alan | title=Dhrystone Benchmark: History, Analysis, \"Scores\" and Recommendations | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726210001/http://www.johnloomis.org/NiosII/dhrystone/ECLDhrystoneWhitePaper.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-26 | df= }}</ref>\n* it is susceptible to compiler optimizations. For example, it does a lot of string copying in an attempt to measure string copying performance. However, the strings in Dhrystone are of known constant length and their starts are aligned on natural boundaries, two characteristics usually absent from real programs.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the term refers to any kind of drum, but outside Japan, it is used to refer to any of the various Japanese drums called {{nihongo4|''wadaiko''|\u548c\u592a\u9f13|\"Japanese drums\"}} and to the form of ensemble taiko drumming more specifically called {{nihongo4|''kumi-daiko''|\u7d44\u592a\u9f13|\"set of drums\"}}. The process of constructing taiko varies between manufacturers, and preparation of both the drum body and skin can take several years depending on method.\n\nTaiko have a mythological origin in [[Japanese folklore]], but historical records suggest that taiko were introduced to [[Japan]] through [[Korea]]n and [[China|Chinese]] cultural influence as early as the 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports the view that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the [[Kofun period]]. Their function has varied throughout history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also played a central role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.\n\n''Kumi-daiko'' performance, characterized by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of [[Daihachi Oguchi]] and has continued with groups such as [[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo]]. Other performance styles, such as ''hachij\u014d-daiko'', have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. ''Kumi-daiko'' performance groups are active not only in Japan, but also in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Taiwan, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, [[kata|form]], [[drum stick|stick]] grip, clothing, and the [[instrumentation (music)|particular instrumentation]]. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped ''nagad\u014d-daiko'' as well as smaller ''[[shime-daiko]]''. Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\n[[File:ThreeHaniwa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haniwa]], dated to the 6th century CE.

Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588&nbsp;CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the [[Kakko (instrument)|kakko]], a drum that originated in [[South China]]. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko.{{sfn|Blades|1992|pp=122\u2013123}} Certain court music styles, especially [[gigaku]] and [[gagaku]], arrived in Japan through both Korea and China.{{sfn|Nelson|2007||pp=36, 39}}{{sfn|Schuller|1989|p=202}} In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko.{{sfn|Schuller|1989|p=202}}{{sfn|Coss\u00edo|2001|p=179}} Certain percussive patterns and terminology in [[togaku]], an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=26}}{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|pp=108, 110}}\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that taiko were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE,<ref name=TNM>{{cite web|title=Music Festival at the Museum|url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=684|publisher=Tokyo National Museum|accessdate=24 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054639/http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=684|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}</ref> during the latter part of the [[Kofun period]], and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals.{{sfn|Dean|2012|p=122}} This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of [[haniwa]] statues in the [[Sawa District, Gunma|Sawa District]] of [[Gunma Prefecture]].

The myth tells how [[Amaterasu]], who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto|Ame-no-Uzume]] when others had failed.

According to the war chronicle ''Gunji Yosh\u016b'', nine sets of five beats would summon an ally to battle, while nine sets of three beats, sped up three or four times, was the call to advance and pursue an enemy.{{sfn|Turnbull|2008|p=49}} Folklore from the 16th century on the legendary 6th-century [[Emperor Keitai]] offers a story that he obtained a large drum from China, which he named {{nihongo4|''Senjin-daiko''|\u7dda\u9663\u592a\u9f13|\"front drum\"}}.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}} The Emperor was thought to have used it to both encourage his own army and intimidate his enemies.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=12}}\n\n===In traditional settings===\nTaiko have been incorporated in Japanese theatre for rhythmic needs, general atmosphere, and in certain settings decoration. In the [[kabuki]] play ''The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles'', scenes in the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure quarters]] are accompanied by taiko to create dramatic tension.{{sfn|Brandon|Leiter|2002|p=86}} [[Noh]] theatre also feature taiko{{sfn|Miki|2008|p=176}}{{sfn|Malm|2000|pp=286\u2013288}} where performance consists of highly specific rhythmic patterns.

The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead.{{sfn|Carlsen|2009|p=131}} Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden [[dowel]]s or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}}{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=36}} Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=18}} Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called ''by\u014d'', are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; ''ch\u016b-daiko'' require about 300 of them for each side.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=19}} After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.{{sfn|Gould|1998|p=19}}\n\n===Drum makers===\nSeveral companies specialize in the production of taiko.

For instance, many pieces developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=60}}\n\n===Form===\n[[Kata]] is a term used to describe the posture and movement associated with taiko performance.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=73\u201374}} The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the [[hara (tanden)|hara]] is the center of being.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=89}} Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=10}} For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=122}} An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight.{{sfn|Powell 2012a}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=94}} It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=94}} Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=201}}\n\nSome groups in Japan, particularly those active in Tokyo, also emphasize the importance of the lively and spirited ''[[Iki (aesthetics)|iki]]'' aesthetic.{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=58}} In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868).{{sfn|Bender|2005|p=58}}\n\n[[File:Taikos bachi.jpg|thumb|right|''Bachi'' are sticks used specifically for taiko performance, and can be slightly thicker than typical [[drum sticks]].|alt=Different types of drum sticks for taiko, called bachi, are displayed flat on a surface.]]\nThe sticks for playing taiko are called ''bachi'', and are made in various sizes and from different kinds of wood such as [[Quercus alba|white oak]], [[bamboo]], and [[Japanese magnolia]].{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=59}} ''Bachi'' are also held in a number of different styles.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=92}} In ''kumi-daiko'', it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=92}} There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the ''shime'' grip, which is similar to a [[matched grip]]:  the ''bachi'' are gripped at the back end, and the [[fulcrum (drumming)|fulcrum]] rests between the performer's index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.<ref name=ModernP>{{cite journal|magazine=Modern Percussionist|title=N/A|volume=3|year=1986|publisher=Modern Drummer Publications, Inc.|page=28|oclc=11672313}}</ref>\n\nPerformance in some groups is also guided by principles based on [[Zen Buddhism]].  For instance, among other concepts, the San Francisco Taiko Dojo is guided by {{nihongo4|''rei''|\u793c}} emphasizing communication, respect, and harmony.{{sfn|Wong|2004|p=84}} The way the ''bachi'' are held can also be significant; for some groups, ''bachi'' represent a spiritual link between the body and the sky.{{sfn|Powell 2012b|loc=''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gGlX7c66X1sC&q=%22body+and+sky%22#v=onepage&q=%22Buddhism%22&f=falsev Ki]''}} Some physical parts of taiko, like the drum body, its skin, and the tacks also hold symbolic significance in Buddhism.{{sfn|Powell 2012b|loc=''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gGlX7c66X1sC&q=%22body+and+sky%22#v=onepage&q=%22Buddhism%22&f=falsev Ki]''}}\n\n===Instrumentation===\n[[File:Traditional-taikodrum-may2011.ogv|thumb|Several drummers perform a traditional pattern on a taiko drum at a summer festival in Japan.|alt=Video; refer to caption]]\n\n''Kumi-daiko'' groups consist primarily of percussive instruments where each of the drums plays a specific role. Of the different kinds of taiko, the most common in groups is the ''nagad\u014d-daiko''.{{sfn|Dean|2012|p=125}} ''Ch\u016b-daiko'' are common in taiko groups{{sfn|Powell 2012a}} and represent the main rhythm of the group, whereas ''shime-daiko'' set and change tempo.{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=55}} ''\u014c-daiko'' provide a steady, underlying pulse{{sfn|Alves|2012|p=312}} and serve as a counter-rhythm to the other parts.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=70, 72}} It is common for performances to begin with a [[single stroke roll]] called an ''{{Nihongo4|oroshi|\u98aa|\"wind blowing down from mountains\"}}''.{{sfn|Powell 2012a|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xlZh8b-YXMgC&q=oroshi#v=onepage&q=oroshi&f=false chpt. 7]}} The player starts slowly, leaving considerable space between strikes, gradually shortening the interval between hits, until the drummer is playing a rapid roll of hits.{{sfn|Powell 2012a|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xlZh8b-YXMgC&q=oroshi#v=onepage&q=oroshi&f=false chpt. 7]}} Oroshi are also played as a part of theatrical performance, such as in Noh theater.{{sfn|Malm|1960|pp=75\u201378}}\n\nDrums are not the only instruments played in the ensemble; other Japanese instruments are also used. Other kinds of percussion instruments include the {{nihongo4|''atarigane''|\u5f53\u308a\u9266}}, a hand-sized gong played with a small mallet.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=32}} In kabuki, the [[shamisen]], a [[plucked string instrument]], often accompanies taiko during the theatrical performance.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=29}} ''Kumi-daiko'' performances can also feature woodwinds such as the [[shakuhachi]]{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=287}} and the [[shinobue]].{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=288}}{{sfn|Forss|2010|p=597}}\n\nVoiced calls or shouts called [[kakegoe]] and [[kiai]] are also common in taiko performance.{{sfn|Nelson|2007|p=139}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=62}} They are used as encouragement to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=29, 51}} In contrast, the philosophical concept of [[Ma (negative space)|ma]], which superficially describes the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.{{sfn|Varian|2013|pp=89\u201390, 125}}\n\n===Clothing===\nThere is a wide variety of traditional clothing that players wear during taiko performance. Common in many ''kumi-daiko'' groups is the use of the [[happi]], a decorative, thin-fabric coat, and traditional headbands called [[hachimaki]].{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=150}} [[Tabi]], {{nihongo4|''momohiki''|\u3082\u3082\u5f15\u304d|\"loose-fitting pants\"}}, and {{nihongo4|''haragake''|\u8179\u639b\u3051|\"working aprons\"}} are also typical.{{sfn|Konagaya|2010|p=645}} During his time with the group Ondekoza, Eitetsu Hayashi suggested that a loincloth called a [[fundoshi]] be worn when performing for French fashion designer [[Pierre Cardin]], who saw Ondekoza perform for him in 1975.<ref name=UofC>{{cite journal|title=N/A|journal=Asian Music|volume=40|year=2009|publisher=Society for Asian Music|page=108|oclc=53164383}}</ref> The Japanese group Kodo has sometimes worn fundoshi for its performances.{{sfn|Konagaya|2005|p=151}}\n\n==Education==\nTaiko performance is generally taught orally and through demonstration.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=115}}{{sfn|Malm|1986|p=24}} Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, such as in the 1512 encyclopedia called the ''[[Taigensho]]'',{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|p=394}} but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently.{{sfn|Malm|1986|p=202}} Furthermore, ethnomusicologist William&nbsp;P. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening.{{sfn|Malm|1986|pp=24\u201325}} In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.{{sfn|Harich-Schneider|1973|p=394}}\n\nOrally, patterns of [[onomatopoeia]] called [[kuchi sh\u014dga]] are taught from teacher to student that convey the rhythm and [[timbre]] of drum strikes for a particular piece.{{sfn|Tusler|2003|pp=90, 271}}{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=90}} For example, {{nihongo4|''don''|\u3069\u3093}} represents a single strike to the center of the drum,{{sfn|Varian|2013|p=90}} where as {{nihongo4|''do-ko''|\u3069\u3053}} represents two successive strikes, first by the right and then the left, and lasts the same amount of time as one ''don'' strike.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}} Some taiko pieces, such as ''[[Yatai-bayashi]]'', include patterns that are difficult to represent in [[List of musical symbols|Western musical notation]].{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}} The exact words used can also differ from region to region.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=139}}\n\nMore recently, Japanese publications have emerged in an attempt to standardize taiko performance. The [[Nippon Taiko Foundation]] was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=129}} Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote ''Japan Taiko'' with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=183}} The instructional publication described the different drums used in ''kumi-daiko'' performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=184}}\n\nThe system of fundamentals ''Japan Taiko'' put forward was not widely adopted because taiko performance varied substantially across Japan. An updated 2001 publication from the Foundation, called the {{nihongo4|''Nihon Taiko Ky\u014dhon''|\u65e5\u672c\u592a\u9f13\u6559\u672c|\"Japan Taiko Textbook\"}}, describes regional variations that depart from the main techniques taught in the textbook. The creators of the text maintained that mastering a set of prescribed basics should be compatible with learning local traditions.{{sfn|Bender|2012|pp=185\u2013187}}\n\n==Regional styles==\nAside from ''kumi-daiko'' performance, a number of folk traditions that use taiko have been recognized in different regions in Japan.  Some of these include {{nihongo4|''ondeko''|\u9b3c\u592a\u9f13|\"demon drumming\"}} from [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|gion-daiko|ja|3=\u5c0f\u5009\u7947\u5712\u592a\u9f13}}'' from the town of [[Kokura]], and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|sansa-odori|ja|3=\u76db\u5ca1\u3055\u3093\u3055\u8e0a\u308a}}'' from [[Iwate Prefecture]].{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=225}}\n\n===Eisa===\n[[File:An eisa folk dancing troupe performs at the 2010 Okinawa International Carnival Nov 101127-F-HZ730-008.jpg|thumb|Eisa are folk dances from Okinawa that involve the use of taiko while dancing.|alt=An eisa folk dancing troupe performs at night at the 2010 Okinawa International Carnival.]]\n{{main|Eisa (dance)}}\nA variety of folk dances originating from [[Okinawa]], known collectively as [[Eisa (dance)|eisa]], often make use of the taiko.{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=234}} Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles:{{sfn|Kumada|2011|pp=193\u2013244}} groups on the [[Uruma, Okinawa#Yokatsu Islands|Yokatsu Peninsula]] and on Hamahiga Island use small, single-sided drums called {{nihongo4|''p\u0101ranku''|\u30d1\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30af}} whereas groups near [[Okinawa, Okinawa|the city of Okinawa]] generally use ''shime-daiko''.{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=234}}{{sfn|Kobayashi|1998|pp=36\u201340}} Use of ''shime-daiko'' over ''p\u0101ranku'' has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1998|pp=36\u201340}} Small ''nagad\u014d-daiko'', referred to as ''\u014d-daiko'' within the tradition, are also used{{sfn|Cangia|2013|p=149}} and are worn in front of the performer.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=210}} These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Hawaii]], and large cities on the [[Honshu|Japanese mainland]].{{sfn|Terada|2013|p=235}}\n\n===Hachij\u014d-daiko===\n[[File:Hachijo taiko 2007-03-21-alt.jpg|thumb|left|Hachij\u014d-daiko is a music tradition involving two players on a single drum.|alt=Two women wearing kimonos perform traditional Hachij\u014d-daiko.]]\n{{nihongo4|''Hachij\u014d-daiko''|\u516b\u4e08\u592a\u9f13||trans. \"Hachij\u014d-style taiko\"}} is a taiko tradition originating on the island of [[Hachij\u014d-jima]].{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=171}} Two styles of ''Hachij\u014d-daiko'' emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=171}}\n\nThe ''Hachij\u014d-daiko'' tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named [[Kakuso Kizan]]. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=2}} Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of ''Hachij\u014d-daiko''. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=3}}\n\n[[File:Hachijo-style taiko performance.webm|thumb|right|A performance in Hachij\u014d-daiko style.

This style is called ''Kumaoji-daiko'', named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=5}} ''Kumaoji-daiko'' has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the {{nihongo4|''shita-by\u014dshi''|\u4e0b\u62cd\u5b50|\"lower beat\"}}, provides the underlying beat.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}} The other player, called the {{nihongo4|''uwa-by\u014dshi''|\u4e0a\u62cd\u5b50|\"upper beat\"}}, builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Honda|1984|p=931}} While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=8}} ''Kumaoji-daiko'' also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes,{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=7}} and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=2}}\n\nThe contemporary style of ''Hachij\u014d-daiko'' is called {{nihongo4|''shin-daiko''|\u65b0\u592a\u9f13|\"new taiko\"}}, which differs from ''Kumaoji-daiko'' in multiple ways.  For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, ''shin-daiko'' performances use larger drums exclusively on stands.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|pp=14, 18\u201319}} ''Shin-daiko'' emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=19}} Looser clothing is worn by ''shin-daiko'' performers compared to [[kimono]] worn by ''Kumaoji-daiko'' performers; the looser clothing in ''shin-daiko'' allow performers to adopt more open stances and larger movements with the legs and arms.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|pp=14, 19}} Rhythms used for the accompanying ''shita-by\u014dshi'' role can also differ.  One type of rhythm, called ''y\u016bkichi'', consists of the following: \n{{clear}}\n[[File:Yukichi.png|alt=Music notation indicating a drum rhythm|center]]\n\nThis rhythm is found in both styles, but is always played faster in ''shin-daiko''.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=14}} Another type of rhythm, called ''honbadaki'', is unique to ''shin-daiko'' and also contains a song which is performed in standard Japanese.{{sfn|Alaszewska|2008|p=14}}\n\n===Miyake-daiko===\n{{nihongo4|''Miyake-daiko''|\u4e09\u5b85\u592a\u9f13||trans. \"Miyake-style taiko\"}} is a style that has spread amongst groups through Kodo, and is formally known as {{nihongo4|''Miyake-jima Kamitsuki mikoshi-daiko''|\u4e09\u5b85\u5cf6\u795e\u7740\u795e\u8f3f\u592a\u9f13}}.{{sfn|Bender|2012|p=98}} The word ''miyake'' comes from [[Miyake-jima]], part of the [[Izu Islands]], and the word ''Kamitsuki'' refers to the village where the tradition came from.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Dolly Parton made her album debut in 1967, with her album ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s; Parton's subsequent albums in the later part of the 1990s were lower in sales. However, in the new millennium, Parton achieved commercial success again and has released albums on independent labels since 2000, including albums on her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton is the most honored female country performer of all time. Achieving 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified Gold, Platinum, and Multi-Platinum awards, she has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered nine [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, notably \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper for Parton, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee]]; a very small community located in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her eleven pregnancies (the tenth pregnancy being twins) in twenty years made her a mother of twelve at thirty five years of age. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}} \nWhile she was still very young, Dolly Parton's parents moved their growing family to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of Parton's cherished memories of youth happened while living there, and it was also the place for which she was inspired to write the song, \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" in the 1970s. Parton would buy back the Locust Ridge property in the 1980s.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}\n\nDolly Parton's middle name comes from her maternal great-great grandmother, Rebecca (Dunn) Whitted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/dolly-parton.html;jsessionid=9CECAFF05AFFF508B71898273634EA3A |publisher=thebiographychannel.co.uk |accessdate=January 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815072234/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/dolly-parton.html%3Bjsessionid%3D9CECAFF05AFFF508B71898273634EA3A |archivedate=August 15, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Dolly-Parton.html|title=Dolly Parton bio|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref> She has described her family as being \"dirt poor.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton talks new album, tour|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/09/dolly.parton.cnna/index.html|accessdate=July 14, 2014|publisher=CNN|date=July 9, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512112052/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/09/dolly.parton.cnna/index.html|archivedate=May 12, 2006}}</ref> Parton's father paid the doctor who helped deliver her with a bag of [[cornmeal]].

She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby,\" did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition, \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow,\" as recorded by Bill Phillips (and with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy,\" which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a cover of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]],\" was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo effort \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]],\" which later became a standard \u2013 was as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers's]] \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]],\" a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"Joshua.\" For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss,\" (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]],\" (1972)  \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]],\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net |title=Dolly Parton Entertainment |accessdate=October 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/ |archivedate=June 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]].\" Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100. (It eventually also charted in the UK, reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first UK success). Parton, who'd always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

Parton had her own syndicated television variety show, ''[[Dolly!]]'' (1976\u201377) During this period, many performers, including [[Rose Maddox]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] covered her songs. Her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\nDuring this period, Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]],'' which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]],'' (1977) highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With Carol Burnett, 1980]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with \"[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]],\" (1978) \"[[Baby I'm Burning]],\" (1979) and \"[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]],\" (1979) all of which charted in the pop [[Top 40]] and topped the country chart. \"[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]\" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher... Special|television special]], and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''Carol and Dolly in Nashville''.\n\nParton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]],\" \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]],\" and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]],\" which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans,\" a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5,\"  not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one  hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You,\" from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]],\" \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]],\" \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]],\" (1984) \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]],\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10. (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired that year, and she signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1987.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\n===1987\u20132005: Country and bluegrass period===\nAlong with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], she released ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one  on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard's'' Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]],\" which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]],\" Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one  hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]].\" Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came on in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the chart.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nA duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], \"[[Rockin' Years]].\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]],'' however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released ''[[Honky Tonk Angels]]'' in the fall of 1993 with [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/parton_dolly/bio.jhtml \"Dolly Parton Biography.\"] [[Country Music Television]]; retrieved February 12, 2012.</ref> It was certified as [[Oro album|a gold album]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and helped revive both Wynette and Lynn's careers.

The following year, ''[[Treasures (Dolly Parton album)|Treasures]]'', an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by [[Mac Davis]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Neil Young]]. Her recording of Stevens' \"[[Peace Train]]\" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, \"(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs\" and \"Salt in my Tears,\" charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on [[Country Music Television|CMT]]. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, ''[[Trio II]],'' was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young's song \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]].

In the 1840s [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] discovered many ''Diprotodon'' bones eroding from the banks of creeks in the [[Darling Downs]] of [[Queensland]] and when reporting the find to Owen commented that the remains were so well preserved he expected to find living examples in the then-unexplored central regions of Australia.\n\nThe majority of fossil finds are of demographic groups indicative of diprotodonts dying in drought conditions. For example, hundreds of individuals were found in [[Lake Callabonna]] with well-preserved lower bodies but crushed and distorted heads.<ref name = Price2006/> It is theorised several family groups sank in mud while crossing the drying lake bed. Other finds consist of age groupings of young or old animals which are first to die during a drought.\n\nIn 2012, a significant group of about 40 was found at [[Eulo, Queensland|Eulo]], South-West Queensland.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-21/giant-marsupial-fossils-found-in-queensland/4083158 Giant marsupials' graveyard unearthed in Queensland]\nBy Chrissy Arthur - Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Retrieved 21 July 2012.</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Diprotodon'' was named by Owen (1838). It was assigned to Diprotodontidae by McKenna and Bell (1997). The historical classification of ''Diprotodon'' consisted of eight species (''Diprotodon optatum'' Owen, 1838; ''Diprotodon australis'' Owen, 1844; ''D. annextans'' McCoy, 1861; ''D. minor'' Huxley, 1862; ''D. longiceps'' McCoy 1865; ''D. loderi'' Krefft, 1873a; ''D. bennettii'' Krefft, 1873b (nec ''D. bennettii'' Owen, 1877); and ''D. bennettii'' Owen, 1877 (nec ''D. bennettii'' Krefft, 1873b); based on size or slight morphological differences of single specimens collected from isolated geographic regions.<ref name=Price2006/> Bimodal dental sizes, rather than a continuum of tooth sizes, and identical male and female dental morphology, indicate sexual dimorphism instead of separate species, thus providing strong evidence that the eight species are synonyms for ''D. optatum''.<ref name=Price2006/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Diprotodon-Human Size comparison.svg|thumb|left|''Diprotodon'' compared to a human]]\n''Diprotodon'' superficially resembled a [[rhinoceros]] without a horn. Its feet turned inwards like a wombat\u2019s, giving it a pigeon-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet and its pouch opening faced backwards. Footprints of its feet have been found showing a covering of hair which indicates it had a coat similar to a modern wombat.\n\nUntil recently it was unknown how many species of ''Diprotodon'' had existed. Eight species are described although many researchers believed these actually represented only three at most while some estimated there could be around twenty in total.\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Diprotodon optatum (2).jpg|thumb|Restoration]]\nRecent research compared the variation between all of the described ''Diprotodon'' species with the variation in one of Australia\u2019s largest living marsupials, the [[eastern grey kangaroo]], and found the range was comparable, with a near continent-wide distribution.<ref name=Price2006>{{cite journal|last = Price|first= G. J.|date=August 2006|title=Taxonomy and palaeobiology of the largest-ever marsupial, ''Diprotodon'' Owen, 1838 (Diprotodontidae, Marsupialia)|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=153| pages =369\u2013397|doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2008.00387.x|issue = 2}}</ref> This left only two possible ''Diprotodon'' species differing only in size with the smaller being around half the size of the larger. According to [[Georgii Gause|Gause]]\u2019s \"[[competitive exclusion principle]]\" no two species with identical ecological requirements can coexist in a stable environment. However, both the small and large diprotodonts coexisted throughout the Pleistocene and the size difference is similar to other [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] living marsupials. Further evidence is the battle damage common in competing males found on the larger specimens but absent from the smaller. Dental morphology also supports sexual dimorphism, with highly sexually dimorphic marsupials, such as the grey kangaroo, having different tooth sizes between males and females, but both sexes having the same dental morphology. An identical dental morphology occurs in the large and small ''Diprotodon''.<ref name=Price2006/> The taxonomic implication is that Owen\u2019s original ''Diprotodon optatum'' is the only valid species.\n\nA single sexually dimorphic species allows behavioural interpretations. All sexually dimorphic species of over {{convert|5|kg}} exhibit a [[Polygyny|polygynous]] breeding strategy. A modern example of this is the gender segregation of [[elephant]]s where females and the young form family groups while lone males fight for the right to mate with all the females of the group. This behaviour is consistent with fossil finds where adult/juvenile fossil assemblages usually contain only female adult remains.<ref>[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2042/sex-secrets-prehistoric-marsupial-uncovered Sex secrets of a prehistoric marsupial] ''[[Cosmos Magazine]]'' 11 June 2008</ref><ref>''[[Australian Science Magazine]]'' June 2008 Pleistocene Goliath; Gilbert Price</ref>\n\nCyclic variations in the [[strontium]] isotope ratios within the tooth enamel of a 300,000 year old fossil imply that ''Diprotodon'' undertook seasonal migrations, making it the only known extinct or extant metatherian to do so.<ref name=\"Price2017\">{{cite journal|last1= Price|first1=G.

From time to time the process reversed for a period, but overall the trend has been strongly toward lower rainfall. The [[Quaternary glaciation|recent ice age]]s produced no significant glaciation in mainland Australia but long periods of cold and very dry weather. This dry weather during the last ice age may have killed off all the large diprotodonts.\n\nCritics point out a number of problems with this theory. First, large diprotodonts had already survived a long series of similar ice ages, and there does not seem to be any particular reason the most recent one should have achieved what all the previous ice ages had failed to do. Also, climate change apparently peaked 25,000 years ''after'' the extinctions. Finally, even during climatic extremes, some parts of the continent always remain relatively exempt: for example, the tropical north stays fairly warm and wet in all climatic circumstances; alpine valleys are less affected by drought, and so on.\n\n===Human hunting===\nThe [[Quaternary extinction event#Hunting hypothesis|overkill theory]] is that human hunters killed and ate the diprotodonts, causing their extinction. The extinctions appear to have coincided with the arrival of humans on the continent, and in broad terms, ''Diprotodon'' was the largest and least well-defended species that died out. Similar hunting-out happened with the [[megafauna]] of [[List of extinct New Zealand animals|New Zealand]], [[Fauna of Madagascar#Malagasy fauna (extinct)|Madagascar]] and many smaller islands around the world (such as [[Biodiversity of New Caledonia#Faunal Biodiversity|New Caledonia]], [[Prehistoric Cyprus#Epipalaeolithic|Cyprus]], [[Prehistoric Crete|Crete]] and at least in part, in the [[Americas]]), probably within a thousand years or so. Recent finds of ''Diprotodon'' bones which appear to display butchering marks lend support to this theory. Critics of this theory regard it as simplistic, arguing that (unlike New Zealand and America) there is little direct evidence of hunting, and that the dates on which the theory rests are too uncertain to be relied on. However, the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna.<ref name = \"Biello\">{{cite web\n | last = Biello | first = D. \n | title = Big Kill, Not Big Chill, Finished Off Giant Kangaroos\n | work = Scientific American news\n | publisher = | date = 2012-03-22\n | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=hunters-killed-off-big-animals-australia\n | accessdate = 2012-03-25}}</ref><ref name = \"McGlone\">{{cite journal\n | last = McGlone | first = M.  \n | title = The Hunters Did It\n | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n | volume = 335 | issue = 6075 | pages = 1452\u20131453\n | publisher = | location = | date = 2012-03-23 \n | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6075/1452.summary\n | doi = 10.1126/science.1220176 | id =\n | accessdate = 2012-03-25|bibcode = 2012Sci...335.1452M }}</ref><ref name = \"Rule\">{{cite journal\n | last = Rule | first = S. |author2=Brook, B.

In particular, early Aboriginal people are thought to have been [[Fire-stick farming|fire-stick farmers]] using fire regularly and persistently to drive game, open up dense thickets of vegetation, and create fresh green regrowth for both humans and game animals to eat. Evidence for the fire hypothesis is the sudden increase in widespread ash deposits at the time that people arrived in Australia, as well as land-management and hunting practices of modern [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] people as recorded by the earliest European settlers before Aboriginal society was devastated by European contact and [[disease]]. Evidence against the hypothesis is the fact that humans appear to have eliminated the megafauna of [[Tasmania]] without using fire to modify the environment there.<ref name = \"Diamond\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = Diamond | first = Jared  | authorlink = Jared Diamond\n  | title = Palaeontology: The last giant kangaroo\n  | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 454 | issue =  7206| pages = 835\u2013836\n  | publisher =  | location =  | date = 13 August 2008 \n  | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7206/full/454835a.html\n  | doi = 10.1038/454835a | accessdate = 8 May 2011 | pmid=18704074|bibcode = 2008Natur.454..835D }}</ref><ref name = \"Turney\">{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Turney | first1 = C.

Each of proposed mechanisms can potentially support the other two. For example, while burning an area of fairly thick forest and thus turning it into a more open, grassy environment might reduce the viability of a large browser (an animal that eats leaves and shoots rather than grasses), the reverse could also be true: removing the browsing animals (by eating them, or by any other means) within a few years produces a very thick undergrowth which, when a fire eventually starts through natural causes (as fires tend to do every few hundred years), burns with greater than usual ferocity. The burnt-out area is then repopulated with a greater proportion of fire-loving plant species (notably [[eucalypt]]s, some [[acacia]]s, and most of the native grasses) which are unsuitable habitat for most browsing animals. Either way, the trend is toward the modern Australian environment of highly flammable open [[sclerophyllous]] forests, woodlands and grasslands, none of which are suitable for large, slow-moving browsing animals\u2014and either way, the changed microclimate produces substantially less rainfall.\n\nAn examination of swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from [[Lynch's Crater]] in [[Queensland]] suggests that hunting may have been the primary cause of the extinction. Analysis of ''[[Sporormiella]]'' fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in the cores shows that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when climate changes were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] vegetation.<ref name = \"Biello\"/><ref name = \"McGlone\"/><ref name = \"Rule\"/> The high-resolution chronology of the changes indicates that fire increased about a century after the disappearance of browsing megafauna, probably due to accumulation of fuel. Grass increased over the next several centuries; sclerophyll vegetation increased following a lag of another century, and a sclerophyll forest developed about a thousand years later.<ref name = \"Rule\"/> Earlier increases in sclerophyll vegetation during shifts to cooler, drier conditions about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago did not have any obvious impact on megafaunal abundance.<ref name = \"Rule\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Extinct and endangered species|Paleontology|Prehistoric mammals}}\n*[[Australian megafauna]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==<!-- ZoolJLinnSoc153:369. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Diprotodon}}\n{{Wikispecies|Diprotodon}}\n*[http://australianmuseum.net.au/Australias-extinct-animals Australia's lost kingdom on ''Diprotodon optatum'']\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/3040.shtml BBC science and nature on ''Diprotodon optatum'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811001337/http://www.goyder.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=301 Regional Council of Goyder page on the genera]\n*[http://museumvictoria.com.au/prehistoric/mammals/diprotodontids.html Museum Victoria on the Diprotodontids]\n*[http://museumvictoria.com.au/treasures/colldetails.aspx?pid=66 Museum Victoria view of a ''Diprotodon'' skull]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002534/http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/lop/diprotodon.pdf South Australian Museum information]\n*[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200505/s1379450.htm Description of Price's research]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Danielle Clode (2009) Prehistoric giants: the megafauna of Australia.

From left: Dirk Benedict, [[Ted Hartley]], [[Jim McMullan]].]]\n\nBenedict's film debut was in the 1972 film ''[[Georgia, Georgia]]''. When the New York run for ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in [[Hawaii]], opposite [[Barbara Rush]]. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. He also appeared on the \"Donny & Marie\" variety show.\n\nBenedict's career break came in 1978 when he appeared as [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] in the movie and television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. The same year Benedict starred in the TV movie ''Cruise Into Terror'', and appeared in the ensemble movie ''[[Scavenger Hunt]]'' the following year.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn 1980, Benedict starred alongside [[Linda Blair]] in an action-comedy movie called ''[[Ruckus (film)|Ruckus]]''. In 1983, Dirk gained further popularity as con-man Lieutenant Templeton \"Face\" Peck in 1980s action television series ''[[The A-Team]]''. He played \"Faceman\" from {{start date|1982}} to {{end date|1986}}, although the series didn't air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn't shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983\u20131984|second season]] episode \"Steel\" includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''. The clip is incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.\n\nIn 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'' along with [[Lou Albano]], [[Roddy Piper]], and cameo appearances by [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]]. His character Smilac ends up managing the pro-wrestler \"Quick Rick\" Roberts (Piper) and faces opposition by Captain Lou and his wrestling tag-team \"[[The Wild Samoans|the Cannibals]]\".\n\nIn 1987, Benedict took the title role of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Classic Stage Company|Abbey Theatre]] in Manhattan.

Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are traveling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves \"bunch together\".  Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves \"spread out\".\n\nFor waves that propagate in a medium, such as [[sound]] waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted.<ref name=\"Giordano\" /> The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium, such as [[light]] or [[gravity]] in [[general relativity]], only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.\n\n==History==\nDoppler first proposed this effect in 1842 in his treatise \"''[[\u00dcber das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]''\" (On the coloured light of the [[binary stars]] and some other stars of the heavens).<ref name=\"AlecEden\">Alec Eden ''The search for Christian Doppler'', Springer-Verlag, Wien 1992.

If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a [[monotonic]] decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt.

Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is moving away from the man. So it is actually the ''wavelength'' which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.\n\nWith an observer stationary relative to the medium, if a moving source is emitting waves with an actual frequency <math>f_\\text{0}</math> (in this case, the wavelength is changed, the transmission velocity of the wave keeps constant note that the ''transmission velocity'' of the wave does not depend on the ''velocity of the source''), then the observer detects waves with a frequency <math>f</math> given by\n\n:<math>f = \\left ( \\frac {c}{c \\pm v_\\text{s}} \\right ) f_0</math>\n\nA similar analysis for a moving ''observer'' and a stationary source (in this case, the wavelength keeps constant, but due to the motion, the rate at which the observer receives waves <math>\\text{--}</math> and hence the ''transmission velocity'' of the wave [with respect to the observer] <math>\\text{--}</math> is changed) yields the observed frequency:\n\n:<math>f = \\left ( \\frac {c \\pm v_\\text{r}}{c} \\right ) f_0</math>\n\nThese can be generalized into the equation that was presented in the previous section.\n\n:<math>f = \\left ( \\frac {c\\pm v_\\text{r}}{c \\pm v_\\text{s}} \\right ) f_0</math>\n\nAn interesting effect was predicted by Lord Rayleigh in his classic book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but ''backwards''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strutt (Lord Rayleigh)|first=John William|title=The Theory of Sound|editor=MacMillan & Co|date=1896|edition=2|volume=2|pages=154|url=https://archive.org/stream/theorysound02raylgoog#page/n176/mode/2up}}</ref> The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters.  Neil A Downie has demonstrated <ref>Downie, Neil A, 'Vacuum Bazookas, Electric Rainbow Jelly and 27 other projects for Saturday Science', Princeton (2001) {{ISBN|0-691-00986-4}}</ref> how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40&nbsp;kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a heterodyne frequency converter, as used in many bat detectors, to listen to a band around 40&nbsp;kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000&nbsp;Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240&nbsp;Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.\n\n==Application==\n\n===Sirens===\n[[File:Juli 2016 - Spoedtransport, Huisarts, Brandweer, Politie en Ambulances met spoed in Rotterdam -451.webm|start=7:14|end=8:30|{{largethumb}}|Sirens on passing emergency vehicles.]]\nThe [[siren (alarm)|siren]] on a passing [[emergency vehicle]] will start out higher than its stationary pitch, slide down as it passes, and continue lower than its stationary pitch as it recedes from the observer. Astronomer [[John Dobson (astronomer)|John Dobson]] explained the effect thus:\n\n:\"The reason the siren slides is because it doesn't hit you.\"\n\nIn other words, if the siren approached the observer directly, the pitch would remain constant, at a higher than stationary pitch, until the vehicle hit him, and then immediately jump to a new lower pitch. Because the vehicle passes by the observer, the radial velocity does not remain constant, but instead varies as a function of the angle between his line of sight and the siren's velocity:\n\n:<math>v_\\text{radial}=v_\\text{s}\\cdot \\cos{\\theta}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the object's forward velocity and the line of sight from the object to the observer.\n\n===Astronomy===\n[[Image:Redshift.svg|thumb|200px|[[Redshift]] of [[spectral line]]s in the [[optical spectrum]] of a supercluster of distant galaxies (right), as compared to that of the Sun (left)]]\n\nThe [[Relativistic Doppler effect|Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]] such as light is of great use in [[astronomy]] and results in either a so-called [[redshift]] or [[blueshift]].

Having said this, it also happens that there ''are'' detectable Doppler effects on cosmological scales, which, if incorrectly interpreted as cosmological in origin, lead to the observation of [[redshift-space distortions]].<ref> An excellent review of the topic in technical detail is given here: {{cite journal|last1=Percival|first1=Will|last2=Samushia|first2=Lado|last3=Ross|first3=Ashley|last4=Shapiro|first4=Charles|last5=Raccanelli|first5=Alvise|date= 2011 |title=Review article: Redshift-space distortions|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=369|issue=1957|pages=5058\u201367|doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0370|pmid=22084293|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/369/1957/5058.full.pdf|bibcode=2011RSPTA.369.5058P}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the Doppler effect for light in [[astronomy]] depends on our knowledge that the [[electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectra]] of stars are not homogeneous. They exhibit [[spectral line|absorption lines]] at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite [[electron]]s in various [[Chemical element|elements]] from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.\n\nAmong the [[List of nearest stars|nearby stars]], the largest radial velocities with respect to the [[Sun]] are +308&nbsp;km/s ([[BD-15\u00b04041]], also known as LHS 52, 81.7 light-years away) and \u2212260&nbsp;km/s ([[Woolley 9722]], also known as Wolf 1106 and LHS 64, 78.2 light-years away). Positive radial velocity means the star is receding from the Sun, negative that it is approaching.\n\n===Radar===\n{{Main article|Doppler radar}}\n\nThe Doppler effect is used in some types of [[radar]], to measure the velocity of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target \u2014 e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists \u2014 as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the [[proximity fuze]], developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nBecause the doppler shift affects the wave incident upon the target as well as the wave reflected back to the radar, the change in frequency observed by a radar due to a target moving at [[relative velocity]] <math>\\Delta v</math> is twice that from the same target emitting a wave:\n\n:<math>\\Delta f=\\frac{2\\Delta v}{c}f_0</math>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/11.coherent/co06.en.html|title=Radar Basics|first=Dipl.-Ing.

One of the limitations is that the [[ultrasound]] beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the [[cardiac output]].

The LDV emits a light beam and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow. The actual flow is computed as a function of the water velocity and phase. This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.\n\n===Velocity profile measurement===\nDeveloped originally for velocity measurements in medical applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure in real time complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.\n\n===Satellite communication===\nFast moving satellites can have a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed progressively during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal.<ref>{{Citation |last=Qingchong |first=Liu |title=Doppler measurement and compensation in mobile satellite communications systems |journal=Military Communications Conference Proceedings / MILCOM |volume=1 |date=1999 |pages=316\u2013320 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=822695 |doi=10.1109/milcom.1999.822695|isbn=978-0-7803-5538-5 |citeseerx=10.1.1.674.3987 }}</ref>\n\n===Audio===\nThe [[Leslie speaker]], most commonly associated with and predominantly used with the famous [[Hammond organ]], takes advantage of the Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle.

The value of \u0394T for the start of 1902 is approximately zero; for 2002 it is about 64 seconds. So the Eath's rotations over that century took about 64 seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time.\n\n==Calculating \u0394''T''==\nThe Earth's rotational speed is {{math|1=''\u03bd'' = {{sfrac|1|2\u03c0}}&thinsp;{{sfrac|''d\u03b8''|''dt''}}}}, and a day corresponds to one period {{math|1=''T'' = {{sfrac|1|''\u03bd''}}}}. A rotational acceleration {{math|{{sfrac|''d\u03bd''|''dt''}}}} gives a rate of change of the period of {{math|1={{sfrac|''dT''|''dt''}} = \u2212{{sfrac|1|''\u03bd''<sup>2</sup>}}&thinsp;{{sfrac|''d\u03bd''|''dt''}}}}, which is usually expressed as {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = ''\u03bd''&thinsp;{{sfrac|''dT''|''dt''}} = \u2212{{sfrac|1|''\u03bd''}}&thinsp;{{sfrac|''d\u03bd''|''dt''}}}}.  This has units of 1/time, and is commonly quoted as milliseconds-per-day per century (written as ms/day/cy, understood as (ms/day)/cy).\n\n===Universal time===\nUniversal Time is a time scale based on the [[Earth's rotation]], which is somewhat irregular over short periods (days up to a century), thus any time based on it cannot have an accuracy better than 1 in 10<sup>8</sup>. However, a larger, more consistent effect has been observed over many centuries: Earth's rate of rotation is inexorably slowing down.  This observed change in the rate of rotation is attributable to two primary forces, one decreasing and one increasing the Earth's rate of rotation.  Over the long term, the dominating force is [[tidal acceleration|tidal friction]], which is slowing the rate of rotation, contributing about {{math|1={{sfrac|''dT''|''dt''}} = +2.3}} ms/cy, or {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = +2.3}} ms/day/cy.  During one day, this results in a very small fractional change of {{math|1={{sfrac|\u0394''T''|''T''}} = {{val|7.3e-13}}}}.  The most important force acting in the opposite direction, to speed up the rate, is believed to be a result of the melting of continental ice sheets at the end of the [[last glacial period]].  This removed their tremendous weight, allowing the land under them to begin to rebound upward in the polar regions, an effect that is still occurring today and will continue until isostatic equilibrium is reached.  This \"[[post-glacial rebound]]\" brings mass closer to the rotational axis of the Earth, which makes the Earth spin faster, according to the law of [[angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]], similar to an ice skater pulling their arms in to spin faster. Models estimate this effect to contribute about \u22120.6&nbsp;ms/day/cy. Combining these two effects, the net acceleration (actually a deceleration) of the rotation of the Earth, or the change in the length of the mean solar day (LOD), is +1.7&nbsp;ms/day/cy.  This matches the average rate derived from astronomical records over the past 27 centuries.<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann 2009, 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial time===\nTerrestrial Time is a theoretical uniform time scale, defined to provide continuity with the former [[Ephemeris Time]] (ET).

After the invention of the telescope, measurements were made by observing occultations of stars by the [[Moon]], which allowed the derivation of more closely spaced and more accurate values for \u0394''T''. \u0394''T'' continued to decrease until it reached a plateau of +11&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;6&nbsp;s between 1680 and 1866. For about three decades immediately before 1902 it was negative, reaching \u22126.64&nbsp;s.

(The SI second as now used for UTC, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.<ref>:(1) In \"The Physical Basis of the Leap Second\", by D D McCarthy, C Hackman and R A Nelson, in ''Astronomical Journal'', vol.136 (2008), pages 1906\u20131908, it is stated (page 1908), that \"the SI second is equivalent to an older measure of the second of UT1, which was too small to start with and further, as the duration of the UT1 second increases, the discrepancy widens.\" :(2) In the late 1950s, the caesium standard was used to measure both the current mean length of the second of mean solar time (UT2) (result: 9192631830 cycles) and also the second of ephemeris time (ET) (result: 9192631770 \u00b1 20 cycles), see [http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1968-Metrologia-v4-n4-Essen.pdf \"Time Scales\", by L.

L Essen in the same 1968 article (p.162) stated that this \"seemed reasonable in view of the variations in UT2\".</ref>) Physically, the meridian of Greenwich in Universal Time is almost always to the east of the meridian in Terrestrial Time, both in the past and in the future. +17190&nbsp;s or about {{frac|4|3|4}}&nbsp;h corresponds to 71.625\u00b0E. This means that in the year \u2212500 (501&nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]]), Earth's faster rotation would cause a total solar eclipse to occur 71.625\u00b0 to the east of the location calculated using the uniform TT.\n\n==Values prior to 1955==\nAll values of \u0394''T'' before 1955 depend on observations of the Moon, either via eclipses or occultations. The angular momentum lost by the Earth due to friction induced by the Moon's tidal effect is transferred to the Moon, increasing its angular momentum, which means that its moment arm (its distance from the Earth) is increased (for the time being about +3.8&nbsp;cm/year), which via [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] causes the Moon to revolve around the Earth at a slower rate. The cited values of \u0394''T'' assume that the lunar acceleration (actually a deceleration, that is a negative acceleration) due to this effect is {{math|{{sfrac|''d'''''n'''|''dt''}}}} = \u221226\u2033/cy<sup>2</sup>, where {{math|'''n'''}} is the mean sidereal angular motion of the Moon. This is close to the best estimate for {{math|{{sfrac|''d'''''n'''|''dt''}}}} as of 2002 of \u221225.858&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;0.003\u2033/cy<sup>2</sup><ref>J.Chapront, M.Chapront-Touz\u00e9, G.Francou (2002): \"[http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2002/20/aa2201/aa2201.html A new determination of lunar orbital parameters, precession constant, and tidal acceleration from LLR measurements]\" (also [http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/20/aa2201.pdf in PDF]).

Nowadays, UT is the observed orientation of the Earth relative to an inertial reference frame formed by extra-galactic radio sources, modified by an adopted ratio between [[sidereal time]] and solar time.

''The War That Hitler Won'' p. 246.</ref> that fought in the liberation wars against [[Napoleon]], mainly as guerrilla forces. Plans to form a ''Landsturm'' national militia in eastern Germany as a last resort to boost fighting strength were first proposed in 1944 by General [[Heinz Guderian]], chief  of the General Staff.<ref>Guderian (2001) [1952]. ''Panzer Leader'', p. 362.</ref> The Army did not have enough men  to resist the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet onslaught]].

Sardonic old men would remark, \"We old monkeys are the F\u00fchrer\u2019s newest weapon\" (in German this [[rhyme]]s: \"Wir alten Affen sind des F\u00fchrers neue Waffen\"). A popular joke about the ''Volkssturm'' went \"Why is the Volkssturm Germany's most precious resource? Because its members have silver in their hair, gold in their mouths, and lead in their bones.\"<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. 36.</ref>\n\nFor these militia units to be effective, they needed not only strength in numbers, but also [[fanaticism]].<ref>Benz (2007). ''A Concise History of the Third Reich'', p. 254.</ref> During the early stages of ''Volkssturm'' planning, it became apparent that units lacking morale would lack combat effectiveness. To generate fanaticism, ''Volkssturm'' units were placed under direct command of the local Nazi party officials, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'' and ''[[Kreisleiter]]s''. The new ''Volkssturm'' was also to become a nationwide organization, with [[Heinrich Himmler]], as Replacement Army Commander, responsible for armament and training. Though nominally under party control, ''Volkssturm'' units were placed under ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' command when engaged in action. Aware that a \"people's army\" would not be able to withstand the onslaught of the modern army wielded by the Allies, Hitler issued the following order towards the end of 1944: \n::Experience in the East has shown that ''Volkssturm'', emergency and reserve units have little fighting value when left to themselves, and can be quickly destroyed. The fighting value of these units, which are for the most part strong in numbers, but weak in the armaments required for modern battle, is immeasurably higher when they go into action with troops of the regular army in the field.\n\n::I, therefore, order: where ''Volkssturm'', emergency, and reserve units are available, together with regular units, in any battle sector, mixed battle-groups (brigades) will be formed under unified command, so as to give the ''Volkssturm'', emergency, and reserve units stiffening and support.<ref>Trevor-Roper (1964). ''Blitzkrieg to Defeat'', p. 204.</ref>\n\nWith the Nazi Party in charge of organizing the ''Volkssturm'', each ''Gauleiter'', or Nazi Party District Leader, was charged with the leadership, enrollment, and organization of the ''Volkssturm'' in their district. The largest ''Volkssturm'' unit seems to have corresponded to the next smaller territorial subdivision of the Nazi Party organization\u2014the ''Kreis''. The basic unit was a [[battalion]] of 642 men. Units were mostly composed of members of the [[Hitler Youth]], invalids, the elderly, or men who had previously been considered unfit for military service.<ref name=\"Massaquoi\">[[Hans J\u00fcrgen Massaquoi]], of Liberian and German parents, had been rejected by the ''[[Jungvolk]]'' and the ''Wehrmacht'' on racial grounds, but was called by the Volkssturm.

Historian David Yelton described the situation as two ranking officers at the helm of a sinking ship fighting over command.<ref>David K. Yelton, \"The SS, NSDAP, and the Question of Volkssturm Expansion\", in Steinweis & Rogers (2003), ''The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy'', pp. 167-177.

It included a brief indoctrination and training on the use of basic weapons such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] [[rifle]] and ''[[Panzerfaust]]''. Because of continuous fighting and weapon shortages, weapon training was often minimal. There was also a lack of instructors, meaning that weapons training was sometimes done by World War I veterans drafted into service themselves. Often ''Volkssturm'' members were only able to familiarize themselves with their weapons when in actual combat.\n\nThere was no standardization of any kind and units were issued only what equipment was available. This was true of every form of equipment\u2014''Volkssturm'' members were required to bring their own uniforms and culinary equipment etc. This resulted in the units looking very ragged and, instead of boosting civilian morale, it often reminded people of Germany's desperate state.<ref name=\"Hertzstein 1986 p. 248\"/> Armament was equally haphazard: though some [[Karabiner 98k]]s were on hand, members were also issued older [[Gewehr 98]]s and 19th-century [[Mauser Model 1871|Gewehr 71s]] and [[Steyr-Mannlicher M1888]]s, as well as [[Dreyse M1907]] pistols. In addition there was a plethora of Soviet, British, Belgian, French, Italian, and other weapons that had been captured by German forces during the war. The Germans had also developed cheap but reasonably effective ''Volkssturm'' weapons, such as [[MP 3008]] machine pistols and [[Volkssturmgewehr]] rifles. These were completely stamped and machine-pressed constructions (in the 1940s, industrial processes were much cruder than today, so a firearm needed great amounts of semi-artisanal work to be actually reliable). The ''Volkssturm'' troops were nominally supplied when and where possible by both by the ''Wehrmacht'' and the SS,<ref>Duffy (2002). ''Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March on Germany, 1945'', p. 383.</ref> but oftentimes they had little to spare. Being armed with leftovers compounded the ''Volkssturm's'' ineffectiveness; the large number of different ammunition types also put a strain on an already burdened logistics system (for example, the Gewehr 71s used a different type of ammunition than the two 98 rifles).\n\nWhen units had completed their training and received armament, members took a customary [[Hitler oath|oath to Hitler]] and were then dispatched into combat. Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germany had universal military service for all young men for several generations, so many of the older members would have had at least basic military training from when they served in the [[Imperial German army|German Army]] and many would have been veterans of the [[First World War]]. ''Volkssturm'' units were supposed to be used only in their own districts, but many were sent directly to the front lines. Ultimately, it was their charge to confront the overwhelming power of the British, American, Canadian, French, Polish, and Soviet armies alongside ''Wehrmacht'' forces to either turn the tide of the war or set a shining example for future generations of Germans and expunge the defeat of 1918 by fighting to the last, dying before surrendering.<ref>Berd Wegner, \"Zweite Weltkrieg und die Choreographie des Untergangs\", ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft'', vol. xxvi (2000), no. 3, pp. 492-518. Cited in Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', p. 17.</ref> It was an apocalyptic goal which some of those assigned to the ''Volkssturm'' took to heart. Unremittingly fanatical members of the ''Volkssturm'' refused to abandon the Nazi ethos unto the dying days of the Third Reich, and in a number of instances took brutal police \"actions\" against German civilians deemed defeatists or cowards.<ref>Kershaw (2011). ''The End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nOn some occasions, members of the ''Volkssturm'' showed tremendous courage and a determined will to resist, more so even than soldiers in the ''Wehrmacht''. The ''Volkssturm'' battalion 25/235 for instance, started out with 400 men but fought on until there were only 10 men remaining. Fighting at [[K\u00fcstrin]] between 30 January to 29 March 1945, militia units made up mostly of the ''Volkssturm'' resisted for nearly two months. Losses were upwards of 60 percent for the ''Volkssturm'' at [[Kolberg]], roughly 1900 of them died at [[Breslau]], and during the [[Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg]] ([[Kaliningrad]]), another 2400 members of the ''Volkssturm'' were killed.<ref>Sorge (1986). ''The Other Price of Hitler's War: German Military and Civilian Losses Resulting from World War II'', pp. 49-50.</ref> At other times along the western front particularly, ''Volkssturm'' troops would cast their arms aside and disappear into the chaos.<ref name=\"Burleigh 2001 p. 786\"/> Youthful ardor and fanaticism among Hitler Youth members fighting with the ''Volkssturm'' or an insatiable sense of duty from old men proved tragic sometimes. An example shared by historian Stephen Fritz is instructive in this case:\n::In one representative village just north of [[Bad Windsheim]], the Herbolzheim ''Volkssturm'' unit, with its customary composition of elderly men and young boys under the influence of a few regular army soldiers, foolishly declared the town a fortress and laid mines in the streets. As American troops approached in midmorning on April 12, shots from the village rang out. Angered, the Americans commenced a two-hour artillery barrage complemented by aerial attacks that gutted the town with incendiary and high-explosive bombs. With their village engulfed in flames, the civilian inhabitants, mostly the elderly, women, and children, fled in search of shelter to the surrounding fields, all the while under American fire.<ref>Fritz (2004). ''Endkampf: Soldiers, Civilians, and the Death of the Third Reich'', p. 121.</ref>\n\nNot every ''Volkssturm'' unit was suicidal or apocalyptic in outlook as the war drew closer to its end. Many of them lost their enthusiasm for the fight when it became clear that the Allies had won, prompting them to lay down their weapons and surrender - they also feared being captured by Allied forces and tortured or executed as partisans.<ref>Moorhouse (2012). ''Berlin at War'', p. 352.</ref>  Duty to their communities and sparing their fellow Germans from atrocities like that described near Bad Windsheim also played a part in their capitulation, as did self-preservation.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', p. 22.</ref>\n\nTheir most extensive use was during the [[Battle of Berlin]], where ''Volkssturm'' units fought in many parts of the city. This battle was particularly devastating to its formations, however; many members fought to the death out of fear of being captured by the Soviets, holding out to the very end, which was in keeping with their covenant.<ref>Kissel (1962). ''Der Deutsche Volkssturm 1944/45'', p. 32.</ref> Nonetheless, a force of over 2.5 million Soviet troops, equipped with 6,250 tanks and over 40,000 artillery pieces were assigned to capture the city, and the diminished remnants of the ''Wehrmacht'' were no match for them. Meanwhile, Hitler denounced every perceived \"betrayal\" to the inhabitants of the F\u00fchrerbunker.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 104-109.</ref> Not eager to die what was thought to be a pointless death, many older members of the ''Volkssturm'' looked for places to hide from the approaching Soviet Army.<ref>Kershaw (2001). ''Hitler: 1936-1945, Nemesis'', p. 811.</ref> Juxtaposed against the tragic image of Berlin holding out against all odds was the frequent exodus and capitulation of ''Wehrmacht'' soldiers and members of the ''Volkssturm'' in southern and western Germany.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 135-137.</ref>\n\n==Battle for Berlin==\nIn the [[Battle in Berlin|Battle for Berlin]], members of the ''Volkssturm'' (mainly young boys from the ages of 13-18 and old men) were used by the German high command as a last-ditch attempt to defend Berlin. The ''Volkssturm'' had a strength of about 60,000 in the Berlin area formed into 92 battalions, of which about 30 battalions of ''Volkssturm I'' (those with some weapons) were sent to forward positions, while those of ''Volkssturm II'' (those without weapons) remained in the inner city. One of the few substantive fighting units left to defend Berlin was the LVI Panzer Corps, which occupied the southeastern sector of the town, whereas the remaining parts of the city were being defended by what remained of the SS, the ''Volkssturm'', and the Hitler Youth formations.<ref>Ziemke (1968). ''Stalingrad to Berlin: The German Defeat in the East'', p. 481.</ref>\n\nOne notable and unusual ''Volkssturm'' unit in the Battle for Berlin was the 3/115 [[Siemensstadt]] Battalion. It comprised 770 men, mainly First World War veterans in their 50s who were reasonably fit factory workers, with experienced officers. Unlike most ''Volkssturm'' units it was quite well equipped and trained. It was formed into three rifle companies, a support company (with two [[infantry support gun]]s, four infantry mortars and heavy machine guns), and a heavy weapons company (with four Soviet [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|M-20 howitzers]] and a French De Bange 220&nbsp;mm mortar). The battalion first engaged Soviet troops at [[Friedrichsfelde]] on 21 April and saw the heaviest fighting over the following two days. It held out until 2 May, by which time it was down to just 50 rifles and two light machine guns. The survivors fell back to join other ''Volkssturm'' units. 26 men from the battalion were awarded the [[Iron Cross]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Berlin battlefield guide: Third Reich & Cold War|page=212|author=Tony Le Tissier|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2008|isbn=1-84415-766-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Death was our companion: the final days of the Third Reich|page=121|author=Tony Le Tissier|publisher=Sutton|year=2003|isbn=0-7509-3363-1}}</ref> Already in rubble from Allied bombing, the final stand in Berlin dwindled to street fighting between highly trained, battle-hardened Soviet troops on the brink of final victory against the remnants of German police units, a handful of soldiers, the ''Volkssturm'', and flak helpers.<ref>Irving (1991). ''Hitler\u2019s War and the War Path'', p. 826.</ref> The chances of the ''Volkssturm'' making a major difference were never realistic in the face of the overwhelming Allied numbers and material superiority.\n\nWhile [[Iron Cross]]es were being handed out in places like Berlin, other cities and towns like [[Parchim]] and [[Mecklenburg]] witnessed old elites, acting as military commandants over the Hitler Youth and ''Volkssturm'', asserting themselves and demanding that the defensive fighting stop so as to spare lives and property.<ref>Bessel (2010). ''Germany 1945: From War to Peace'', pp. 139\u2013140.</ref> Despite their best efforts, the last four months of the war were an exercise in futility for the ''Volkssturm'', and the Nazi leadership's insistence to continue the fight to the bitter end contributed to an additional 1.23 million (approximated) deaths, half of them German military personnel and the other half from the ''Volkssturm''.<ref>Fritz (2004).

'Cut' explicitly refers to the process of [[film editing]]; in preparing a film for release, the director's cut is preceded by the assembly and rough [[editor's cut]] and usually followed by the final cut meant for the public [[film release]].\n\nDirector's cuts of film are not generally released to the public, because on most films the director does not have a [[final cut privilege]]. The production company, distributors, and/or studio (anybody with money invested in the film) can impose changes that they think will make the film profit more at the [[box office]]. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting [[Motion picture rating system|rating]], but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day.\n\nWith the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term (including things such as [[comic book]]s and music [[albums]], neither of which actually have directors), and the most commonly seen form of director's cut is a cut where [[Deleted scene|extra scenes]] and characters are added in, often making the director's cut considerably longer than the final cut.\n\n== Origin of the phrase ==\nTraditionally, the \"director's cut\" is not, by definition, the director's ideal or preferred cut. The [[Film editing|editing process of a film]] is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the [[editor's cut]] is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by his own tastes or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]], which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor's cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director's cut. The director's cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up shots]] etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos.\n\n== Inception ==\nThe trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the \"director's cut\" of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Ellen|title=Is a 'director's cut' ever a good idea?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/07/rise-of-the-directors-cut |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> The theatrical release of the film had cut ten minutes to get an R-rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include [[George Lucas]]'s first two films being re-released following the success of ''[[Star Wars]]'', in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or [[Peter Bogdanovich]] re-cutting ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' several times.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin's re-release of ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director's re-cut film being released to the public).  A theatrical re-release of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' used the phrase \"Special Edition\" to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg's intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio.  As the [[home video]] industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director's cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated [[cult following|cult fan]] market. Los Angeles [[Cable television|cable]] station [[Z Channel]] is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts.  Early examples of films released in this manner include [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', where a longer cut was recalled from theaters but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[The Abyss]]'', where Cameron voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version for pacing but restored them for a video release; [[Shim Hyung-rae]]'s ''[[Yonggary (1999 film)|Yonggary]]'', where Shim made cuts to the theatrical version for how close to the American ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' it was and added in aliens and another monster, Cyker. That version was released stateside as ''Reptilian'' and, most famously, [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'', where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut, the first film to use the term \"Director's Cut\" as a marketing description (and the first time it was used to describe a cut that the director was not involved in preparing).\n\n== Criticism ==\nOnce distributors discovered that consumers would buy alternate versions of films, it became common for films to receive multiple releases. There is no standardization for labelling, leading to so-called \"director's cuts\" of films despite where the director prefers the theatrically released version, or when the director had actual final cut privilege. These were often assembled by simply restoring deleted scenes, sometimes adding as much as a half-hour to the length of the film without regard to pacing and storytelling.\n\nAs a result, the \"director's cut\" is often considered a mixed bag, with an equal share of supporters and detractors. [[Roger Ebert]] approved of the use of the label in unsuccessful films that had been tampered with by studio executives, such as [[Sergio Leone]]'s original cut of ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'',<ref name=\"rebertonceupon\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Once Upon a Time in America|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/once-upon-a-time-in-america-1984|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=16 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502002533/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/once-upon-a-time-in-america-1984 |archivedate=2 May 2013|date=1 January 1984}}</ref> and the moderately successful theatrical version of ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'',{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} which were altered by studio interference for their theatrical release. Other well-received director's cuts include [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' (with ''Empire'' magazine stating: \"The added 45 minutes in the Director\u2019s Cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle\"<ref name=\"Kingdom\">{{cite news|title=Directors Cuts, the Good, the Bad, and the Unnecessary|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/special-editions-good-bad-unnecessary/|publisher=Empire|date=10 January 2015}}</ref>), or [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', where the restored 115 minute cut is closer to the director's intent than the theatrical 105 minute cut (the actual director's cut was 122 minutes; it was never completed to Peckinpah's satisfaction, but was used as a guide for the restoration that was done after his death).\n\nHowever, Ebert considers adding such material to a successful film a waste.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Even Ridley Scott stated on the director's commentary track of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' that the original theatrical release was his director's cut, and that the new version was released as a marketing ploy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambie|first1=Ryan|title=The changing face of the director\u2019s cut|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/21732/the-changing-face-of-the-director%E2%80%99s-cut}}</ref> Director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], no stranger to director's cuts himself, cites ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' as an example where \"MGM have a version of Howard Hawks's ''Red River'' that they're calling the Director's Cut and it is absolutely not the director's cut. It's a cut the director didn't want, an earlier cut that was junked. They assume because it was longer that it's a director's cut. Capra cut two reels off ''Lost Horizon'' because it didn't work and then someone tried to put it back. There are certainly mistakes and stupidities in reconstructing pictures.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Ellen|title=Is a 'director's cut' ever a good idea?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/07/rise-of-the-directors-cut}}</ref>\n\nIn rare instances, such as [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[John Cassavetes]]'s ''[[The Killing of a Chinese Bookie]]'', and [[Blake Edwards]]'s ''[[Darling Lili]]'', changes made to a director's cut result in a shorter, more compact cut. This generally happens when a distributor insists that a film be completed in order to meet a release date, but sometimes it is the result of removing scenes that the distributor insisted on inserting, as opposed to restoring scenes they insisted on cutting.\n\nAnother way that released director's cuts can be compromised is when directors were never allowed to even shoot their vision, and thus when the film is re-cut, they must make do with the footage that exists. Examples of this include [[Terry Zwigoff]]'s ''[[Bad Santa]]'', [[Brian Helgeland]]'s ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'', and most notably the [[Richard Donner]] re-cut of ''[[Superman II]]''. Donner completed about 75% of the shooting of the sequel during the shooting of the first one but was fired from the project. His director's cut of the film includes, among other things, screen test footage of stars [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Margot Kidder]], footage used in the first film, and entire scenes that were shot by replacement director [[Richard Lester]] which Donner dislikes but were required for story purposes.\n\n== Extended cuts and special editions ==\nSome directors explicitly dislike the phrase \"director's cut\" because it implies that they disapprove of the theatrically released cut. [[James Cameron]] and [[Peter Jackson]] are two directors who publicly reject the label, preferring \"extended edition\" or \"special edition\". While Jackson considers the theatrical releases of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' trilogies to be a final \"director's cut\" within the constraints of theatrical exhibition, the extended cuts were produced so that fans of the material could see nearly all of the scenes shot for the script to develop more of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world, but which were originally cut for running time, or other reasons. New music and special effects were also added to the cuts. Cameron specified \"what I put into theaters is the Director's cut. Nothing was cut that I didn't want cut. All the extra scenes we've added back in are just a bonus for the fans.\" (Though referring specifically to ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', he has expressed similar feelings on all of his films besides ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]''.)\n\nSpecial editions such as [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', in which special effects are redone in addition to a new edit, have also caused controversy. (''See '' [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases]] and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial#20th anniversary version|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial: The 20th Anniversary]]'').\n\nExtended or special editions can also apply to films that have been extended for television to fill time slots, against the explicit wishes of the director, such as the TV versions of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979), ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' (1978) and the ''[[Harry Potter (films)|Harry Potter]]'' films.\n\nThe film ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' exists in at least 10 different officially released versions, ranging from a sub-90 minute television edit version of TV-14 (later TVMA) for cable television to an unrated full pornographic version exceeding 3.5 hours. This is believed to be the most distinct versions of a single film. Among major studio films, the record is believed to be held by ''[[Blade Runner]]''; the magazine [[Video Watchdog]] counted no less than seven distinct versions in a 1993 issue, before director Ridley Scott later released a \"Final Cut\" in 2007, bringing the supposed grand total to eight differing versions.\n\n== Music video director's cut ==\nThe music video for the 2006 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated song \"[[Listen (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Listen]]\", performed by [[Beyonc\u00e9]], received a director's cut by [[Diane Martel]]. This version of the video was later included on Knowles' ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'' (2007). [[Linkin Park]] has a director's cut version for their music video \"[[Faint (song)|Faint]]\" (directed by [[Mark Romanek]]) in which one of the band members spray paints the words \"En Proceso\" on a wall, as well as Hoobastank also having one for 2004's \"The Reason\" which omits the woman getting hit by the car. [[Britney Spears]]' music video for 2007's \"[[Gimme More]]\" was first released as a director's cut on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], with the official video released 3 days later. Many other director's cut music videos contain [[sexual content]] that can't be shown on TV thus creating alternative scenes, such as [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]]'s \"[[Hurricane (Thirty Seconds to Mars song)|Hurricane]]\", and in some cases, alternative videos, such as in the case of Spears' [[2008 in music|2008]] video for \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\".\n\n== Expanded usage in pop culture ==\nAs the trend became more widely recognized, the term \"director's cut\" became increasingly used as a [[colloquialism]] to refer to an expanded version of other things, including video games, music, and comic books.  This confusing usage only served to further reduce the artistic value of a \"director's cut\", and it is currently rarely used in those ways.\n\n=== Video games ===\nFor video games, these expanded versions, also referred as \"complete editions\", will have additions to the gameplay or additional game modes and features outside the main portion of the game. \n\nAs is the case with certain high-profile Japanese-produced games, the game designers may take the liberty to revise their product for the overseas market with additional features during the [[software localization|localization]] process. These features are later added back to the native market in a re-release of a game in what is often referred as the [[international version]] of the game. This was the case with the overseas versions of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' and ''[[Rogue Galaxy]]'', which contained additional features (such as new difficulty settings for ''Metal Gear Solid''), resulting in re-released versions of those respective games in [[Japan]] (''[[Final Fantasy VII#Development|Final Fantasy VII International]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid#Integral and VR Missions|Metal Gear Solid: Integral]]'' and ''[[Rogue Galaxy#Localization Improvements|Rogue Galaxy: Director's Cut]]''). In the case of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'', the American versions were released first, followed by the Japanese versions and then the European versions, with each regional release offering new content not found in the previous one. All of the added content from the Japanese and European versions of those games were included in the expanded editions titled ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty#Substance|Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater#Subsistence|Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence]]''.\n\nThey also, similar to movies, will occasionally include extra, uncensored or alternate versions of cutscenes, as was the case with ''[[Resident Evil: Code Veronica X]]''. In markets with strict censorship, a later relaxing of those laws occasional will result in the game being rereleased with the \"Special/Uncut Edition\" tag added to differentiate between the originally released censored version and the current uncensored edition.\n\nSeveral of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games have also received director's cuts and have used the term \"extension,\" though \"remake\" and \"third version\" are also often used by many fans. These include ''[[Pocket Monsters: Blue]]'' (Japan only), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'' (for ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Green''/''Blue''), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'' (for [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'' (for [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]), ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'' (for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]''), and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]]''\n\n=== Music \"director's cuts\" ===\n\"Director's cuts\" in [[music]] are rarely released. A few exceptions include [[Guided by Voices]]' 1994 [[album]] ''[[Bee Thousand]]'', which was [[re-released]] as a three disc [[vinyl LP]] Director's cut in 2004, and [[Fall Out Boy]]'s 2003 album ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'', which was re-released as a Director's cut in 2005 with two extra [[song|tracks]].\n\nIn 2011 British singer [[Kate Bush]] released the album titled ''[[Director's Cut (Kate Bush album)|Director's Cut]]''. It is made up of songs from her earlier albums ''[[The Sensual World]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' which have been remixed and restructured, three of which were re-recorded completely.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Film modification]]\n* [[Final cut privilege]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mediacircus.net/dc.html \"Director's Cuts: Do They Make the Cut?\"] Article from Frontier magazine.\n* [http://www.movie-censorship.com/ Movie-Censorship.com] More than 1000 comparisons of different versions of films.\n* [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/column/sfw17153.html \"Do Filmgoers Dream of Director's Cuts?\"] SciFi.com article detailing the cuts of ''[[Blade Runner]]''.\n* [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19981204&id=OelWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ROwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5295,1605791&hl=en If Movie Seems Too Long, Blame It On The Director]\n\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Film production]]", "sha1": "9edzv6kdx4q2z66ekjp2qy65lzshnbe"}}, {"title": "Digital video", "ns": "0", "id": "8733", "revision": {"id": "863185878", "parentid": "863114742", "timestamp": "2018-10-09T06:33:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "J.

This is in contrast to [[analog video]], which represents moving visual images with [[analog signal]]s. Digital video comprises a series of [[digital image]]s displayed in rapid succession.\n\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the [[D1 (Sony)|Sony D1]] format{{cn|date=June 2018}}, which recorded an uncompressed [[standard definition]] [[component video]] signal in digital form. In addition to uncompressed formats, popular [[Data compression|compressed]] digital video formats today include [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-4]]. Modern interconnect standards for digital video include [[HDMI]], [[DisplayPort]], [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) and [[serial digital interface]] (SDI).\n\nDigital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. In contrast, when analog sources are copied, they experience [[generation loss]]. Digital video can be stored on digital media such as [[Blu-ray Disc]], on [[computer data storage]] or [[streaming video|streamed]] over the [[Internet]] to [[end user]]s who watch content on a [[desktop computer]] screen or a digital [[smart TV]]. In everyday practice, digital video content such as [[TV show]]s and [[movie]]s also includes a [[digital audio]] soundtrack.\n\n==History==\nStarting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of [[video production]] equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced. These included [[time base corrector]]s (TBC){{efn|For example the [[Thomson-CSF]] 9100 Digital Video Processor, an internally all-digital full-frame TBC introduced in 1980.}} and [[digital video effects]] (DVE) units.{{efn|For example the [[Ampex]] ADO, and the [[Nippon Electric Corporation]] (NEC) DVE.}} They operated by taking a standard analog [[composite video]] input and digitizing it internally. This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.\n\nLater on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] (through their [[Fernseh]] division) and [[Ampex]] developed prototype digital [[videotape recorder]]s (VTR) in their research and development labs. Bosch's machine used a modified [[1 inch type B videotape]] transport, and recorded an early form of [[CCIR 601]] digital video. Ampex's prototype digital video recorder used a modified [[2 inch Quadruplex videotape]] VTR (an Ampex AVR-3), but fitted with custom digital video electronics, and a special \"octaplex\" 8-head headwheel (regular analog 2\" Quad machines only used 4 heads). Like standard 2\" Quad, the audio on the Ampex prototype digital machine, nicknamed by its developers as \"Annie\", still recorded the audio in analog as linear tracks on the tape. None of these machines from these manufacturers were ever marketed commercially.\n\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony [[D-1 (Sony)|D1]] format, which recorded an uncompressed [[standard definition]] [[component video]] signal in digital form. Component video connections required 3 cables and most [[television]] facilities were wired for composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable. Due this incompatibility and also due to the cost of the recorder, D1 was used primarily by large [[television network]]s and other component-video capable video studios.\n\nIn 1988, Sony and Ampex co-developed and released the [[D-2 (video)|D2]] digital videocassette format, which recorded video digitally without compression in [[ITU-601]] format, much like D1. But D2 had the major difference of encoding the video in composite form to the NTSC standard, thereby only requiring single-cable composite video connections to and from a D2 VCR, making it a perfect fit for the majority of television facilities at the time. D2 was a successful format in the [[television broadcast]] industry throughout the late '80s and the '90s. D2 was also widely used in that era as the master tape format for mastering [[laserdiscs]].{{efn|Prior to D2, most laserdiscs were mastered using analog [[1\" Type C videotape]]}}\n\nD1 & D2 would eventually be replaced by cheaper systems using [[video compression]], most notably Sony's [[Digital Betacam]]{{efn|Digital Betacam is still heavily used as an [[electronic field production]] (EFP) recording format by professional television producers}} that were introduced into the network's [[television studio]]s. Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's [[DCT (videocassette format)|DCT]] (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard [[DV]] and MiniDV and its professional variations, Sony's [[DVCAM]] and Panasonic's [[DVCPRO]], and [[Betacam SX]], a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using [[MPEG-2]] compression.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nOne of the first digital video products to run on personal computers was ''PACo: The PICS Animation Compiler'' from The Company of Science & Art in Providence, RI, which was developed starting in 1990 and first shipped in May 1991. PACo could stream unlimited-length video with synchronized sound from a single file (with the \".CAV\" [[file extension]]) on CD-ROM. Creation required a Mac; playback was possible on Macs, PCs, and Sun [[SPARCstation]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=CoSA Lives: The Story of the Company Behind After Effects |url=http://www.motionworks.com.au/2009/11/cosa-lives/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227132422/http://motionworks.com.au/2009/11/cosa-lives/ |archive-date=2011-02-27 |access-date=2009-11-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n[[QuickTime]], [[Apple Computer]]'s architecture for time-based and streaming data formats appeared in June 1991. Initial consumer-level content creation tools were crude, requiring an analog video source to be digitized to a computer-readable format. While low-quality at first, consumer digital video increased rapidly in quality, first with the introduction of playback standards such as [[MPEG-1]] and [[MPEG-2]] (adopted for use in television transmission and [[DVD]] media), and then the introduction of the [[DV]] tape format allowing recordings in the format to be transferred direct to digital video files (containing the same video data recorded on the transferred DV tape) on an editing computer and simplifying the editing process, allowing [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) to be deployed cheaply and widely on [[desktop computer]]s with no external playback/recording equipment needed, save for the computer simply requiring a [[FireWire]] port to interface to the DV-format camera or VCR. The widespread adoption of digital video has also drastically reduced the bandwidth needed for a [[high-definition video]] signal (with [[HDV]] and [[AVCHD]], as well as several commercial variants such as [[DVCPRO]]-HD, all using less bandwidth than a standard definition analog signal) and [[tapeless camcorder]]s based on [[flash memory]] and often a variant of [[MPEG-4]].\n\n==Overview ==\n\nDigital video comprises a series of orthogonal bitmap [[digital image]]s displayed in rapid succession at a constant rate. In the context of video these images are called '''[[film frame|frames]]'''.<ref>In fact the still images correspond to frames only in the case of progressive scan video. In interlaced video they correspond to fields. See section about interlacing for clarification</ref>  The rate at which frames are displayed in is measured in '''frames per second (FPS)'''. Since every frame is an orthogonal bitmap digital image it comprises a raster of '''[[pixel]]s'''. If it has a width of '''W''' pixels and a height of '''H''' pixels it is said that the '''frame size''' is W''x''H. Pixels have only one property, their color. The color of a pixel is represented by a fixed number of bits. The more bits the more subtle variations of colors can be reproduced. This is called the '''[[color depth|color depth (CD)]]''' of the video.\n\nAn example video can have a '''duration (T)''' of 1 hour (3600''sec''), a frame size of 640x480 ''(WxH)'' at a color depth of 24 ''bits'' and a frame rate of 25''fps''. This example video has the following properties:\n* '''pixels per frame''' = 640 * 480 = 307,200\n* '''bits per frame''' = 307,200 * 24 = 7,372,800 = 7.37 ''Mbits''\n* '''bit rate (BR)''' = 7.37 * 25 = 184.25 '''''Mbits/sec'''''\n* '''video size (VS)'''<ref>the term ''video size'' is used instead of just ''size'' in order to avoid confusion with the ''frame size''</ref> = 184 ''Mbits/sec'' * 3600 ''sec'' = 662,400 ''Mbits'' = 82,800 ''Mbytes'' = 82.8 '''''Gbytes'''''\n\nThe most important properties are ''bit rate'' and ''video size''. The formulas relating those two with all other properties are:\n\n BR = W * H * CD * FPS\n VS = BR * T = W * H * CD * FPS * T\n (units are: BR in bit/s, W and H in pixels, CD in bits, VS in bits, T in seconds)\n\nwhile some secondary formulas are:\n ''pixels_per_frame'' = W * H\n ''pixels_per_second'' = W * H * FPS\n ''bits_per_frame'' = W * H * CD\n\n===Interlacing===\nIn interlaced video each ''frame'' is composed of two ''halves of an image''. The first half contains only the odd-numbered lines of a full frame. The second half contains only the even-numbered lines. Those halves are referred to individually as ''fields''. Two consecutive fields compose a full frame. If an interlaced video has a frame rate of 15 frames per second the field rate is 30 fields per second. All the properties and formulas discussed here apply equally to interlaced video but one should be careful not to confuse the fields per second rate with the frames per second rate.\n\n===Properties of compressed video===\nThe above are accurate for [[uncompressed video]]. Because of the relatively high bit rate of uncompressed video, [[video compression]] is extensively used. In the case of compressed video each frame requires a small percentage of the original bits. Assuming a [[compression algorithm]] that shrinks the input data by a factor of '''CF''', the bit rate and video size would equal to:\n\n BR = W * H * CD * FPS / CF\n VS = BR * T / CF\n\nNote that it is not necessary that all frames are equally compressed by a factor of CF. In practice they are not, so CF is the ''average'' factor of compression for ''all'' the frames taken together.\n\nThe above equation for the bit rate can be rewritten by combining the compression factor and the color depth like this:\n\n BR = W * H * ( CD / CF ) * FPS\n\nThe value '''(CD / CF)''' represents the '''average bits per pixel (BPP)'''. As an example, if there is a color depth of 12 bits/pixel and an algorithm that compresses at 40x, then BPP equals 0.3 (12/40). So in the case of compressed video the formula for bit rate is:\n\n BR = W * H * BPP * FPS\n\nThe same formula is valid for uncompressed video because in that case one can assume that the \"compression\" factor is 1 and that the average bits per pixel equal the color depth.\n\n===Bit rate and BPP===\nBy its definition, [[bit rate]] is a measure of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, bit rate corresponds directly to the quality of the video. (Bit rate is proportional to every property that affects the [[video quality]].) Bit rate is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that bit rate. Bit rate is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the bit rate and the duration. Bit rate of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications. [[Video compression]] is used to greatly reduce the bit rate. BPP is a measure of the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. [[Chroma subsampling]] can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying [[jpeg]] compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like [[MPEG1]], [[MPEG2]] or [[MPEG4]] allows for fractional BPP values.\n\n====Constant bit rate versus variable bit rate====\nAs noted above, BPP represents the ''average'' bits per pixel. There are compression algorithms that keep the BPP almost constant throughout the entire duration of the video. In this case, we also get video output with a [[Constant bitrate|constant bit rate (CBR)]]. This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). As not all frames can be compressed at the same level, because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity, some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep it high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way, one gets the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size, accordingly). When using this method, the [[Variable Bit Rate|bit rate is variable]] because it tracks the variations of the BPP.\n\n==Technical overview==\n\nStandard [[film stock]]s such as [[16 mm film|16 mm]] and [[35 mm film|35 mm]] record at 24 [[frame rate|frames per second]]. For video, there are two frame rate standards: [[NTSC]], which shoot at 30/1.001 (about 29.97) frames per second or 59.94 fields per second, and [[PAL]], 25 frames per second or 50 fields per second. Digital video cameras come in two different image capture formats: [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d and deinterlaced / [[progressive scan]]. Interlaced cameras record the image in alternating sets of lines: the odd-numbered lines are scanned, and then the even-numbered lines are scanned, then the odd-numbered lines are scanned again, and so on. One set of odd or even lines is referred to as a \"field\", and a consecutive pairing of two fields of opposite parity is called a ''frame''. Deinterlaced cameras records each frame as distinct, with all scan lines being captured at the same moment in time. Thus, interlaced video captures samples the scene motion twice as often as progressive video does, for the same number of [[frame rate|frames per second]]. Progressive-scan camcorders generally produce a slightly sharper image. However, motion may not be as smooth as interlaced video which uses 50 or 59.94 fields per second, particularly if they employ the 24 frames per second standard of film.\n\nDigital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. No matter how many generations of a digital source is copied, it will still be as clear as the original first generation of digital footage. However a change in parameters like frame size as well as a change of the digital format can decrease the quality of the video due to new calculations that have to be made. Digital video can be manipulated and edited to follow an order or sequence on an NLE, or [[non-linear editing]] workstation, a computer-based device intended to edit video and [[sound recording|audio]]. More and more, videos are edited on readily available, increasingly affordable consumer-grade computer hardware and software. However, such editing systems require ample disk space for video footage. The many video formats and parameters to be set make it quite impossible to come up with a specific number for how many minutes need how much time.\n\nDigital video has a significantly lower cost than 35&nbsp;mm film. In comparison to the high cost of [[film stock]], the tape stock (or other electronic media used for digital video recording, such as [[flash memory]] or [[hard disk drive]]) used for recording digital video is very inexpensive. Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive chemical processing required by film. Also physical deliveries of tapes and broadcasts do not apply anymore. [[Digital television]] (including higher quality [[High Definition Television|HDTV]]) started to spread in most developed countries in early 2000s. Digital video is also used in modern [[mobile phone]]s and [[Video teleconference|video conferencing]] systems. Digital video is also used for [[Internet]] distribution of media, including [[streaming video]] and [[peer-to-peer]] movie distribution. However even within Europe are lots of TV-Stations not broadcasting in HD, due to restricted budgets for new equipment for processing HD.\n\nMany types of [[video compression]] exist for serving digital video over the internet and on optical disks. The file sizes of digital video used for professional editing are generally not practical for these purposes, and the video requires further compression with codecs such as Sorenson, H.264 and more recently Apple ProRes especially for HD. Probably the most widely used formats for delivering video over the internet are MPEG4, Quicktime, Flash and Windows Media, while MPEG2 is used almost exclusively for DVDs, providing an exceptional image in minimal size but resulting in a high level of CPU consumption to decompress.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, the highest resolution demonstrated for digital video generation is 35 [[megapixel]]s (8192 x 4320). The highest speed is attained in industrial and scientific [[high speed camera]]s that are capable of filming 1024x1024 video at up to 1 million frames per second for brief periods of recording.\n\n==Interfaces and cables==\n\nMany interfaces have been designed specifically to handle the requirements of uncompressed digital video (from roughly 400 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s):\n\n*[[HDMI|High-Definition Multimedia Interface]]\n*[[Digital Visual Interface]]\n*[[Serial Digital Interface]]\n*[[DisplayPort]]\n*[[Digital component video]]\n*[[Unified Display Interface]]\n*[[IEEE 1394|FireWire]]\n*[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]\n\nThe following interface has been designed for carrying [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]]-Transport compressed video:\n* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-[[Asynchronous serial communication|ASI]]\nCompressed video is also carried using [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]-[[Internet Protocol|IP]] over [[Ethernet]]. Two approaches exist for this:\n* Using [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] as a wrapper for video packets\n* 1-7 [[MPEG transport stream|MPEG Transport Packets]] are placed directly in the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] packet\n\nAlternative methods of carrying video over IP include:\n* [[Network Device Interface]]\n\n==Storage formats==\n\n===Encoding===\nAll current formats, which are listed below, are [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] based.\n*[[CCIR 601]] used for broadcast stations\n*[[MPEG-4]] good for online distribution of large videos and video recorded to [[flash memory]]\n*[[MPEG-2]] used for DVDs, Super-VCDs, and many broadcast television formats\n*[[MPEG-1]] used for video CDs\n*[[H.261]]\n*[[H.263]]\n*[[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] also known as ''MPEG-4 Part 10'', or as ''AVC'', used for [[Blu-ray Disc]]s and some broadcast television formats\n*[[Theora]] used for video on Wikipedia\n\n===Tapes===\n{{main|Video tape}}\n* [[Betacam|Betacam SX]], [[Betacam IMX]], [[Digital Betacam]], or DigiBeta \u2014 Commercial video systems by [[Sony]], based on original [[Betamax]] technology\n* [[D-VHS]] \u2014 MPEG-2 format data recorded on a tape similar to [[S-VHS]]\n* [[D1 (Sony)|D1]], [[D2 (video format)|D2]], [[D3 (video)|D3]], [[D5 HD|D5]], [[D9 (video)|D9]] (also known as Digital-S) \u2014 various [[SMPTE]] commercial digital video standards\n* [[Digital8]] \u2014 DV-format data recorded on [[Hi8]]-compatible cassettes;

The software consists, most prominently, of the DNS server component, called ''named'', a contracted form of ''name [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]''. In addition the suite contains various administration tools, and a DNS resolver interface library. The latest version of BIND is BIND 9, first released in 2000. BIND 9 is actively maintained, with new releases issued several times a year.\n\nStarting in 2009, the [[Internet Software Consortium]] (ISC) developed a new software suite, initially called BIND10. With release version 1.2.0 the project was renamed ''Bundy'' to terminate ISC involvement in the project.\n\n==Key Features==\nBIND 9 is intended to be fully compliant with the [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/documents/ IETF DNS standards and draft standards].  Important features of BIND 9 include: [[TSIG]], [[nsupdate]], [[IPv6]], rndc (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), [[Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions|DNSSEC]], and broad portability.  rndc enables remote configuration updates, using a [[shared secret]] to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session. \n\n==Database support==\nWhile earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve [[Zone file|zone data in anything other than flat text files]], in 2007 BIND 9.4<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/bind-announce/2007-February/000210.html\n| title=BIND 9.4.0 is now available.\n| author=Mark Andrews\n| date=2007-02-24\n| accessdate=2015-09-17}}</ref> [http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/ DLZ] provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including [[LDAP]], [[Berkeley DB]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], and [[ODBC]]. \n\nBIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.<ref name=\"bind10-design\">{{cite web\n| url=https://kea.isc.org/wiki/DesignOverview\n| title=Kea: Design overview\n| publisher=ISC\n| accessdate=2015-09-17}}</ref>\nIn 2016 ISC added support for the 'dyndb' interface, contributed by RedHat, with BIND version 9.11.0. <ref>https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01420/219/What-is-dyndb-and-how-is-it-better-than-DLZ.html</ref>\n\n==Security==\nSecurity issues that are discovered in BIND 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software.

[[Paul Vixie]] started maintaining it in 1988 while working for [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. {{As of | 2012}}, the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] maintains, updates, and writes new versions of BIND.\n\nBIND was written by Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou in the early 1980s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a result of a [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] grant. The acronym ''BIND'' is for ''Berkeley Internet Name Domain'', from a technical paper published in 1984.<ref name=\"Terry\"/>\n\nVersions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web\n| url=https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/history-of-bind/\n| title=History of BIND\n| author=ISC\n| date=2016-10-31\n| accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Paul Vixie of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] took over BIND development, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1. [[Paul Vixie]] continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC.  BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises.

The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft's DNS offerings;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the [[DNSSEC]] features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important.  BIND 9 was released in September 2000.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] DHCP server components.

For example, zone transfers, zone file parsing, [[DNS cache|caching]], and [[recursion|recursive]] resolving are implemented as separate programs.  The result of these design decisions is a reduction in code size and complexity of the [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] program that provides the core function of answering lookup requests.

It was created in the early 1990s by a group led by [[Apple Computer]].\n\nA concise and thorough overview of the language may be found in the Dylan Reference Manual.<ref name=\"refman\"/>\n\nDylan derives from [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]] and adds an integrated object system derived from the [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS). In Dylan, all values (including numbers, characters, functions, and [[Class (computer programming)|classes]]) are [[first-class object]]s. Dylan supports [[multiple inheritance]], [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[multiple dispatch]], [[keyword argument]]s, object introspection, [[Pattern matching|pattern]]-based [[Syntactic macro|syntax extension macro]]s, and many other advanced features. Programs can express fine-grained control over dynamism, admitting programs that occupy a continuum between dynamic and static programming and supporting evolutionary development (allowing for rapid prototyping followed by incremental refinement and optimization).\n\nDylan's main design goal is to be a dynamic language well-suited for developing [[commercial software]]. Dylan attempts to address potential performance issues by introducing \"natural\" limits to the full flexibility of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] systems, allowing the [[compiler]] to clearly understand compilable units, such as [[Library (computing)|libraries]].\n\nDylan derives much of its semantics from Scheme and other Lisps; some Dylan implementations were initially built within extant Lisp systems. However, Dylan has an [[ALGOL]]-like syntax instead of a Lisp-like prefix syntax.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of the Dylan programming language}}\n\nDylan was created in the early 1990s by a group led by [[Apple Computer]]. At one time in its development, it was intended for use with the [[Apple Newton]] computer, but the Dylan implementation did not reach sufficient maturity in time, and Newton instead used a mix of C and the [[NewtonScript]] developed by Walter Smith. Apple ended their Dylan development effort in 1995, though they made a \"technology release\" version available (Apple Dylan TR1) that included an advanced [[integrated development environment]] (IDE).\n\nTwo other groups contributed to the design of the language and developed implementations: [[Harlequin (software company)|Harlequin]] released a commercial IDE for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] released an [[open source]] compiler for [[Unix]] systems called Gwydion Dylan. Both of these implementations are now open source. The Harlequin implementation is now named Open Dylan and is maintained by a group of volunteers, the Dylan Hackers.\n\nThe Dylan language was code-named Ralph. James Joaquin chose the name Dylan for \"DYnamic LANguage.\"\n\n==Syntax==\nDylan uses an ALGOL-like syntax designed by Michael Kahl.  It is described in great detail in the Dylan Reference Manual.<ref name=\"refman\"/>  This page shows examples of some syntax features that are more unusual.  Many of them come from Dylan's Lisp heritage.\n\nA simple class with several slots:\n\n<source lang=\"dylan\">\ndefine class <point> (<object>)\n  slot point-x :: <integer>,\n    required-init-keyword: x:;\n  slot point-y :: <integer>,\n    required-init-keyword: y:;\nend class <point>;\n</source>\n* By convention all classes are named with angle brackets.  This is just a convention.  The class could be named \"Point\", but that is never done.  (Note that Dylan is not case sensitive.)\n* In <code>end class &lt;point&gt;</code> both <code>class</code> and <code>&lt;point&gt;</code> are optional.  This is true for all <code>end</code> clauses.  For example, you may write <code>end if</code> or just <code>end</code> to terminate an <code>if</code> statement.\n\nThe same class, rewritten in the most minimal way possible:\n\n<source lang=\"dylan\">\ndefine class <point> (<object>)\n  slot point-x;\n  slot point-y;\nend;\n</source>\n\n* The slots are now both typed as <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>.\n* The slots must be initialized manually.\n\n<source lang=\"dylan\">\ndefine constant $pi :: <double-float> = 3.1415927d0;\n</source>\n* By convention constant names begin with \"$\".\n\nA factorial function:\n<source lang=\"dylan\">\ndefine function factorial (n :: <integer>) => (n! :: <integer>)\n  case\n    n < 0     => error(\"Can't take factorial of negative integer: %d\\n\", n);\n    n = 0     => 1;\n    otherwise => n * factorial(n - 1);\n  end\nend;\n</source>\n* There is no explicit <code>return</code> statement.  The result of a method or function is the last expression evaluated.  It is a common style to leave off the semicolon after an expression in return position.\n* Identifiers in Dylan may contain more \"special\" characters than most language. <code>n!</code> and <code>&lt;integer&gt;</code> are just normal identifiers.  If there is any ambiguity, whitespace is used.\n* Statements such as <code>if</code> and <code>for</code> end with the keyword <code>end</code> but may optionally be written as <code>end if</code> or <code>end for</code>.\n\nOriginally, Dylan used a Lisp-like prefix syntax, which is based on [[s-expression]]s:\n\n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n (bind ((radius 5)\n        (circumference (* 2 $pi radius)))\n   (if (> circumference 42)\n       (format-out \"Hello big circle! c is %=\" circumference)\n       (format-out \"Hello circle! c is %=\" circumference)))\n</source>\n\nBy the time the language design was completed, it was changed to an ALGOL-like syntax, with the expectation that it would be more familiar to a wider audience of programmers.\n\n==Modules vs. namespace==\nIn many object-oriented languages, classes are the main means of encapsulation and modularity; each class defines a namespace and controls which definitions are externally visible. Further, classes in many languages define an indivisible unit that must be used as a whole. For example, using a <code>String</code> concatenation function requires importing and compiling against all of <code>String</code>.\n\nSome languages, including Dylan, also include a separate, explicit namespace or module system that performs encapsulation in a more general way.\n\nIn Dylan, the concepts of compile-unit and import-unit are separated, and classes have nothing specifically to do with either. A ''library'' defines items that should be compiled and handled together, while a ''module'' defines the namespace. Classes can be placed together in modules, or cut across them, as the programmer wishes. Often the complete definition for a class does not exist in a single module, but is spread across several that are optionally collected together. Different programs can have different definitions of the same class, including only what they need.\n\nFor example, consider an add-on library for [[regex]] support on <code>String</code>. In some languages, for the functionality to be included in strings, the functionality must be added to the <code>String</code> namespace. As soon as this occurs, the <code>String</code> class becomes larger, and functions that don't need to use regex still must \"pay\" for it in increased library size. For this reason, these sorts of add-ons are typically placed in their own namespaces and objects. The downside to this approach is that the new functions are no longer a ''part of'' <code>String</code>; instead, it is isolated in its own set of functions that must be called separately. Instead of <code>myString.parseWith(myPattern)</code>, which would be the natural organization from an OO viewpoint,  something like <code>myPattern.parseString(myString)</code> is used, which effectively reverses the ordering.\n\nUnder Dylan, many interfaces can be defined for the same code, for instance the String concatenation method could be placed in both the String interface, and the \"concat\" interface which collects together all of the different concatenation functions from various classes. This is more commonly used in math libraries, where functions tend to be applicable to widely differing object types.\n\nA more practical use of the interface construct is to build public and private versions of a module, something that other languages include as a ''bolt on'' feature that invariably causes problems and adds syntax. Under Dylan, every function call can be simply places in the \"Private\" or \"Development\" interface, and collect up publicly accessible functions in <code>Public</code>. Under [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C++]] the visibility of an object is defined in the code, meaning that to support a similar change, a programmer would be forced to rewrite the definitions fully, and could not have two versions at the same time.\n\n==Classes==\nClasses in Dylan describe <code>slots</code> (data members, fields, ivars, etc.) of objects in a fashion similar to most OO languages. All access to slots are via methods, as in [[Smalltalk]]. Default getter and setter methods are automatically generated based on the slot names.  In contrast with most other OO languages, other methods applicable to the class are often defined outside of the class, and thus class definitions in Dylan typically include the definition of the storage only. For instance:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=dylan>\ndefine class <window> (<view>)\n  slot title :: <string> = \"untitled\", init-keyword: title:;\n  slot position :: <point>, required-init-keyword: position:;\nend class;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn this example, the class \"<code>&lt;window&gt;</code>\" is defined. The &lt;class name&gt; syntax is convention only, to make the class names stand out\u2014the angle brackets are merely part of the class name. In contrast, in some languages the convention is to capitalize the first letter of the class name or to prefix the name with a ''C'' or ''T'' (for example). <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> inherits from a single class, <code>&lt;view&gt;</code>, and contains two slots, <code>title</code> holding a string for the window title, and <code>position</code> holding an X-Y point for a corner of the window. In this example, the title has been given a default value, while the position has not. The optional ''init-keyword'' syntax allows the programmer to specify the initial value of the slot when instantiating an object of the class.\n\nIn languages such as C++ or Java, the class would also define its interface. In this case the definition above has no explicit instructions, so in both languages access to the slots and methods is considered <code>protected</code>, meaning they can be used only by subclasses. To allow unrelated code to use the window instances, they must be declared <code>public</code>.\n\nIn Dylan, these sorts of visibility rules are not considered part of the code, but of the module/interface system. This adds considerable flexibility. For instance, one interface used during early development could declare everything public, whereas one used in testing and deployment could limit this. With C++ or Java these changes would require changes to the source code, so people won't do it, whereas in Dylan this is a fully unrelated concept.\n\nAlthough this example does not use it, Dylan also supports [[multiple inheritance]].\n\n==Methods and generic functions==\nIn Dylan, methods are not intrinsically associated with any specific class; methods can be thought of as existing outside of classes. Like CLOS, Dylan is based on [[multiple dispatch]] (multimethods), where the specific method to be called is chosen based on the types of all its arguments. The method need not be known at compile time, the understanding being that the required function may be available, or not, based on a user's preferences.\n\nUnder Java the same methods would be isolated in a specific class. To use that functionality the programmer is forced to ''import'' that class and refer to it explicitly to call the method. If that class is unavailable, or unknown at compile time, the application simply won't compile.\n\nIn Dylan, code is isolated from storage in ''functions''. Many classes have methods that call their own functions, thereby looking and feeling like most other OO languages. However code may also be located in ''generic functions'', meaning they are not attached to a specific class, and can be called natively by anyone. Linking a specific generic function to a method in a class is accomplished thusly:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=dylan>\ndefine method turn-blue (w :: <window>)\n  w.color := $blue;\nend method;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis definition is similar to those in other languages, and would likely be encapsulated within the <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> class. Note the := setter call, which is [[syntactic sugar]] for <code>color-setter($blue, w)</code>.\n\nThe utility of generic methods comes into its own when you consider more \"generic\" examples. For instance, one common function in most languages is the <code>to-string</code>, which returns some [[human-readable]] form for the object. For instance, a window might return its title and its position in parens, while a string would return itself. In Dylan these methods could all be collected into a single module called \"<code>to-string</code>\", thereby removing this code from the definition of the class itself. If a specific object did not support a <code>to-string</code>, it could be easily added in the <code>to-string</code> module.\n\n==Extensibility==\nThis whole concept might strike some readers as very odd. The code to handle <code>to-string</code> for a window isn't defined in <code>&lt;window&gt;</code>? This might not make any sense until you consider how Dylan handles the call of the <code>to-string</code>. In most languages{{which|date=June 2013}} when the program is compiled the <code>to-string</code> for <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> is looked up and replaced with a pointer (more or less) to the method. In Dylan this occurs when the program is first run; the [[Run time system|runtime]] builds a table of method-name/parameters details and looks up methods dynamically via this table. That means that a function for a specific method can be located anywhere, not just in the compile-time unit. In the end the programmer is given considerable flexibility in terms of where to place their code, collecting it along class lines where appropriate, and functional lines where it's not.\n\nThe implication here is that a programmer can add functionality to existing classes by defining functions in a separate file. For instance, you might wish to add spell checking to all <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>s, which in most languages would require access to the source code of the string class&mdash;and such basic classes are rarely given out in source form. In Dylan (and other \"extensible languages\") the spell checking method could be added in the <code>spell-check</code> module, defining all of the classes on which it can be applied via the <code>define method</code> construct. In this case the actual functionality might be defined in a single generic function, which takes a string and returns the errors. When the <code>spell-check</code> module is compiled into your program, all strings (and other objects) will get the added functionality.\n\n==Apple Dylan==\n{{main|Apple Dylan}}\nApple Dylan is the implementation of Dylan produced by [[Apple Computer]].

During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic [[data model]] for metadata, the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the [[linked data]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=DCMI Metadata Basics|publisher=dublincore.org/metadata-basics/}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Dublin Core Metadata Initiative''' (DCMI)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/ |title=DCMI Home: Dublin Core\u00ae Metadata Initiative (DCMI) |publisher=Dublincore.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-04}}</ref> provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online [[metadata standards]] for a broad range of purposes and of business models.

The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements.

The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.\n\nElement refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the ''Dumb-Down Principle'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/|title=DCMI: DCMI Grammatical Principles|author=|date=|website=www.dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.\n\nIn addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, \"2000-12-31\" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a '''human reader'''.\n\n'''Audience, Provenance''' and '''RightsHolder''' are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.<ref name=\"registry\"/>\n\n===DCMI Metadata Terms===\nThe DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.<ref name=\"dublincore1\"/> This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in ''italic''), as well as the qualified terms.

When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and are equally applicable in a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by machines and by human beings.\n\nThe '''Dublin Core Abstract Model'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/|title=DCMI: DCMI Abstract Model|author=|date=|website=dublincore.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model allows implementers to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntax.\n\n==Notable applications==\nOne [[Document Type Definition]] based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/|title=m e t a l a b open source metadata framework|author=|date=|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> OMF is in turn used by [[Rarian]] (superseding [[ScrollKeeper]]), which is used by the [[GNOME]] desktop and [[KDE]] help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.

The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style or content. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.<ref name=\"Introduction\">{{cite web\n| accessdate = 2012-01-12\n| location = http://www.w3.org/\n| publisher = W3C \n| title = Document Object Model (DOM)\n| quote = The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. \n| url = http://www.w3.org/DOM/#what}}</ref>\n\nThe principal standardization of DOM was handled by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]], which last developed a recommendation in 2004. [[WHATWG]] took over development of the standard, publishing it as a [[living document]]. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the \"[[browser wars]]\" of the late 1990s between [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[Microsoft Internet Explorer]], as well as with that of [[JavaScript]] and [[JScript]], the first [[scripting language]]s to be widely implemented in the [[JavaScript engine|JavaScript engines]] of [[web browser]]s.\n\nJavaScript was released by [[Netscape Communications]] in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0. Netscape's competitor, [[Microsoft]], released [[Internet Explorer 3|Internet Explorer 3.0]] the following year with a reimplementation of JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let [[web developer]]s create web pages with [[client-side]] interactivity. The limited facilities for detecting user-generated [[Event (computing)|events]] and modifying the HTML document in the first generation of these languages eventually became known as \"DOM Level 0\" or \"Legacy DOM.\" No independent standard was developed for DOM Level 0, but it was partly described in the specifications for [[HTML4|HTML 4]].\n\nLegacy DOM was limited in the kinds of [[HTML element|element]]s that could be accessed. [[Form (web)|Form]], [[Hyperlink|link]] and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a [[Text box|form input element]] could be accessed as either <code>document.formName.inputName</code> or <code>document.forms[0].elements[0]</code>.\n\nThe Legacy DOM enabled client-side form validation and the popular \"[[Rollover (web design)|rollover]]\" effect.\n\nIn 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer respectively, adding support for [[Dynamic HTML]] (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded HTML document. DHTML required extensions to the rudimentary document object that was available in the Legacy DOM implementations. Although the Legacy DOM implementations were largely compatible since JScript was based on JavaScript, the DHTML DOM extensions were developed in parallel by each browser maker and remained incompatible. These versions of the DOM became known as the \"Intermediate DOM.\"\n\nAfter the standardization of [[ECMAScript]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM specification. The completed specification, known as \"DOM Level 1\", was recommended by W3C in late 1998. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including [[Microsoft Internet Explorer 6|Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6]] (from 2001), [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browsers (like [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[SeaMonkey]] and [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]]).\n\n==Standards==\nThe [[W3C]] DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. Development efforts migrated to the [[WHATWG]], which continues to maintain a living standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/|title=DOM Standard|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/DOM/|title=W3C Document Object Model|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of [[HTML5]], the DOM Level 4 specification was reassigned to the [[HTML Working Group]] to expedite its completion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2013Sep/0129.html|title=New Charter for the HTML Working Group from Philippe Le Hegaret on 2013-09-30 (public-html-admin@w3.org from September 2013)|first=Philippe Le Hegaret|last=(plh@w3.org)|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web Platform group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/PubStatus|title=PubStatus - WEBAPPS|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.\n\n* DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or [[XML]] document, including the means to change any portion of the document.\n* DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the <code>getElementById</code> function as well as an [[DOM Events|event model]] and support for [[XML namespace]]s and CSS.\n* DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for [[XPath]] and keyboard [[event handling]], as well as an interface for [[serialization|serializing]] documents as XML.\n* DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-dom-20151119/|title=W3C DOM4|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Web browsers===\nTo [[Web browser engine|render]] a document such as an HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the '''DOM'''. The nodes of every document are organized in a [[tree structure]], called the ''DOM tree'', with the topmost node named as \"Document object\". When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.\n\n===JavaScript===\nWhen a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document, that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself and allows the creation of dynamic web pages:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp|title=JavaScript HTML DOM|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n* JavaScript can add, change, and remove all of the HTML elements and attributes in the page.\n* JavaScript can change all of the CSS styles in the page.\n* JavaScript can react to all of the existing events in the page.\n* JavaScript can create new events within the page.\n\n==Implementations==\nBecause DOM supports navigation in any direction (e.g., parent and previous sibling) and allows for arbitrary modifications, an implementation must at least buffer the document that has been read so far (or some parsed form of it).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Layout engines===\n{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (Document Object Model)}}\n\nWeb browsers rely on [[web browser engine|layout engine]]s to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident/MSHTML]], are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. Others, including [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]], [[WebKit]], and [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]], are shared by a number of browsers, such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Firefox]]. The different layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance.\n\n===Libraries===\nDOM implementations:\n\n* [[libxml2]]\n* [[MSXML]]\n* [[Xerces]] is a collection of DOM implementations written in C++, Java and Perl\n* XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; is a JavaScript-based DOM implementation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xmljs.sourceforge.net/|title=XML for <SCRIPT> Cross Platform XML Parser in JavaScript|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n* [[PHP.Gt]] DOM is based on libxml2 and brings DOM level 4 compatibility<ref>{{cite web|url=https://php.gt/dom#features-at-a-glance|title=The modern DOM API for PHP 7 projects}}</ref> to the [[PHP]] programming language\n* [https://github.com/fgnass/domino/ Domino] is a Server-side (Node.js) DOM implementation based on Mozilla's dom.js.

A pattern would not tell the designer how many windows to put in the room; instead, it would propose a set of values to guide the designer toward a decision that is best for their particular application. Alexander, for example, suggests that enough windows should be included to direct light all around the room. He considers this a good solution because he believes it increases the enjoyment of the room by its occupants. Other authors might come to different conclusions, if they place higher value on heating costs, or material costs. These values, used by the pattern's author to determine which solution is \"best\", must also be documented within the pattern.\n\nPattern documentation should also explain when it is applicable. Since two houses may be very different from one another, a design pattern for houses must be broad enough to apply to both of them, but not so vague that it doesn't help the designer make decisions. The range of situations in which a pattern can be used is called its context. Some examples might be \"all houses\", \"all two-story houses\", or \"all places where people spend time\".\n\nFor instance, in Christopher Alexander's work, bus stops and waiting rooms in a surgery center are both within the context for the pattern \"A PLACE TO WAIT\".\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* [[Software design pattern]], in software design.\n* [[Architectural pattern]], for software architecture.\n* [[Interaction design pattern]], used in interaction design / human-computer interaction\n* [[Pedagogical patterns]], in teaching.\n\nBusiness models also have design patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettler T, Eurich M |title=A \"design-pattern\"-based approach for analyzing e-health business models |journal=Health Policy & Technology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201385 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.hlpt.2012.04.005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |vauthors=Sprenger M, Mettler T |title=On the Utility of E-Health Business Model Design Patterns |conference=European Conference on Information Systems |year=2016 |url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/248256/ }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Design paradigm]]\n* [[Anti-pattern]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Christopher  |last=Alexander\n  |authorlink=Christopher Alexander\n  |title=[[A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]\n  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n  |year=1977\n  |isbn=0-19-501919-9\n  |ref=Alexander, A Pattern Language\n}}\n* {{cite book |author= [[Thomas Erl|Erl, Thomas]] |title=SOA Design Patterns |publisher=Prentice Hall/PearsonPTR |location=New York |year=2009 |pages=864 |isbn=0-13-613516-1 |oclc= |doi=}}\n* Frank Buschmann, [[Kevlin Henney]], [[Douglas C.

In this study participants received the DMT dosage intravenously via injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg) produced somaesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05&nbsp;mg/kg) had mild mood elevating and calming properties).<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" /> In contrast, higher doses (0.2 and 0.4&nbsp;mg/kg) researchers labeled as \"hallucinogenic\" that elicited \"intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both\". Comparing to other sensory modalities the most affected was visual domain. Participants reported visual hallucinations, less auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensation progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety.<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nStrassman also stressed the importance of the context where the drug has been taken. He claimed that DMT has no beneficial effects of itself, rather the context when and where people take it plays an important role.<ref name=\"strassman\" /><ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nIt appears that DMT can produce a hallucinogenic experience. It can induce a state or feeling to a person that he or she is able to \"communicate with other intelligent-life forms\" (see [[#Reported encounters with external entities|\"Machine Elves\"]]). High doses of DMT produce a hallucinatory state that involves sense of \"another intelligence\" that people sometimes describe as \"super-intelligent\", but \"emotionally detached\".<ref name=\"pmid8297216\" />\n\nIn 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter did a study where they found that DMT-induced altered state of consciousness (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors. In the study researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to describe ASC (rating scales of ASC).

Its [[biosynthesis]] is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid [[L-tryptophan]] is produced endogenously where in animals [[L-tryptophan]] is an [[essential amino acid]] coming from diet. No matter the source of [[L-tryptophan]], the biosynthesis begins with its [[decarboxylation]] by an [[aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]] (AADC) [[enzyme]] (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] is [[tryptamine]]. Tryptamine then undergoes a [[transmethylation]] (step 2): the enzyme [[tryptamine-N-methyltransferase|indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase]] (INMT) [[Catalysis|catalyzes]] the transfer of a [[methyl group]] from [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[S-adenosyl-methionine]] (SAM), via [[nucleophilic]] attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into [[S-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH), and gives the intermediate product [[N-methyltryptamine|''N''-methyltryptamine]] (NMT).<ref name=\"pmid13685339\">{{cite journal |author=Axelrod J. |title=Enzymatic formation of psychotomimetic metabolites from normally occurring compounds |journal=Science |volume=134 |issue= 3475|page=343 |date=August 1961 |pmid=13685339 |doi=10.1126/science.134.3475.343 |url=}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid779022\">{{cite journal |author1=Rosengarten H. |author2=Friedhoff A.J. |title=A review of recent studies of the biosynthesis and excretion of hallucinogens formed by methylation of neurotransmitters or related substances |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013105 |year=1976 |pmid=779022 |doi=10.1093/schbul/2.1.90 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/1/90.full.pdf |format= PDF}}</ref> NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product ''N'',''N''-dimethyltryptamine.

Following Shulgin's notes, the first synthesis starts with tryptamine followed by trimethylation using methyl iodide to obtain the trimethylammonium iodide salt. This is then demethylated using [[LiEt3BH]] to obtain DMT. The iodide salt of the trimethylammonium intermediate can be converted to the chloride salt followed by a different demethylation procedure. The second procedure avoids the over methylation of the amine and uses ethyl formate reacted with tryptamine for a double N-formylation. These are then reduced using [[lithium aluminum hydride]] to obtain the dimethyl amine product. The third synthesis starts from indole and oxalyl chloride which forms indol-3-ylglyoxyl chloride. This is then reacted with dimethylamine followed by reduction using [[lithium aluminum hydride]] to obtain DMT. Depending on the final work-up the free base or any of its various salts may be obtained as products. Shulgin gives a procedure for obtaining the hydrochloride salt by dissolving DMT in diethyl ether followed by sparging with HCl gas. He also mentions the picrate, oxalate and fumarate salts.<ref>https://erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal06.shtml</ref>\n\n===Clandestine manufacture===\n[[File:Dmt1234.jpg|right|thumb|DMT during various stages of purification]]\nIn a clandestine setting, DMT is not typically synthesized due to the lack of availability of the starting materials, namely tryptamine and oxalyl chloride.  It is more often extracted from plant sources using a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane due to the ease of availability of both the plant source and solvents, neither of which are controlled in most countries.\n\n====Evidence in mammals====\nPublished in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1961, [[Julius Axelrod]] found an ''N''-[[methyltransferase]] enzyme capable of mediating biotransformation of tryptamine into DMT in a rabbit's lung.<ref name=\"pmid13685339\" /> This finding initiated a still ongoing scientific interest in endogenous DMT production in humans and other mammals.<ref name=\"pmid779022\" /><ref name=\"pmid16095048\">{{cite journal |author1=K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen J. |author2=Forsstr\u00f6m T. |author3=Tornaeus J. |author4=W\u00e4h\u00e4l\u00e4 K. |author5=Kiuru P. |author6=Honkanen A. |author7=Stenman U.-H. |author8=Turpeinen U. |author9=Hesso A. |date=April 2005 |title=Potentially hallucinogenic 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor ligands bufotenine and dimethyltryptamine in blood and tissues |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=189\u2013199 |quote= |doi=10.1080/00365510510013604 |pmid=16095048}}</ref> From then on, two major complementary lines of evidence have been investigated: localization and further characterization of the ''N''-methyltransferase enzyme, and [[Analytical chemistry|analytical studies]]&nbsp;looking for endogenously produced DMT in body fluids and tissues.<ref name=\"pmid779022\" />\n\nIn 2013 researchers first reported DMT in the [[pineal gland]] [[microdialysis|microdialysate]] of rodents.<ref name=\"pmid23881860\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barker SA, Borjigin J, Lomnicka I, Strassman R |title=LC/MS/MS analysis of the endogenous dimethyltryptamine hallucinogens, their precursors, and major metabolites in rat pineal gland microdialysate |journal=[[Biomed Chromatogr.]] |date=Jul 2013 |volume= 27|issue= 12|pages= 1690\u20131700|pmid=23881860 |doi=10.1002/bmc.2981|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/101767/1/bmc2981.pdf}}</ref>\n\nA study published in 2014 reported the biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the human melanoma cell line SK-Mel-147 including details on its metabolism by peroxidases.<ref name=\"pmid24508833\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes MM, Coimbra JB, Clara RO, D\u00f6rr FA, Moreno AC, Chagas JR, Tufik S, ((Pinto E Jr)), Catalani LH, Campa A |title=Biosynthesis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in a melanoma cell line and its metabolization by peroxidases |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] |date=2014 |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=393\u2013401 |pmid=24508833 |doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2014.01.035}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2014 paper a group first demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of DMT and [[5-MeO-DMT]] through the [[Sigma-1 receptor]] of human immune cells.

A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. The role of a dominatrix may not even involve physical pain toward the submissive; her domination can be verbal, involving humiliating tasks, or servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (''pro-domme'') as the term ''dominatrix'' is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.\n\nThe term ''domme'' is a coined pseudo-French female variation of the slang ''dom'' (short for ''dominant''). The use of ''domme'', ''dominatrix'', ''dom'', or ''dominant'' by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene.<ref>{{harvp|Easton|Hardy|2002|p=iii}}: \"Semantics vary widely throughout the kinky world, from one region to the next, one sexual orientation to the next, one playstyle to the next.\"</ref> The term ''mistress''  or ''dominant mistress'' is sometimes also used. ''Female dominance'', ''female domination'' or '''''femdom''''' refer to BDSM activities in which the dominant partner is female.\n\nAs fetish culture is increasingly becoming more prevalent in Western media, [[List of dominatrices in popular culture|depictions of dominatrices in film and television]] have become more common.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Dominatrix'' is the feminine form of the [[Latin]] ''dominator'', a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in S&M, dates to 1967.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Dominatrix|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/56699|subscription=yes}}</ref> It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger's pulp paperback ''The Bizarre Lovemakers''.<ref>Rogers, Bruce (1967) \"The Bizarre Lovemakers\" cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=131}}.</ref> The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title ''Dominatrix'' (with art by [[Eric Stanton]]) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film ''Dominatrix Without Mercy''.<ref>{{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=132}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term ''dominatrix'' was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' by Austrian writer [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. The term ''[[Sadomasochism|masochism]]'' was later derived from the author's name by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in the latter's 1886 forensic study ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ostra Studio violin student.jpg|thumb|upright|A scene where both dominant and submissive are female, circa 1930s. A music teacher is caning the buttocks of a student with a [[violin bow]].]]\n\nThe history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the Goddess [[Inanna]] (or [[Ishtar]] as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of \"Hymns to Inanna\" have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing Gods and men into submission to her.<ref>\"Inana and Ebih\" ETCSL, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm cited in {{harvp|Nomis|2013|p=53}}</ref> Archaeologist and historian Anne O.

An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a \"session\", and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a \"dungeon\". Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email or online chat. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.\n\nWomen who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms \"dominatrix\", \"mistress\", \"lady\", \"madame\", \"herrin\" or \"goddess\". In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.<ref>{{harvp|Wilson|2005|p=40}}</ref>\n\nSome professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients.

In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive's finances or a \"blackmail\" scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where  such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=What is Findom?

Some professional dominatrices are also \"lifestyle\" dominatrices - i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships.<ref>Williams, Holly (2011)  \"Unleashed: The secret world of Britain's Dominatrixes\" in [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/fantasies-fetishes/unleashed-the-secret-world-of-britains-dominatrixes-6263209.html The Independent, 20 November 2011]</ref> However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more, the connotation of \"professional.\"\n\n==Imagery==\n[[File:Vivian LaVey at AVN Adult Entertainment Expo 2011 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A dominatrix wearing typical [[fetish fashion]] themed [[Latex clothing|latex]] dress, [[fishnet stockings]] and [[stiletto heels]]. She is holding a [[Paddle (spanking)|spanking paddle]].]]\n\nThe dominatrix is a female [[archetype]] which operates on a symbolic mode of representation, associated with particular attire and props that are drawn on within popular culture to signify her role\u2014as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman\u2014linked to but distinct from images of [[sexual fetish]].<ref>{{harvp|Reichert|Lambiase|2003|p=77}}</ref> During the twentieth century, the imagery associated with dominatrices was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer [[Charles Guyette]], the publisher and film director [[Irving Klaw]], and the illustrators [[Eric Stanton]] and [[Gene Bilbrew]] who drew for the fetish magazine [[Exotique]].\n\nOne of the ubiquitous garments associated with the dominatrix is the [[catsuit]]. Historically, the black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the ''[[AtomAge]]'' magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]]. The spill-over into mainstream culture, occurred with catsuits being worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', and in the comic super-heroines such as [[Catwoman]], in which the catsuit represented the independent woman capable of \"kick-ass\" moves and antics, enabling complete freedom of movement. On another level, the one-piece [[catsuit]] accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman's body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. \"You can look but you can't touch\" is the mechanism of this operation, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as \"[[tease and denial]]\".<ref>{{harvp|Tse\u00eblon|2004|p=75}}</ref>\n\nOther common signifying footwear of the dominatrix are [[thigh-high boots]] in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called [[kinky boots]], along with the very high [[stiletto heel]]. [[Fishnet]] stockings, [[Seamed stockings|seamed hosiery]], and [[stocking]]s and [[Garter (stockings)#Garter belts|garter belts]] (suspenders) are also popular accents in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of their legs, with erotic connotation.\n\nTight, leather [[corset]]s are another staple garment of the dominatrix signification. Gloves, whether long [[opera gloves]] or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. [[Neck corset]]s may also be worn. \n\nDominatrices often wear clothing made from [[fetish fashion]] materials. Examples include  [[PVC clothing]], [[latex clothing]] and garments drawn from the [[leather subculture]]. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from [[Nazi chic]], particularly the black [[SS officer]]'s uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a [[uniform fetish]].\n\nThe body language of the dominatrix is frequently represented by the use of strong, dominant body-language which is comparable to the [[animal communication|dominant posturing in the animal world]]. The props she may brandish will strongly signify her role as dominatrix, such as bearing a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of [[Bruno Zach]] in the early 20th century,<ref name=Bonhams>{{cite web|title=Bruno Zach's 'Riding Crop Girl' hits World Record $150,602 at Bonhams art auction|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/bruno-zachs-riding-crop-girl-hits-world-record-150-602-at-bonhams-art-auction|website=justcollecting.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Bonhams Lot 116\">{{cite web|title=Lot 116 - Bruno Zach 'The Riding Crop' an Impressive Green and Gilt Patinated Bronze|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20122/lot/116/|website=Bonhams.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> in conventional representation. \n\nPracticing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional signifiers of the role, or adapt them to create their own individual style, where there exists a potential pull\u2014between meeting conventional expectations, and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess, the [[KGB]] secret agent, to their own ends.<ref>{{harvp|Wilson|2005}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[BDSM in culture and media]]\n* [[Chastity belt (BDSM)]]\n* [[Clothed female, naked male]]\n* [[Domination and submission]]\n* [[Female submission]]\n* [[Feminization (activity)]]\n* [[List of dominatrices in popular culture]]\n* [[Male dominance (BDSM)]]\n* [[Male submission]]\n* [[Mistress Matisse]]\n* [[Pegging (sexual practice)]]\n* [[Sadism and masochism in fiction]]\n* [[Session wrestler]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Books==\n* [[Tomi Ungerer]]: ''Schutzengel der H\u00f6lle'', Diogenes 1986, {{ISBN|3-257-02016-3}}\n* [[Ma\u00eetresse Fran\u00e7oise|Annick Foucault]], ''Fran\u00e7oise ma\u00eetresse'', Gallimard 1994, {{ISBN|2-07-073834-5}}\n* [[Shawna Kenney]], ''I Was a Teenage Dominatrix: a Memoir'', Last Gasp 2002, {{ISBN|0-86719-530-4}}\n* [[Melissa Febos]], ''Whip Smart'', St. Martin's Press 2010, {{ISBN|0-312-56102-4}}\n* Susan Winemaker ''Concertina: the Life and Loves of a Dominatrix'', Pocket Books 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-2689-6}}\n* Evangelline Dubois: ''How To Be A Domme: the Practical Guide to Becoming a Professional Dominatrix'', 2011\n* Anthony McGee: ''How to be Dominated like a Man'', McGee 2013, {{ISBN|0-86547-452-4}}\n* Anne O.

The flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Hemmingstedt]] on 17 February 1500. \nIn 1559, King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederik II]] recaptured it during his own [[Dithmarschen]] campaign.\nIn 1576, the son of ''Johan Rantzau'', [[Henrik Rantzau]], also writes about the war and the fate of the flag. He notes that the flag was in a poor condition when returned. \nContemporary records describing the battle of Hemmingstedt make no reference to the loss of the original Dannebrog, although the capitulation state that all Danish banners lost in 1500 were to be returned.\nIn a letter dated 22 February 1500 to [[Oluf Stigs\u00f8n]], King John describes the battle, but does not mention the loss of an important flag. In fact, the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was of limited importance.\nIn 1598, [[Neocorus]] wrote that the banner captured in 1500 was brought to the church in [[W\u00f6hrden]] and hung there for the next 59 years, until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559.\n[[Henrik Rantzau]] in 1576 records that the flag after its return to Denmark was placed in the cathedral in [[City of Schleswig|Slesvig]]. Slesvig historian [[Ulrik Petersen]] (1656\u20131735) confirms the presence of such a banner in the cathedral in the early 17th century, and records that it had crumbled away by about 1660.\n\n=== Maritime flags ===\nThe size and shape of the [[civil ensign]] (\"''Koffardiflaget''\") for merchant ships is given in the regulation of 11 June 1748, which says: ''A red flag with a white cross with no split end. The white cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be {{frac|6|4}} lengths of those''.\nThe proportions are thus: 3:1:3 vertically and 3:1:4.5 horizontally. This definition are the absolute proportions for the Danish national flag to this day, for both the civil version of the flag (\"''Stutflaget''\"), as well as the merchant flag (\"''Handelsflaget''\"). Both flags are identical.\n\nA regulation passed in 1758 required Danish ships sailing in the [[Mediterranean]] to carry the \n[[royal cypher]] in the center of the flag in order to distinguish them from Maltese ships, due to the similarity of the [[flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].\n\nAccording to the regulation of 11 June 1748 the colour was simply red, which is common known today as \"Dannebrog r\u00f8d\" (\"''Dannebrog red''\"). The only available red fabric dye in 1748 was made of [[Rubia|madder root]], which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye (used historically for British soldiers' jackets). \nA regulation of 4 May 1927 once again states that Danish merchant ships have to fly flags according to the regulation of 1748.\n\nThe first regulation regarding the ''Splitflag'' dates from 27 March 1630, in which King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] orders that Norwegian ''Defensionskibe'' (armed merchants ships) may only use the ''Splitflag'' if they are in Danish war service.\nIn 1685 an order, distributed to a number of cities in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Slesvig]], states that all ships must carry the Danish flag, and in 1690 all merchant ships are forbidden to use the ''Splitflag'', with the exception of ships sailing in the [[East Indies]], [[West Indies]] and along the coast of [[Africa]].\nIn 1741 it is confirmed that the regulation of 1690 is still very much in effect; that merchant ships may not use the ''Splitflag''. At the same time the [[Danish East India Company]] is allowed to fly the ''Splitflag'' when past the [[equator]].\n\nSome confusion must have existed regarding the ''Splitflag''. In 1696 the Admiralty presented the King with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the ''Splitflag''. In the same year a royal resolution defines the proportions of the ''Splitflag'', which in this resolution is called ''Kongeflaget'' (the King's flag), as follows: ''The cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flags height. The two first fields must be square in form with the sides three times the cross width. The two outer fields are rectangular and {{Frac|1|1|2}} the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the flag''.\n\nThese numbers are the basic for the ''Splitflag'', or ''Orlogsflag'', today, though the numbers have been slightly altered. The term ''Orlogsflag'' dates from 1806 and denotes use in the Danish Navy.\n\nFrom about 1750 to early 19th century a number of ships and companies which the government has interests in, received approval to use the ''Splitflag''.\n\nIn the royal resolution of 25 October 1939 for the Danish Navy, it is stated that the ''Orlogsflag'' is a ''Splitflag'' with a deep red (\"''dybr\u00f8d''\") or madder red (\"''krapr\u00f8d''\") colour. Like the National flag, no nuance is given, but in modern days this is given as 195U.\nFurthermore, the size and shape is corrected in this resolution to be: \"The cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form with the height of {{Frac|3|7}} of the flag's height. The two outer fields are rectangular and {{frac|5|4}} the length of the square fields. The tails are {{frac|6|4}} the length of the rectangular fields\".\nThus, if compared to the standard of 1696, both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size.\n\n===National flag===\n[[File:Tropper 1849.jpg|thumb|300px|Danish soldiers return to Copenhagen after the [[Battle of Fredericia]] (1849), a Danish victory against German insurgents in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] and [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] in the [[First Schleswig War]] (1894 painting by [[Otto Bache]])]]\nUsed as maritime flag since the 16th century, the Dannebrog was introduced as regimental flag in the Danish army in 1785, and\nfor the militia (landev\u00e6rn) in 1801. From 1842, it was used as the flag of the entire army.<ref name=Achen108>Sven Tito Achen, '' Heraldikkens femten gl\u00e6der'' (1978), p. 108f.</ref>\n\nIn parallel to the development of [[Romantic nationalism]] in other European countries, the military flag increasingly came to be seen as representing the nation itself during the first half of the 19th century. Poems of this period invoking the ''Dannebrog'' were written by B.S. Ingemann, N.F.S. Grundtvig, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, Chr. Winther and H.C. Andersen.<ref name=Achen108/>\nBy the 1830s, the military flag had become so popular as unofficial national flag, and its use by private citizens was outlawed in a circular enacted on 7 January 1834. In the national enthusiasm sparked by the [[First Schleswig War]] during 1848&ndash;1850, the flag was still very widely displayed, and the prohibition of private use was again repealed in a regulation of 7 July 1854, for the first time allowing Danish citizens to display the Dannebrog (but not the swallow-tailed ''Splitflag'' variant).<ref>''[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=58409 Cirkul\u00e6rer om oph\u00e6velse af forbuddet mod flagning i kanceli cirkul\u00e6re af 7. januar 1834]'' (retsinformation.dk)</ref>\nSpecial permission to use the ''Splitflag'' was given to individual institutions and private companies, especially after 1870.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\nOn 10 April 1915, the hoisting of any ''other'' flag on Danish soil was prohibited.<ref>''International Law Studies'', Naval War College (U.S.),  1918, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=trmPvyYVRhgC&pg=PA83 p. 83].</ref>\nIn 1886, the war ministry introduced a regulation indicating that the flag should be flown from military buildings on thirteen specified days, including royal birthdays, the date of the signing of the Constitution of 5 June 1849 and on days of remembrance for military battles. \nIn 1913, the naval ministry issued its own list of flag days. From 1939, the yearbook ''Hvem-Hvad-Hvor'' included a list of flag days.\n\n== Origin legend ==\n[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dannebrog falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], 15 June 1219. Painted by [[Christian August Lorentzen]] in 1809. Original located at [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Denmark]]\nA tradition recorded in the 16th century traces the origin of the flag to the campaigns of \n[[Valdemar II of Denmark]] (r. 1202&ndash;1241).\nThe oldest of them is in [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s \"''Danske Kr\u00f8nike''\", which is a sequel to [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]\u2019s [[Gesta Danorum]], written 1520\u201323. Here, the flag falls from the sky during a Russian campaign of Valdemar's. Pedersen also states that the very same flag was taken into exile by [[Eric of Pomerania]] in 1440.\n\nThe second source is the writing of the Franciscan monk [[Petrus Olai]] (Peder Olsen) of [[Roskilde]] (died c. 1570).  This record describes a battle in 1208 near a place called \"''Felin''\" during the [[Baltic crusades|Estonia campaign]] of King Valdemar II. The Danes were all but defeated when a lamb-skin banner depicting a white cross fell from the sky and miraculously led to a Danish victory. \nIn a third account, also by Petrus Olai{{dubious|date=July 2016}}, in ''Danmarks Tolv Herligheder'' (\"Twelve Splendours of Denmark\"), in splendour number nine, the same story is re-told almost verbatim, with a paragraph inserted correcting the year to 1219.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}<!--the existence of such a work cannot be substantiated except for mentions in passing in exactly this context (Dannebrog). Also, if it exists, it isn't clear that \"Peder Olsen\" is the same Peder as the Petrus Olai of Roskild-->\nNow, the flag is falling from the sky in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: ''Volmerslaget''), near [[Lindanise]] (Tallinn) in [[Estonia]], of 15 June 1219.\n\nIt is this third account that has been the most influential, and some historians{{Who|date=April 2010}}  have treated it as the primary account taken from a (lost) source dating to the first half of the 15th century.\n\nIn Olai's account, the battle was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop [[Anders Sunesen]] on top of a hill overlooking the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.\n\nThe possible historical nucleus behind this origin legend was extensively discussed by Danish historians in the 19th to 20th centuries.\nJ\u00f8rgensen (1875) argues that [[Theoderich, Bishop of Estonia|Bishop Theoderich]]  was the original instigator of the 1218 inquiry from Bishop [[Albert of Buxhoeveden]] to King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] which led to the Danish participation in the Baltic crusades.\nJ\u00f8rgensen speculates that Bishop Theoderich might have carried the Knight Hospitaller's banner in the 1219 battle and that \"the enemy thought this was the King's symbol and mistakenly stormed Bishop Theoderich tent. He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle.\"<ref name=\"Adolf Ditlev J\u00f8rgensen 1875\"/> \nThe Danish church-historian L. P. Fabricius (1934)<ref>L. P. Fabricius ''Sagnet om Dannebrog og de \u00e6ldste Forbindelser med Estland'' (1934)</ref>  ascribes the origin to the 1208 Battle of [[Fellin]], not the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in 1219, based on the earliest source available about the story.\nFabricius speculated that it might have been Archbishop [[Andreas Sunes\u00f8n]]'s personal ecclesiastical banner or perhaps even the flag of Archbishop [[Absalon]], under whose initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in Estonia. The banner would then already be known in Estonia. \nFabricius repeats J\u00f8rgensen's idea about the flag being planted in front of Bishop Theodorik's tent, which the enemy mistakenly attacks believing it to be the tent of the King.\nA different theory is briefly discussed by Fabricius and elaborated more by Helge Bruhn (1949).  Bruhn interprets the story in the context of the widespread tradition of the miraculous appearance of crosses in the sky in Christian legend, specifically comparing such an event attributed to a battle of 10 September 1217 near [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal|Alcazar]], where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky, to bring victory to the Christians.<ref name=\"Bruhn1949\">{{cite book|author=Helge Bruhn|title=Dannebrog: og danske faner gennem tiderne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXUAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=Jespersen og Pio|pages=17\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Swedish national historiography of the 18th century, there is a tale paralleling the Danish legend, in which \na golden cross appears in the blue sky during a Swedish battle in Finland in 1157.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:CyclingTeamPursuitBeijing2008.jpg|thumb|right|The Danish flag at the medal ceremony for the [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team pursuit|men's team pursuit]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.]]\n\n=== Splitflag and Orlogsflag ===\n{{flag image|Image = Flag of Denmark (state).svg|Caption = The ''Splitflag'' \u2013 the Danish State Flag.

There are though a few exceptions to this. A few institutions have been allowed to fly the clean ''Orlogsflag''. The same flag with markings has been approved for a few dozen companies and institutions over the years.\n\nFurthermore, the ''Orlogsflag'' is only described as such if it has no additional markings. Any swallow-tail flag, no matter the color, is called a ''Splitflag'' provided it bears additional markings.\n\n=== Royal standards ===\n;Monarch\nThe current version of the [[royal standard]] was introduced on 16 November 1972 when the [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen]] adopted a new version of her personal coat of arms.  The royal standard is the flag of Denmark with a swallow-tail and charged with the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|monarch\u2019s coat of arms]] set in a white square.

The Brahman (whom all the gods make up), claim the hymns of the Rig Veda, created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains.<ref name=paulhorsch/><ref>RgVeda 6.70.1, 8.41.10, 10.44.8, for secondary source see [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]], Der Rigveda in Auswahl (2 vols.), Stuttgart; and [[Harvard Oriental Series]], 33\u201336, Bd. 1\u20133: 1951.</ref> The gods, mainly [[Indra]], then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability \u2013 actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma.<ref name=phph/> In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of gods.

Near the end of the epic, the god Yama, referred to as dharma in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, but refuses to abandon his companion, for which decision he is then praised by dharma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17003.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 3|publisher=}}</ref> The value and appeal of the Mahabharata is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book, claims Ingalls,<ref name=danielingalls/> because Indian metaphysics is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures; the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, is in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, to which there are usually three answers given, according to Ingalls:<ref name=danielingalls/> one answer is of [[Bhima]], which is the answer of brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of [[Yudhishthira]], which is always an appeal to piety and gods, of social virtue and of tradition; the third answer is of introspective [[Arjuna]], which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man.

It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]), as opposed to the parables and to the poems.\n\nThe status of Dharma is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the \"[[three realms]]\" (Sanskrit: ''tridhatu'') and the \"wheel of becoming\" (Sanskrit: ''[[bhavachakra]]''), somewhat like the pagan Greek and Christian [[logos]]: this is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' (Sanskrit). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the Dharma as the [[essence]] of the \"84,000 different aspects of the teaching\" (Tibetan: ''chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong'') that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.\n\nDharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various [[schools of Buddhism]] have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha's teachings. For others still, they see the Dharma as referring to the \"truth\", or the ultimate reality of \"the way that things really are\" (Tib. Cho).\n\nThe Dharma is one of the [[Three Jewels]] of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], meaning the mind's perfection of enlightenment, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], meaning the monastic community who provide guidance and support to followers of the Buddha.\n\n===Chan Buddhism===\nDharma is employed in [[Ch'an]] in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in [[Dharma transmission]].\n\n==Jainism==\n{{Main article|Dharma (Jainism)}}\n[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|140px|Jainism]]\n\nThe word Dharma in Jainism is found in all its key texts.

Those considerations that are selected by the agent as having a more than negligible bearing on the decision then figure in a reasoning process, and if the agent is in the main reasonable, those considerations ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent's final decision.<ref>''Brainstorms'', p. 295</ref>}}\n\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including [[William James]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Arthur Holly Compton]], and [[Henry Margenau]], Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|\n# First ... The intelligent selection, rejection, and weighing of the considerations that do occur to the subject is a matter of intelligence making the difference.\n# Second, I think it installs indeterminism in the right place for the libertarian, if there is a right place at all.\n# Third ... from the point of view of biological engineering, it is just more efficient and in the end more rational that decision making should occur in this way.\n# A fourth observation in favor of the model is that it permits moral education to make a difference, without making all of the difference.\n# Fifth\u2014and I think this is perhaps the most important thing to be said in favor of this model\u2014it provides some account of our important intuition that we are the authors of our moral decisions.\n# Finally, the model I propose points to the multiplicity of decisions that encircle our moral decisions and suggests that in many cases our ultimate decision as to which way to act is less important phenomenologically as a contributor to our sense of free will than the prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself: the decision, for instance, not to consider any further, to terminate deliberation; or the decision to ignore certain lines of inquiry.\n}}\n\n{{quote|These prior and subsidiary decisions contribute, I think, to our sense of ourselves as responsible free agents, roughly in the following way: I am faced with an important decision to make, and after a certain amount of deliberation, I say to myself: \"That's enough. I've considered this matter enough and now I'm going to act,\" in the full knowledge that I could have considered further, in the full knowledge that the eventualities may prove that I decided in error, but with the acceptance of responsibility in any case.<ref>''Brainstorms'', pp. 295\u201397</ref>}}\n\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, [[Moral character|character]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and feelings and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]]. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\n\n{{quote|[As Dennett admits,] a causal indeterminist view of this deliberative kind does not give us everything libertarians have wanted from free will. For [the agent] does not have complete control over what chance images and other thoughts enter his mind or influence his deliberation. They simply come as they please. [The agent] does have some control ''after'' the chance considerations have occurred.}}\n{{quote|But then there is no more chance involved. What happens from then on, how he reacts, is ''determined'' by desires and beliefs he already has. So it appears that he does not have control in the ''libertarian'' sense of what happens after the chance considerations occur as well. Libertarians require more than this for full responsibility and free will.<ref>Robert Kane, ''A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will'', Oxford (2005) pp. 64\u20135</ref>}}\n\n===Philosophy of mind===\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in ''Brainchildren'') that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in [[empirical]] research. In his original [[Thesis|dissertation]], ''Content and Consciousness'', he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as ''Content and Consciousness'' has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided ''Brainstorms'' into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in ''The [[Intentional stance|Intentional Stance]]'' and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.<ref>{{citation |last=Guttenplan |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Guttenplan|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1994 |pages=642 |isbn=0-631-19996-9}}</ref>\n\nIn chapter 5 of ''Consciousness Explained'' Dennett describes his [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception\u2014indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity\u2014are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p.&nbsp;111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something ''rather like'' a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p.&nbsp;135, emphasis in the original).\n\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as [[Neural Darwinism]]. He also presents an argument against [[qualia]]; he argues that the [[concept]] is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of [[physicalism]]. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\n\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms: \"[Others] note that my 'avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless\u2014a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors.\"<ref>Daniel Dennett, ''The Message is: There is no Medium''</ref>\n\nIn ''Consciousness Explained'', he affirms \"I am a sort of '[[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|teleofunctionalist]]', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist'\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of [[Verificationism|verificationist]]\".{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Evolutionary debate===\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (''Kinds of Minds''), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (''[[Freedom Evolves]]'').\n\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an [[algorithm]]ic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as [[long division]] often incorporate a significant degree of [[randomness]]).<ref>p. 52-60, ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life'' (Simon & Schuster; reprint edition 1996) ({{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}})</ref> This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\n\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly [[Adaptationism|adaptationist]], in line with his theory of the [[intentional stance]], and the evolutionary views of [[biologist]] Richard Dawkins. In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould.  This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with [[E. O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over human [[sociobiology]] and its descendant [[evolutionary psychology]], which Gould and [[Richard Lewontin]] opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and [[Steven Pinker]].<ref>Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of \"[[greedy reductionism]]\", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism\u2014previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\" Gould, 1980.

The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. Dennett makes this case on the basis that [[natural selection]] is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the [[evolution]] of [[life]]. Darwin's discovery was that the generation of life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a way that given these processes the results that they tend toward must be so.\n\nDennett says, for example, that by claiming that minds cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to purely algorithmic processes, many of his eminent contemporaries are claiming that [[miracles]] can occur. These assertions have generated a great deal of debate and discussion in the general public. The book was a finalist for the 1995 [[National Book Award]] in non-fiction<ref>[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1995.html The National Book Foundation]</ref> and the 1996 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]].<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/1996 The Pulitzer Prizes - 1996 Finalists]</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nDennett's previous book was ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' (1991). Dennett noted discomfort with [[Darwinism]] among not only lay people but also even academics and decided it was time to write a book dealing with the subject.<ref>Material in this section is largely drawn from ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', preface.</ref> ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'' is not meant to be a work of [[science]], but rather an [[interdisciplinary]] book; Dennett admits that he does not understand all of the scientific details himself. He goes into a moderate level of detail, but leaves it for the reader to go into greater depth if desired, providing references to this end.\n\nIn writing the book, Dennett wanted to \"get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary theory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens\". To do this he tells a story; one that is mainly original but includes some material from his previous work.\n\nDennett taught an undergraduate seminar at [[Tufts University]] on Darwin and philosophy, which included most of the ideas in the book. He also had the help of fellow staff and other academics, some of whom read drafts of the book.<ref>These include [[Richard Dawkins]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Nick Humphrey]], [[Ray Jackendoff]], [[Philip Kitcher]], [[Justin Leiber]], [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Steve Pinker]] and [[Kim Sterelny]].</ref> It is dedicated to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], \"teacher and friend\".<ref>''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', p. 5</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Part I: Starting in the Middle===\n\"Starting in the Middle\", Part I of ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', gets its name from a quote by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]: \"Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle. Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distance objects, and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race.\"\n\nThe first chapter \"Tell Me Why\" is named after a song.\n\n{{quote|text=\nTell me why the stars do shine,<br>\nTell me why the ivy twines, <br>\nTell me why the sky's so blue.<br>\nThen I will tell you just why I love you.<br>\n\nBecause God made the stars to shine,<br>\nBecause God made the ivy twine,<br>\nBecause God made the sky so blue.<br>\nBecause God made you, that's why I love you.}}\n\nBefore [[Charles Darwin]], and still today, a majority of people see [[God]] as the [[ultimate cause]] of all design, or the ultimate answer to 'why<!-- this should have an article too... -->?' questions. [[John Locke]] argued for the primacy of [[mind]] before [[matter]],<ref>{{cite book |title=[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]] |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |year=1690 |publisher= |location=London |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> and [[David Hume]], while exposing problems with Locke's view,<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]] |last=Hume |first=David |authorlink=David Hume |year=1779 |publisher= |location=London |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> could not see any alternative.\n\n[[Image:Cranes from Encyclop\u00e9die.jpg|thumb|''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'' makes extensive use of [[crane (machine)|crane]]s as an analogy.]]\nDarwin provided just such an alternative: [[evolution]].<ref>{{cite book |title=[[On the Origin of Species]] |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1859 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> Besides providing [[evidence of common descent]], he introduced a [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] to explain it: [[natural selection]]. According to Dennett, natural selection is a mindless, mechanical and [[algorithm]]ic process&mdash;Darwin's dangerous idea. The third chapter introduces the concept of \"skyhooks\" and \"cranes\" (see below). He suggests that resistance to [[Darwinism]] is based on a desire for skyhooks, which do not really exist. According to Dennett, good [[reductionism|reductionists]] explain apparent [[design]] without skyhooks; [[greedy reductionism|greedy reductionists]] try to explain it without cranes.\n\nChapter 4 looks at the [[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]], such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in [[evolutionary history of life|life's history]]. The next chapter concerns the possible<!--  we should have an article on this, no? --> and the actual, using the 'Library of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]' (the space of all [[logical possibility|logically possible]] [[genome]]s) as a conceptual aid.\n\nIn the last chapter of part I, Dennett treats human [[social artifact|artifacts]] and [[culture]] as a branch of a unified Design Space. [[Common descent|Descent]] or [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently. However, there are also \"Forced Moves\" or \"Good Tricks\" that will be discovered repeatedly, either by natural selection (see [[convergent evolution]]) or human investigation.\n\n===Part II: Darwinian Thinking in Biology===\n[[Image:Origin of Species illustration cropped.png|thumb|left|Tree diagram in ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin]]'']]\nThe first chapter of part II, \"Darwinian Thinking in Biology\", asserts that [[origin of life|life originated]] without any skyhooks, and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos.\n\nThe eighth chapter's message is conveyed by its title, \"Biology is Engineering\"; [[biology]] is the study of design, [[function (biology)|function]], construction and operation. However, there are some important differences between biology and [[engineering]]. Related to the engineering concept of optimization, the next chapter deals with [[adaptationism]], which Dennett endorses, calling [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]]'s \"refutation\" of it<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author2=[[Richard Lewontin]]  |year=1979 |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=205 |issue= 1161|pages=581\u2013598 |id= |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/perspectives/Gould_Lewontin_1979.shtml |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086 |pmid=42062}}</ref> an illusion. Dennett thinks adaptationism is, in fact, the best way of uncovering constraints<!-- pretty sure we should have an article on constraints too -->.\n\nThe tenth chapter, entitled \"[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]\", is an extended [[critique]] of [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who Dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his [[popular science|popular]] writings; his \"self-styled revolutions\" against adaptationism, [[gradualism]] and other orthodox Darwinism all being false alarms. The final chapter of part II dismisses [[directed mutation]], the [[inheritance of acquired traits]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard]]'s \"[[Omega Point]]\", and insists that other controversies and hypotheses  (like the [[unit of selection]] and [[Panspermia]]) have no dire consequences for orthodox Darwinism.\n\n===Part III: Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality===\n[[Image:Leviathan.jpg|thumb|The frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', which appears at the beginning of chapter 16 \"On the Origin of Morality\".]]\n\"Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality\" is the name of Part III, which begins with a quote from Nietzsche.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality]] |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1881 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= |url= }} Translated by R. J. Hollingdale. [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982].</ref> Chapter 12, \"The Cranes of Culture\", discusses [[cultural evolution]]. It asserts that the [[meme]] has a role to play in our understanding of culture, and that it allows [[human]]s, alone among [[animal]]s, to \"transcend\" our [[gene-centered view of evolution|selfish genes]].<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> \"Losing Our Minds to Darwin\" follows, a chapter about the evolution of brains, minds and [[language]]. Dennett criticizes [[Noam Chomsky]]'s perceived resistance to the [[evolution of language]], its modeling by [[artificial intelligence]], and [[reverse engineering]].\n\nThe evolution of meaning<!-- to what can I link? maybe [[Meaning (philosophy of language)]]? --> is then discussed, and Dennett uses a series of [[thought experiment]]s to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless, algorithmic processes.\n\n[[Image:Tuerkischer schachspieler racknitz3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Von Kempelen]]'s chess automaton, discussed in chapter 15.]]\nChapter 15 asserts that [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|G\u00f6del's Theorem]] does not make certain sorts of [[artificial intelligence]] impossible. Dennett extends his criticism to [[Roger Penrose]].<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Emperor's New Mind]] |last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> The subject then moves on to the [[evolution of morality|origin and evolution of morality]], beginning with [[Thomas Hobbes]]<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]] |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Hobbes |year=1651 |publisher=Crooke |location=London |isbn= |pages= |url= }}</ref> (who Dennett calls \"the first [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]]\") and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite book |title=[[On the Genealogy of Morals]] |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1887 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages= |url= }} Translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] [New York: Vintage, 1967].</ref> He concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of [[ethics]] makes sense, though he cautions against some varieties of 'greedy ethical reductionism'. Before moving to the next chapter, he discusses some [[sociobiology]] controversies.\n\nThe penultimate chapter, entitled \"Redesigning Morality\", begins by asking if ethics can be 'naturalized'. Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing, but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems. In \"The Future of an Idea\", the book's last chapter, Dennett praises [[biodiversity]], including [[cultural diversity]]. In closing, he uses ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' as an analogy; although Darwin's idea may seem dangerous, it is actually quite beautiful.\n\n== Central concepts ==\n\n=== Design Space ===\nDennett believes there is little or no principled difference between the naturally generated products of evolution and the man-made artifacts of human creativity and culture. For this reason he indicates deliberately that the complex fruits of the tree of life are in a very meaningful sense \"designed\"&mdash;even though he does not believe evolution was guided by a higher intelligence.\n\nDennett supports using the notion of memes to better understand [[cultural evolution]]. He also believes even human creativity might operate by the Darwinian mechanism.<ref>[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/valencia.htm Could there be a Darwinian Account of Human Creativity?]</ref> This leads him to propose that the \"space\" describing biological \"design\" is connected with the space describing human culture and technology.\n\nA precise mathematical definition of Design Space is not given in ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea''. Dennett acknowledges this and admits he is offering a philosophical idea rather than a scientific formulation.<ref>[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/philbook.htm Reply to Gregory Mulhauser]</ref>\n\n=== Natural selection as an algorithm ===\nDennett describes [[natural selection]] as a substrate-neutral, mindless [[algorithm]] for moving through Design Space.\n\n=== Universal acid ===\nDennett writes about the fantasy of a [[alkahest|\"universal acid\"]] as a liquid that is so corrosive that it would eat through anything that it came into contact with, even a potential container.  Such a powerful substance would transform everything it was applied to; leaving something very different in its wake.  This is where Dennett draws parallels from the \u201cuniversal acid\u201d to Darwin\u2019s idea: \n<blockquote>\n\u201cit eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognizable, but transformed in fundamental ways.\u201d\n</blockquote>\nWhile there are people who would like to see Darwin\u2019s idea contained within the field of biology, Dennett asserts that this dangerous idea inevitably \u201cleaks\u201d out to transform other fields as well.\n\n===Skyhooks and cranes===\nDennett uses the term \"skyhook\" to describe a source of design [[complexity]] that does not build on lower, simpler layers&mdash;in simple terms, a [[miracle]].\n\nIn philosophical arguments concerning the [[reduction (philosophy)|reducibility]] (or [[irreducible (philosophy)|otherwise]]) of the human mind, Dennett's concept pokes fun at the idea of [[intelligent design]] emanating from on high, either originating from one or more [[god]]s, or providing its own grounds in an absurd, [[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]]-like [[bootstrapping]] manner.\n\nDennett also accuses various competing [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] ideas of making use of such supposedly unscientific skyhooks in explaining [[evolution]], coming down particularly hard on the ideas of [[Stephen Jay Gould]].\n\nDennett contrasts theories of complexity that require such miracles with those based on \"[[crane (machine)|crane]]s\", structures that permit the construction of entities of greater complexity but are themselves founded solidly \"on the ground\" of physical science.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[John Maynard Smith]] praised ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'':\n\n<blockquote>\nIt is therefore a pleasure to meet a philosopher who understands what Darwinism is about, and approves of it.\nDennett goes well beyond biology. He sees Darwinism as a corrosive acid, capable of dissolving our earlier belief and forcing a reconsideration of much of sociology and philosophy. Although modestly written, this is not a modest book. Dennett argues that, if we understand ''Darwin's dangerous idea'', we are forced to reject or modify much of our current intellectual baggage...<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1703 New York Review of Books: John Maynard Smith \"Genes, Memes, & Minds\", 1995]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWriting in the same publication, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'' for being an \"influential but misguided ultra-Darwinian manifesto\":\n\n<blockquote>Daniel Dennett devotes the longest chapter in ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'' to an excoriating caricature of my ideas, all in order to bolster his defense of Darwinian fundamentalism. If an argued case can be discerned at all amid the slurs and sneers, it would have to be described as an effort to claim that I have, thanks to some literary skill, tried to raise a few piddling, insignificant, and basically conventional ideas to \"revolutionary\" status, challenging what he takes to be the true Darwinian scripture. Since Dennett shows so little understanding of evolutionary theory beyond natural selection, his critique of my work amounts to little more than sniping at false targets of his own construction. He never deals with my ideas as such, but proceeds by hint, innuendo, false attribution, and error.<ref name=\"gould\">[http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/Gould.html Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>\n\nGould was also a harsh critic of Dennett's idea of the \"universal [[acid]]\" of natural selection and of his subscription to the idea of [[memetics]]; Dennett responded, and the exchange between Dennett, Gould, and [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]] was printed in the ''New York Review of Books''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1096 |author= Stephen Jay Gould, Daniel Dennett | title= 'Darwinian Fundamentalism': An Exchange |year= 1997}}</ref>\n\nBiologist [[H.

He seeks beautiful mathematical patterns, beautiful explanations, beautiful typefaces, beautiful sonic patterns in poetry, ''etc''. Hofstadter has said of himself, \"I'm someone who has one foot in the world of humanities and arts, and the other foot in the world of science.\" He has had several exhibitions of his artworks in various university art galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his [[ambigrams]] (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by \"oscillation\", like the [[Necker Cube]] or the [[Optical illusion#Explanation of cognitive illusions|rabbit/duck figure]] of [[Joseph Jastrow]]), and his \"Whirly Art\" (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). (Hofstadter invented the term \"ambigram\" in 1984; many ambigrammists all over the world have since taken up the concept.)<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/~mumukshu/gandhi/gandhi/hofstadter.htm Sounds like Bach] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013202016/http://www.unc.edu/~mumukshu/gandhi/gandhi/hofstadter.htm |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), \"bon mots\" (spontaneous humorous quips), and analogies of all sorts, and his long-time observation of these diverse products of cognition, and his theories about the mechanisms that underlie them, have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models developed by himself and FARG members.<ref>\nHofstadter, Douglas, To Err is Human; to Study Error-making is Cognitive Science. Together with David Moser. ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', Vol. XXVIII, No. 2, 1989, pp. 185\u2013215.</ref>\n\nAll FARG computational models share certain key principles, including:\n\n* that human thinking is carried out by thousands of independent small actions in parallel, biased by the concepts that are currently activated\n* that activation spreads from activated concepts to less activated \"neighbor concepts\"\n* that there is a \"mental temperature\" that regulates the degree of randomness in the parallel activity\n* that promising avenues tend to be explored more rapidly than unpromising ones\n\nFARG models also have an overarching philosophy that all cognition is built from the making of analogies. The computational architectures that share these precepts are called \"active symbols\" architectures.\n\nHofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]'' (''GEB'') but also present in several of his later books, is that it is an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain. In ''GEB'' he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent \"colony\" of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an \"I\" comes from the abstract pattern he terms a \"[[strange loop]]\", which is an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as [[Audio feedback|audio]] and [[Optical feedback|video feedback]], and which Hofstadter has defined as \"a level-crossing feedback loop\". The prototypical example of this abstract notion is the self-referential structure at the core of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]. Hofstadter's 2007 book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human \"I\" is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to precisely one brain.<ref>\n[http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html Consciousness In The Cosmos: Perspective of Mind: Douglas Hofstadter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804052510/http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html |date=August 4, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHofstadter's writing is characterized by an intense interaction between form and content, as exemplified by the 20 dialogues in ''GEB'', many of which simultaneously talk about and imitate strict musical forms used by Bach, such as canons and fugues. Most of Hofstadter's books feature some kind of structural alternation: in ''GEB'' between dialogues and chapters, in ''The Mind's I'' between selections and reflections, in ''Metamagical Themas'' between Chapters and Postscripts, and so forth. Both in his writing and in his teaching, Hofstadter stresses the concrete, constantly using examples and analogies, and avoids the abstract. Typical of the courses he teaches is his seminar \"[[Group Theory]] and [[Galois Theory]] Visualized\", in which abstract mathematical ideas are rendered as concretely as possible. He puts great effort into making ideas clear and visual, and asserts that when he teaches, if his students do not understand something, it is never their fault but always his own.\n\nHofstadter is passionate about languages. In addition to English, his mother tongue, he speaks French and Italian fluently (the language spoken at home with his children is Italian). At various times in his life, he has studied (in descending order of level of fluency reached) German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Mandarin, Dutch, Polish, and Hindi.{{Citation needed|reason=See discussion page about his Russian.|date=June 2010}} His love of sounds pushes him to strive to minimize, and ideally get rid of, any foreign accent.\n\n''[[Le Ton beau de Marot|Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language]]'' is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of some 88 translations of \"Ma Mignonne\", a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]]. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as \"[[pi]]lingual\" (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he's studied comes to 3.14159&nbsp;...), as well as an \"oligoglot\" (someone who speaks \"a few\" languages).<ref>\nHofstadter, Douglas R.

Hofstadter has translated many other poems too (always respecting their formal constraints), and two novels (in prose): ''[[La chamade|La Chamade]]'' (''That Mad Ache'') by French writer [[Fran\u00e7oise Sagan]], and ''La Scoperta dell'Alba'' (''The Discovery of Dawn'') by [[Walter Veltroni]], the then head of the Partito Democratico in Italy.

Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the [[Fon people]] in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast.\n\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Kingdom of Dahomey was a key regional state, eventually ending tributary status to the [[Oyo Empire]].<ref name=Heywood>{{cite book|title=Soundings in Atlantic history: latent structures and intellectual currents, 1500\u20131830|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Heywood, Linda M.|author2=John K.

They traded prisoners, which they captured during wars and raids, and exchanged them with Europeans for goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms, fabrics, and spirits.\n\n==Name==\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was referred to by many different names and has been written in a variety of ways, including ''Danxome'', ''Danhome'', and ''Fon''.  The name ''Fon'' relates to the dominant ethnic and language group, the [[Fon people]], of the royal families of the kingdom and is how the kingdom first became known to Europeans.  The names ''Dahomey'', ''Danxome'', and ''Danhome'' all have a similar origin story, which historian Edna Bay says may be a [[false etymology]].<ref name=Bay-1998>{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref>\n\nThe story goes that [[Dakodonu]], considered the second king in modern kings lists, was granted permission by the Gedevi chiefs, the local rulers, to settle in the [[Abomey plateau]].  Dakodonu requested additional land from a prominent chief named Dan (or Da) to which the chief responded sarcastically \"Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it?\" For this insult, Dakodonu killed Dan and began the construction of his palace on the spot.

The foundational king for Dahomey is often considered to be [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685), who built the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]] and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey plateau.<ref name=Bay-1998 />\n\n=== Kings of Dahomey<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Benin|last=|first=|last2=|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8108-7373-5|editor-last=Houngnikpo|editor-first=Mathurin C.|location=|pages=131|editor-last2=Decalo|editor-first2=Samuel}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!King\n!Start of Rule\n!End of Rule\n|-\n|Ganyihessou\n|1620\n|\n|-\n|Dakodonou\n|1620\n|1645\n|-\n|Hou\u00e9gbadja\n|1645\n|1680\n|-\n|Akaba\n|1680\n|1708\n|-\n|Agaja\n|1708\n|1740\n|-\n|Tegbesu (Tegbessou)\n|1740\n|1774\n|-\n|Kpengla\n|1774\n|1789\n|-\n|Agonglo\n|1790\n|1797\n|-\n|Adandozan\n|1797\n|1818\n|-\n|Gu\u00e9zo\n|1818\n|1858\n|-\n|Gl\u00e8l\u00e8\n|1858\n|1889\n|-\n|B\u00e9hanzin\n|1889\n|1894\n|-\n|Agoli-Agbo\n|1894\n|1900\n|}\n[[File:Victims for sacrifice-1793.jpg|thumb|250px|\"Victims for sacrifice\" \u2013 from ''[[Archibald Dalzel|The history of Dahomy, an inland Kingdom of Africa]]'', 1793.]]\n\n===Rule of Agaja (1708\u20131740)===\n[[Agaja|King Agaja]], Houegbadja's grandson, came to the throne in 1708 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey. This expansion was made possible by the superior military force of King Agaja's Dahomey. In contrast to surrounding regions, Dahomey employed a professional standing army numbering around ten thousand.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Diligent|last = Harms|first = Robert|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2002|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 172}}</ref> What the Dahomey lacked in numbers, they made up for in discipline and superior arms. In 1724, Agaja conquered [[Allada]], the origin for the royal family according to oral tradition, and in 1727 he conquered [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]]. This increased size of the kingdom, particularly along the Atlantic coast, and increased power made Dahomey into a regional power. The result was near constant warfare with the main regional state, the [[Oyo Empire]], from 1728 until 1740.<ref name=Alpern>{{cite journal|last=Alpern|first=Stanley B.|title=On the Origins of the Amazons of Dahomey|journal=History in Africa|year=1998|volume=25|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.2307/3172178}}</ref>  The warfare with the Oyo empire resulted in Dahomey assuming a [[Tributary state|tributary]] status to the Oyo empire.<ref name=Law-1986>{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=Dahomey and the Slave Trade: Reflections on the Historiography of the Rise of Dahomey|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1986|volume=27|issue=2|pages=237\u2013267|doi=10.1017/s0021853700036665}}</ref>\n\n===Rule of Tegbesu (1740\u20131774)===\nTegbesu, also spelled as Tegbessou, was King of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbesu was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718\u20131740), but was selected following his father's death after winning a succession struggle with a brother. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent and regional opposition. Tegbessou ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those who it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom. The slave trade increased significantly during Tegbessou's reign and began to provide the largest part of the income for the king. In addition, Tegbesu's rule is the one with the first significant kpojito or mother of the leopard with Hwanjile in that role. The kpojito became a prominently important person in Dahomey royalty. Hwanjile, in particular, is said to have changed dramatically the religious practices of Dahomey by creating two new deities and more closely tying worship to that of the king.  According to one oral tradition, as part of the tribute owed by Dahomey to Oyo, Agaja had to give to Oyo one of his sons. The story claims that only Hwanjile, of all of Agaja's wives, was willing to allow her son to go to Oyo. This act of sacrifice, according to the oral tradition made Tegbesu, was favored by Agaja. Agaja reportedly told Tegbesu that he was the future king, but his brother Zinga was still the official heir.<ref>{{ Cite book|title= Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|last = Bay|first = Edna|publisher = University of Virginia Press|year = 1998}}</ref>\n\n===End of the kingdom===\nThe kingdom fought the [[First Franco-Dahomean War]] and [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] with France. The kingdom was reduced and made a French [[protectorate]] in 1894.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/1157517 | volume=29 | title=A Note on the Abomey Protectorate | journal=Africa | pages=146\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nIn 1904 the area became part of a French colony, [[French Dahomey]].\n\nIn 1958 [[French Dahomey]] became the self-governing colony called the [[Republic of Dahomey]] and gained full independence in 1960. It was renamed in 1975 the [[People's Republic of Benin]], and in 1991 the [[Republic of Benin]]. The Dahomey kingship exists as a ceremonial role to this day.\n\n==Politics==\nEarly writings, predominantly written by European slave traders, often presented the kingdom as an [[absolute monarchy]] led by a [[Despotism|despotic king]]. However, these depictions were often deployed as arguments by different sides in the slave trade debates, mainly in the United Kingdom, and as such were probably exaggerations.<ref name=Bay-1998 /><ref name=Law-1986 />  Recent historical work has emphasized the limits of monarchical power in the Kingdom of Dahomey.<ref name=Monroe />  Historian John C. Yoder, with attention to the Great Council in the kingdom, argued that its activities do not \"imply that Dahomey's government was democratic or even that her politics approximated those of nineteenth-century European monarchies. However, such evidence does support the thesis that governmental decisions were molded by conscious responses to internal political pressures as well as by executive fiat.\"<ref name=Yoder>{{cite journal|last=Yoder|first=John C.|title=Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1974|volume=15|issue=3|pages=417\u2013432|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013566}}</ref> The primary political divisions revolved around villages with chiefs and administrative posts appointed by the king and acting as his representatives to adjudicate disputes in the village.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" />\n\n===The king===\n{{main|King of Dahomey}}\n[[File:Gezo (2).jpg|thumbnail|King [[Ghezo]] displayed with a royal umbrella.]]\nThe King of Dahomey (''Ahosu'' in the Fon language) was the [[Sovereignty|sovereign power]] of the kingdom. All of the kings were claimed to be part of the ''Alladaxonou'' dynasty, claiming descent from the royal family in [[Allada]]. Much of the succession rules and administrative structures were created early by [[Houegbadja]], [[Akaba of Dahomey|Akaba]], and [[Agaja]]. Succession through the male members of the line was the norm typically going to the oldest son, but not always.<ref name=Law-1997>{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=The Politics of Commercial Transition: Factional Conflict in Dahomey in the Context of the Ending of the Atlantic Slave Trade|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1997|volume=38|issue=2|pages=213\u2013233|doi=10.1017/s0021853796006846|url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/280/1/politics-of-commercial-transition.pdf}}</ref> The king was selected largely through discussion and decision in the meetings of the Great Council, although how this operated was not always clear.<ref name=Bay-1998 /><ref name=Yoder /> The Great Council brought together a host of different dignitaries from throughout the kingdom yearly to meet at the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]]. Discussions would be lengthy and included members, both men and women, from throughout the kingdom. At the end of the discussions, the king would declare the consensus for the group.<ref name=Yoder />\n\n===The royal court===\nKey positions in the King's court included the ''migan'', the ''mehu'', the ''yovogan'', the ''kpojito'' (or queen-mother), and later the ''chacha'' (or viceroy) of Whydah.  The ''migan'' (combination of mi-our and gan-chief) was a primary consul for the king, a key judicial figure, and served as the head executioner. The ''mehu'' was similarly a key administrative officer who managed the palaces and the affairs of the royal family, economic matters, and the areas to the south of Allada (making the position key to contact with Europeans).\n\n===Relations with other states===\nThe relations between Dahomey and other countries were complex and heavily impacted by the Gold trade.  The [[Oyo empire]] engaged in regular warfare with the kingdom of Dahomey and Dahomey was a tributary to Oyo from 1732 until 1823. The city-state of [[Porto-Novo]], under the protection of Oyo, and Dahomey had a long-standing rivalry largely over control of the Gold trade along the coast. The rise of [[Abeokuta]] in the 1840s created another power rivaling Dahomey, largely by creating a safe haven for people from the slave trade.\n\nThe last known slave ship that sailed to the United States of America to port in Mobile, Alabama brought a group of 110 slaves from the Dahomey Kingdom, purchased long after the abolition of the international slave trade. [[Thomas Jefferson]] signed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]]  into law on March 2, effective January 1, 1808.<ref name=\"States1850\">{{cite book|author=United States|title=The Public Statutes at Large of the United States of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BkuAAAAIAAJ|year=1850|publisher=Charle C. Little and James Brown|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9BkuAAAAIAAJ 426]\u2013430}}</ref> The story was mentioned in the newspaper ''The Tarboro Southerner'' on July 14, 1860. On July 9, 1860, a schooner called ''Clotilda'', captained by William Foster, arrived in the bay of Mobile, Alabama carrying the last known shipment of slaves to the US from the Dahomey Kingdom. In 1858, a man known as Captain Timothy Meaher made a wager with acquaintances that despite the law banning the slave trade, he could safely bring a load of slaves from Africa.\n\nDescribing how he came in possession of the slaves, Captain William Foster wrote in his journal in 1860, \"from thence I went to see the King of Dahomey. Having agreeably transacted affairs with the Prince we went to the warehouse where they had in confinement four thousand captives in a state of nudity from which they gave me liberty to select one hundred and twenty-five as mine offering to brand them for me, from which I preemptorily [''sic''] forbid; commenced taking on cargo of negroes [''sic''], successfully securing on board one hundred and ten.\"\n\nA notable descendant of a slave from this ship is [[Ahmir Khalib Thompson]] (American music artist known as Questlove). Mr. Thompson's story is depicted in the PBS Television show ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'' [Season 4, Episode 9].<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 4 Episode Guide {{!}} About {{!}} Finding Your Roots|url=http://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/about/season-4-episode-guide/|website=pbs.org|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Military==\nThe military of the Kingdom of Dahomey was divided into two units: the right and the left.  The right was controlled by the ''migan'' and the left was controlled by the ''mehu''.  At least by the time of [[Agaja]], the kingdom had developed a [[standing army]] that remained encamped wherever the king was. Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, initially serving as shield carriers for regular soldiers. After years of [[apprenticeship]] and military experience, they were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers. To further incentivize the soldiers, each soldier received bonuses paid in cowry shells for each enemy they killed or captured in battle. This combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives resulted in a cohesive, well-disciplined military.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Diligent|last = Harms|first = Robert|publisher = Basic Books|year = 2002|isbn = 0-465-02872-1|location = New York|pages = 172}}</ref> One European said Agaja's standing army consisted of \"elite troops, brave and well-disciplined, led by a prince full of valor and prudence, supported by a staff of experienced officers\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Voyage du chevalier Des Marchais|last = Labat|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = I:XII}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to being well-trained, the Dahomey army under Agaja was also very well armed. The Dahomey army favored imported European weapons as opposed to traditional weapons. For example, they used European [[flintlock]] [[musket]]s in long range combat and imported steel swords and cutlasses in close combat. The Dahomey army also possessed twenty-five cannons.\n\nWhen going into battle, the king would take a secondary position to the field commander with the reason given that if any spirit were to punish the commander for decisions it should not be the king.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" /> Unlike other regional powers, the military of Dahomey did not have a significant cavalry (like the Oyo empire) or naval power (which prevented expansion along the coast). The Dahomey Amazons, a unit of all-female soldiers, is one of the most unusual aspects of the military of the kingdom.\n\n===Dahomey Amazons===\n{{main |Dahomey Amazons}}\n[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|thumb|Dahomey female soldiers.]]\nThe Dahomean state became widely known for its corps of female soldiers.

The women reportedly behaved so courageously they became a permanent corps. In the beginning, the soldiers were criminals pressed into service rather than being executed. Eventually, however, the corps became respected enough that King [[Ghezo]] ordered every family to send him their daughters, with the fittest being chosen as soldiers.{{dubious|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe economic structure of the kingdom was highly intertwined with the political and religious systems and these developed together significantly.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\">{{cite book|last=Herskovits|first=Melville J.|title=Dahomey: An Ancient West African Kingdom|year=1967|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston, IL|edition=Volume I}}</ref> The main currency was [[cowry]] shells.\n\n===Domestic economy===\nThe domestic economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption. Until the development of palm oil, very little agricultural or craft goods were traded outside of the kingdom. Markets served a key role in the kingdom and were organized around a rotating cycle of four days with a different market each day (the market type for the day was religiously sanctioned).<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" />  Agriculture work was largely decentralized and done by most families.

Then the king set a tax based upon the level of production and village population. In addition, the king's own land and production were taxed.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" /> After significant road construction undertaken by the kingdom, toll booths were also established that collected yearly taxes based on the goods people carried and their occupation.

These included royal ancestor worship and the specific [[West African Vodun|vodun]] practices of the kingdom.\n\n===Royal ancestor worship===\n{{main|Annual Customs of Dahomey}}\nEarly kings established clear worship of royal ancestors and centralized their ceremonies in the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]].  The spirits of the kings had an exalted position in the land of the dead and it was necessary to get their permission for many activities on earth.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" />   Ancestor worship pre-existed the kingdom of Dahomey; however, under King Agaja, a cycle of ritual was created centered on first celebrating the ancestors of the king and then celebrating a family lineage.<ref name=Monroe />\n\nThe Annual Customs of Dahomey (''xwetanu'' or ''huetanu'' in Fon) involved multiple elaborate components and some aspects may have been added in the 19th century.  In general, the celebration involved distribution of gifts, [[human sacrifice]], military parades, and political councils.  Its main religious aspect was to offer thanks and gain the approval for ancestors of the royal lineage.<ref name=Monroe /> However, the custom also included military parades, public discussions, gift giving (the distribution of money to and from the king), and human sacrifice and the spilling of blood.<ref name=Monroe />\n\nHuman sacrifice was an important part of the practice. During the Annual Custom, 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. In addition, when a ruler died, hundreds, to thousands of prisoners would be sacrificed. As many as 4,000 were reported killed In one of these ceremonies in 1727.<ref>R.

Oral history recounted that [[Hwanjile]], a wife of [[Agaja]] and mother of [[Tegbessou]], brought Vodun to the kingdom and ensured its spread.  The primary deity is the combined Mawu-Lisa (Mawu having female characteristics and Lisa having male characteristics) and it is claimed that this god took over the world that was created by their mother Nana-Buluku.<ref name=\"Herskovits (Vol. I)\" />  Mawu-Lisa governs the sky and is the highest pantheon of gods, but other gods exist in the earth and in thunder.  Religious practice organized different priesthoods and shrines for each different god and each different pantheon (sky, earth or thunder).  Women made up a significant amount of the priest class and the chief priest was always a descendent of [[Dakodonou]].<ref name=Bay-1998 />\n\n==Arts==\n[[File:Homme-requin Dahomey.jpg|thumbnail|Zoomorphic representation of B\u00e9hanzin as a shark.]]\nThe arts in Dahomey were unique and distinct from the [[African art|artistic traditions]] elsewhere in Africa.  The arts were substantially supported by the king and his family, had non-religious traditions, assembled multiple different materials, and borrowed widely from other peoples in the region.  Common art forms included wood and ivory carving, metalwork (including silver, iron and brass, [[appliqu\u00e9]] cloth, and clay [[bas-reliefs]].<ref name=Blier-1988 />\n\nThe king was key in supporting the arts and many of them provided significant sums for artists resulting in the unique development, for the region, of a non-religious artistic tradition in the kingdom.<ref name=Livingston />  Artists were not of a specific class but both royalty and commoners made important artistic contributions.<ref name=Blier-1988>{{cite journal|last=Blier|first=Suzanne Preston|title=Melville J.

[[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] of different components and 2. Borrowing from other states.  Assemblage of art, involving the combination of multiple components (often of different materials) combined together in a single piece of art, was common in all forms and was the result of the various kings promoting finished products rather than particular styles.<ref name=Blier-1988 />  This assembling may have been a result of the second feature, which involved the wide borrowing of styles and techniques from other cultures and states. Clothing, cloth work, architecture, and the other forms of art all resemble other artistic representation from around the region.<ref name=Blier-2004>{{cite journal|last=Blier|first=Suzanne Preston|title=The Art of Assemblage: Aesthetic Expression and Social Experience in Danhome|journal=Res: Anthropology and Aesthetics|year=2004|issue=45|pages=186\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the art work revolved around the royalty.

Historical themes dominated representation and characters were basically designed and often assembled on top of each other or in close proximity creating an ensemble effect.<ref name=Livingston />  In addition to the royal depictions in the reliefs, royal members were depicted in power sculptures known as ''bocio'', which incorporated mixed materials (including metal, wood, beads, cloth, fur, feathers, and bone) onto a base forming a standing figure.  The bocio are religiously designed to include different forces together to unlock powerful forces.<ref name=Blier-2004 />  In addition, the cloth [[appliqu\u00e9]] of Dahomey depicted royalty often in similar zoomorphic representation and dealt with matters similar to the reliefs, often the kings leading during warfare.<ref name=Livingston />\n\nDahomey had a distinctive tradition of casting small brass figures of animals or people, which were worn as jewellery or displayed in the homes of the relatively well-off.

''[[In Dahomey]]'' (1903) was a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century. Novelist [[Paul Hazoum\u00e9|Paul Hazoum\u00e9's]] first novel ''Doguicimi'' (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during the reign of King [[Ghezo]]. The anthropologist Judith Gleason wrote a novel, ''Ag\u00f5t\u0129me: Her Legend'' (1970), centered on one of the wives of a king of Dahomey in the late 18th century, who offends her husband who sells her to slavery in Brazil; she makes a bargain with a ''vodu'' (deity), putting her son on the throne of Dahomey and bringing her home. Another novel tracing the background of a slave, this time in the United States, was ''The Dahomean'', or ''The Man from Dahomey'' (1971), by the African-American novelist [[Frank Yerby]]; its hero is an aristocratic warrior. In the third of George McDonald Fraser's [[The Flashman Papers|Flashman]] novels, ''Flash for Freedom'' (1971), Flashman dabbles in the slave trade and visits Dahomey. ''[[The Viceroy of Ouidah]]'' (1980) by [[Bruce Chatwin]] is the story of a Brazilian who, hoping to make his fortune from slave trading, sails to Dahomey in 1812, befriending its unbalanced king and coming to a bad end. The book was later adapted into the film ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987) directed by [[Werner Herzog]]. The main character of one of the two parallel stories in ''Will Do Magic for Small Change'' (2016) by [[Andrea Hairston]] is Kehinde, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] woman forced into the Dahomean army; she struggles with divided loyalty, and after the fall of Behanzin, joins a French entertainment troupe who intend to exhibit her as an Amazon at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]].\n\nBehanzin's resistance to the French attempt to end slave trading and human sacrifice has been central to a number of works. [[Jean Pliya|Jean Pliya's]] first play ''Kondo le requin'' (1967), winner of the Grand Prize for African History Literature, tells the story of Behanzin's struggle to maintain the old order. [[Maryse Cond\u00e9|Maryse Cond\u00e9's]] novel ''The Last of the African Kings'' (1992) similarly focuses on Behanzin's resistance and his exile to the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African Literature|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|edition=Gikandi, Simon}}</ref> The novel ''Thread of Gold Beads'' (2012) by Nike Campbell-Fatoki centers on a daughter of Behanzin; through her eyes, the end of his reign is observed.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Traditional African religion}}\n* [[Ashanti people]]\n* [[Blockade of Africa]]\n* [[Visesegan]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Alpern |first=Stanley B. |title=Amazons of Black Sparta: The Women Warriors of Dahomey |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8147-0678-9}} In-depth description of the fighting methods of these warriors.\n*{{cite book |last=Bay|first=Edna G.|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8139-1792-4 }} A historical study of how royal power maintained itself in Dahomey.

In 1552 [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Prince Alexander of Parma]] mounted several companies of infantry on [[pack horse]]s to achieve surprise.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\" /> Another early instance was ordered by [[Louis of Nassau]] in 1572 during operations near [[Mons]] in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], when 500 infantry were transported this way.<ref name=\"p. 330, Bismark\">p. 330, Bismark</ref>  It is also suggested the first dragoons were raised by the Marshal [[Duke of Brissac|de Brissac]] in 1600.<ref>p. 331, Bismark</ref> According to old German literature, dragoons were invented by Count [[Ernst von Mansfeld]], one of the greatest German military commanders, in the early 1620s. There are other instances of mounted infantry predating this. However Mansfeld, who had learned his profession in Hungary and the Netherlands, often used horses to make his foot troops more mobile, creating what was called an \"arm\u00e9e volante\" ([[French Language|French]] for ''flying army'').\n\nThe name possibly derives from an early weapon, a short [[wheellock]] called a ''dragon'', because the first dragoons raised in France had their carbine's muzzle decorated with a dragon's head. The practice comes from a time when all gunpowder weapons had distinctive names, including the [[culverin]], serpentine, falcon, [[falconet (cannon)|falconet]], etc.<ref>p. 333, Bismark</ref>  It is also sometimes claimed a galloping infantryman with his loose coat and the burning match resembled a [[dragon]].<ref>p. 48, A Dictionary of Military Uniform W. Y. Carman {{ISBN|0-684-15130-8}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been suggested that the name derives from the German \"tragen\" or the Dutch \"dragen\", both being the verb \"to carry\" in their respective languages. [[Howard Reid (filmmaker)]] claims that the name and role descend from the Latin [[Draconarius]].<ref>p96, Arthur the Dragon King \u2013 The Barbaric Roots of Britain's Greatest Legend, Howard Reid, {{ISBN|0-7472-7558-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Use as a verb ===\nDragoon is occasionally used as a verb to mean to subjugate or persecute by the imposition of troops; and by extension to compel by any violent measures or threats. The term dates from 1689, at a time when dragoons were being used by [[Louis XIV|the French monarchy]] to [[Edict of Fontainebleau|persecute Protestants]], particularly by forcing [[Protestants]] to lodge a dragoon in their house to watch over them, at the householder's expense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/dragoon|title=the definition of dragoon|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early history and role ==\n\nEarly dragoons were not organized in [[squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]] or [[troop]]s as were cavalry, but in [[company (military unit)|companies]] like the infantry: their [[commissioned officer|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s bore infantry ranks. Dragoon regiments used  drummers, not buglers, to communicate orders on the battlefield. The flexibility of mounted infantry made dragoons a useful arm, especially when employed for what would now be termed \"[[internal security]]\" against smugglers or civil unrest, and on [[line of communication]] security duties. During the [[English Civil War]] dragoons were used for a variety of tasks: providing outposts, holding defiles or bridges in the front or rear of the main army, lining hedges or holding enclosures, and providing dismounted musketeers to support regular cavalry.<ref>Peter Young & Richard Holmes, page 42 \"The English Civil War\", {{ISBN|1-84022-222-0}}</ref>. In the closing stages of the [[Battle of Naseby]] [[Okey's Dragoons]], who had started the action as dismounted musketeers, got on their horses and charged, possibly the first time this was done. Supplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to recruit and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry.  When in the 17th century [[Gustav II Adolf]] introduced dragoons into the Swedish Army, he provided them with a sabre, an axe and a [[matchlock]] musket, utilizing them as \"labourers on horseback\".<ref>Richard Brzezinski, page 16  \"The Army of Gustavus Adolphus 2 - \", {{ISBN|1-85532-350-8}}</ref>  Many of the European armies henceforth imitated this all-purpose set of weaponry.\n\nA non-military use of dragoons was the 1681 [[Dragonnades]], a policy instituted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to intimidate [[Huguenot]] families into either leaving France or re-converting to [[Catholicism]] by [[billeting]] ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households. While other categories of infantry and cavalry were also used, the mobility, flexibility and available numbers of the dragoon regiments made them particularly suitable for repressive work of this nature over a wide area.\n\nIn the Spanish Army, Pedro de la Puente organized a body of dragoons in [[Innsbruck]] in 1635. In 1640, a [[tercio]] of a thousand dragoons armed with the [[arquebus]] was created in Spain. By the end of the 17th century, the Spanish Army had three tercios of dragoons in Spain, plus three in the [[Netherlands]] and three more in [[Milan]]. In 1704, the Spanish dragoons were reorganised into [[regiment]]s by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], as were the rest of the tercios.\n\nTowards the end of 1776, [[George Washington]] realized the need for a mounted branch of the American military.  In January 1777 four regiments of light dragoons were raised.  Short term enlistments were abandoned and the dragoons joined for three years, or \"the war\".  They participated in most of the major engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], including the Battles of [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]], [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], as well as the [[Yorktown campaign]].\n\nDragoons were at a disadvantage when engaged against true cavalry, and constantly sought to improve their horsemanship, armament and social status. By the [[Seven Years' War]] the primary role of dragoons in most European armies had progressed from that of mounted infantry to that of heavy cavalry.<ref>Dragoons are sometimes described as 'medium' cavalry, midway between heavy/armoured and light regiments, though this was a classification that was rarely given at the time. page 19 \"Napoleonic Cavalry\", Philip Haythornthwaite, {{ISBN|0-304-35508-9}}</ref> Earlier dragoon responsibilities for scouting and [[picket (military)|picket]] duty had  passed to [[hussars]] and similar light cavalry corps in the French, Austrian, Prussian, and other armies. In the [[Imperial Russian Army]], due to the availability of the [[Cossack]] troops, the dragoons were retained in their original role for much longer.\n\nAn exception to the rule was the British Army. To reduce military budgets, all horse (cavalry) regiments were gradually demoted to dragoons from 1746 onward \u2014 which meant they were paid on a lower scale. When this was completed in 1788, the heavy cavalry regiments had become either [[Dragoon Guards]] or Heavy Dragoons (depending on their precedence). The designation of Dragoon Guards did not mean that these regiments (the former 2nd to 8th Horse) had become Household Troops, but simply that they had been given a more dignified title to compensate for the loss of pay and prestige.<ref>Michael Barthorp, page 22 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>  Starting in 1756, seven regiments of Light Dragoons were raised. These Light Dragoons were trained in [[reconnaissance]], [[skirmish]]ing and other work requiring [[Endurance riding|endurance]] in accordance with contemporary standards of light cavalry performance. The success of this new class of cavalry was such that eight regular Dragoon regiments were converted to Light Dragoons between 1768 and 1783.<ref>page 24 \"British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660\", Michael Barthorp, {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n[[File:Helm eines k.u.k.

Dragoons rode larger horses than the light cavalry and wielded straight, rather than curved swords.

In 1803, the regiments of dragoons began to be called light cavalry (C''azadores'') and dragoons disappeared from the Spanish Army shortly after 1815.\n\nIn [[New Spain]], soon to be [[M\u00e9xico]], dragoons were important and elite units of the Royal Army. A number of dragoons became important military and political figures, among them [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]], members of the Queen's Regiment of Dragoons who defected and then initiated [[Mexican War of Independence|the independence movement in M\u00e9xico]] in 1810. Another important dragoon was [[Agustin de Iturbide]], who would ultimately achieve Mexican independence in 1821. He was known as the greatest horseman in M\u00e9xico and became so renowned in battle during his youth that he acquired the nickname ''El Drag\u00f3n de Hierro'' or \"The Iron Dragon\" (in Spanish, \"dragon\" and \"dragoon\" both sound and are written exactly the same). He would go on to become Agust\u00edn I, after being elected Emperor of M\u00e9xico. The political importance of dragoons during this time in the nascent country cannot be overstated.\n[[File:Battle of Resaca de la Palma.jpg|thumb|left|220px|alt=Sepia print of cavalrymen cutting with swords at foot soldiers.

For the war [[2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|a second regiment]] was activated; that regiment was consolidated with the original regiment in 1814. The original regiment was consolidated with the Corps of Artillery in June 1815.<ref name=Heitman>Heitman pp. 79\u201480</ref>\n\nThe 1st United States Dragoons explored [[Iowa]] after the [[Black Hawk Purchase]] put the area under U.S. control. In the summer of 1835, the regiment blazed a trail along the [[Des Moines river]] and established outposts from present-day [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]]. In 1933, the State of Iowa opened the [[Dragoon Trail]], a scenic and historic drive that follows the path of the 1st United States Dragoons on their historic march.\n\nIn 1861 the two existing U.S. Dragoon regiments were re-designated as the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. This reorganization did not affect their role or equipment, although the traditional orange uniform braiding of the dragoons was replaced by the standard yellow of the Cavalry branch. This marked the official end of dragoons in the U.S. Army, although certain modern units trace their origins back to the historic dragoon regiments.\n\nIn several stages between 1816 and 1861, the 21 existing Light Dragoon regiments in the British Army were disbanded or converted to [[lancer]]s or [[hussar]]s.<ref>British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660, Michael Barthorp {{ISBN|0-7137-1043-8}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1881 and 1910 all Russian cavalry (other than [[Cossacks]] and [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] regiments) were designated as dragoons, reflecting an emphasis on dismounted action in their training and a growing acceptance of the impracticality of employing historical [[cavalry tactics]] against modern firepower.\n[[File:Karlsruhe Leibdragonerdenkmal.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Baden]] dragoon in a [[World War I]] monument at [[Karlsruhe]]. While almost an  [[anachronism]] after the early stages of that war, German dragoons did see continuing service on the Eastern Front until 1917. Note the functional [[Stahlhelm]] helmet.]]\nIn [[Japan]], in the late 19th century/early 20th century, dragoons were deployed in the same way as in other armies, but were dressed as [[hussars]].\n\n== 20th century ==\nIn 1914 there were still dragoon regiments in the British, French, German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, Peruvian, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Spanish armies. Their uniforms varied greatly, lacking the characteristic features of hussar or lancer regiments. There were occasional reminders of the mounted infantry origins of this class of soldier. Thus the 28 dragoon regiments of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] wore the [[Pickelhaube]] (spiked helmet) of the same design as those of the infantry<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages =324\u2013343|title=The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=3-902526-07-6}}</ref> and the British dragoons wore scarlet tunics for full dress while hussars and all but one of the lancer regiments wore dark blue.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Barthorp|pages =183\u2013184|title=British Cavalry Uniforms Since 1660|ISBN=0-7137-1043-8}}</ref> In other respects however dragoons had adopted the same tactics, roles and equipment as other branches of the cavalry and the distinction had become simply one of traditional titles. Weaponry had ceased to have a historic connection, with both the French and German dragoon regiments carrying lances during the early stages of World War I.\n\nThe historic German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian dragoon regiments ceased to exist as distinct branches following the overthrow of the respective imperial regimes of these countries during 1917\u201318. The Spanish dragoons, which dated back to 1640, were reclassified as numbered cavalry regiments in 1931 as part of the army modernization policies of [[Spanish Republic|the new republic]].\n\nThe [[Australian Light Horse]] were similar to 18th-century dragoon regiments in some respects, being mounted infantry which normally fought on foot, their horses' purpose being transportation. They served during the [[Second Boer War]] and [[World War I]]. The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade became famous for the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] in 1917 where they charged on horseback using rifle bayonets, since neither [[sabre]]s or [[lance]]s were part of their equipment.\n\nProbably the last use of real dragoons (infantry on horseback) in combat was made by the [[Portuguese Army]] in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|war in Angola]] during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1966, the Portuguese created an experimental horse platoon, to operate against the guerrillas in the high grass region of Eastern [[Angola]], in which each soldier was armed with a [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] [[assault rifle]] for combat on foot and with an [[Semi-automatic pistol|automatic pistol]] to fire from horseback. The troops on horseback were able to operate in difficult terrain unsuited to [[motor vehicle]]s and had the advantage of being able to control the area around them, with a clear view over the grass that foot troops did not have. Moreover, these unconventional troops created a psychological impact on an enemy that was not used to facing horse troops, and thus had no training or strategy to deal with them. The experimental horse platoon was so successful that its entire parent battalion was transformed from an armored reconnaissance unit to a three-squadron horse battalion known as the \"[[Dragoons of Angola]]\". One of the typical operations carried out by the Dragoons of Angola, in cooperation with [[airmobile]] forces, consisted of the dragoons chasing the guerrillas and pushing them in one direction, with the airmobile troops being launched from [[helicopter]] in the enemy rear, trapping the enemy between the two forces.<ref>CANN, Jonh P., \"Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974\", Hailer Publishing, 2005</ref>\n\n=== Dragoner rank ===\n[[File:Dragoner des Oldenburgischen Dragoner-Regiments Nr. 19, 1870..jpg|thumb|180px|Dragoon of the Oldenburgian Dragoon Regiment Nr. 19 (in 1870)]]\nUntil 1918 '''''Dragoner''''' (en: dragoon) was the designation given to the lowest ranks in the dragoon regiments of the Austro-Hungarian and Imperial German Armies. The ''Dragoner'' rank, together with all other private ranks of the different branch of service, did belong to the so-called [[gemeine]] rank group.\n\n== Modern dragoons ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\n[[File:1352FP484.jpg|thumb|220px|Independence Day parade with the Brazilian dragoons]]\nThe [[President of Brazil|Brazilian president]]'s [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] is provided (amongst other units) by a regiment of dragoons: the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment of the [[Brazilian Army]].\n\nThis regiment is known as the \"Drag\u00f5es da Independ\u00eancia\" (Independence Dragoons). The name was given in 1927 and refers to the fact that a detachment of dragoons escorted the [[Prince Royal of Portugal]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], at the time when he [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declared Brazilian independence]] from [[Portugal]], on September 7, 1822.\n\nThe Independence Dragoons wear 19th-century dress uniforms similar to those of the earlier Imperial Honor Guard, which are used as the regimental full dress uniform since 1927. The uniform was designed by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret|Debret]], in white and red, with plumed bronze helmets. The colors and pattern were influenced by the Austrian dragoons of the period, as the [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Brazilian Empress Consort]] was also an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Archduchess]].<ref>{{cite web  |title=Ex\u00e9rcito Brasileiro \u2013 Bra\u00e7o Forte, M\u00e3o Amiga |url=http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093820/http://www.exercito.gov.br/VO/175/unifor.htm |archivedate=2009-03-12 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The color of the plumes varies according to rank.

However dragoons had existed in Portugal since at least the early 18th century and, in 1719, units of this type of cavalry were sent to Brazil, initially to escort shipments of gold and diamonds and to guard the [[Viceroy]] who resided in Rio de Janeiro (1st Cavalry Regiment \u2013 Vice-Roy Guard [[Squadron (cavalry)|Squadron]]). Later, they were also sent to the south to serve against the Spanish during frontier clashes. After the proclamation of Brazilian independence, the title of the regiment was changed to that of the Imperial Honor Guard, with the role of protecting the Imperial Family. The Guard was later disbanded by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Peter II]] and would be recreated only later in the republican era.<ref>CARVALHO, Jos\u00e9 Murilo de. D. Pedro II: Ser ou n\u00e3o ser.

Dragoons fought on horses, bicycles and skis against the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion in 1940]]. After [[World War II]] the dragoon regiments were reorganized as [[armour]]ed [[reconnaissance]] units. \"Dragon\" is the rank of a compulsory service private cavalryman while enlisted (regular) cavalrymen have the same rank as infantrymen: \"Grenader\".\n\n=== Peru ===\n[[File:Dragones del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>Changing of the dragoon guard by the Field Marshal Nieto Regiment of Cavalry, Life-Guard of the President of the Republic of Peru </center>]]\nThe [[Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment|Presidential Escort Life Guard Dragoons Regiment \"Field Marshal Domingo Nieto\"]],  named after Field Marshal [[Domingo Nieto]], of the [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of the Republic of Per\u00fa]] were the traditional Guard of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] until March 5, 1987 and its disbandment in that year. However, by Ministerial Resolution No 139-2012/DE/EP of February 2, 2012 the restoration of the Cavalry Regiment \"Marshal Domingo Nieto\" as the official escort of the President of the Republic of Peru was announced. The main mission of the reestablished regiment was to guarantee the security of the President of the Republic and of the Government Palace.\n\nThis regiment of dragoons was created in 1904 following the suggestion of a French military mission which undertook the reorganization of the [[Peruvian Army]] in 1896. The initial title of the unit was Cavalry Squadron \"President's Escort\". It was modelled on the French dragoons of the period. The unit was later renamed as the Cavalry Regiment \"President's Escort\" before receiving its current title in 1949.\n\nThe Peruvian Dragoon Guard has throughout its existence worn French-style uniforms of black tunic and red breeches in winter and white coat and red breeches in summer, with red and white plumed bronze helmets with the [[coat of arms of Peru]] and golden or red [[epaulettes]] depending on rank. They retain their original armament of [[lance]]s and [[sabre]]s, until the 1980s [[rifle]]s were used for dismounted drill.\n\nAt [[24-hour clock|13:00 hours]] every day, the main esplanade in front of the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace of Per\u00fa]] fronting Lima's Main Square serves as the stage for the changing of the guard, undertaken by members of the Presidential Life Guard Escort Dragoons, mounted or dismounted. While the dismounted changing is held on Mondays and Fridays, the mounted ceremony is held twice a month on a Sunday.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe [[Portuguese Army]] still maintains two units which are descended from former regiments of dragoons. These are the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]] Dragoons\") and the 6th Regiment of Cavalry (the former \"[[Chaves (Portugal)|Chaves]] Dragoons\"). Both regiments are, presently, armoured units. The [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade]]' Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 a unit from the 3rd Regiment of Cavalry \u2013 is known as the \"Paratroopers Dragoons\".\n\nDuring the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in the 1960s and the 1970s, the Portuguese Army created an experimental horse platoon, to combat the guerrillas in eastern [[Angola]]. This unit was soon augmented, becoming a group of three squadrons, known as the \"[[Angola Dragoons]]\". The Angola Dragoons operated as mounted infantry \u2013 like the original dragoons \u2013 each soldier being armed with a [[pistol]] to fire when on horseback and with an [[automatic rifle]], to use when dismounted. A unit of the same type was being created in [[Mozambique]] when the war ended in 1974.\n\n=== Spain ===\nSpain recreated its dragoons in the late nineteenth century. In 1930, three Spanish dragoon regiments were still in existence.<ref>Richard Knotel, pages 408-409 \"Uniforms of the World\", {{ISBN|0-684-16304-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\n{{See also|Norrlands dragonregemente}}\n\nIn the [[Swedish Army]], dragoons comprise the [[Military Police]] and Military Police Rangers. They also form the Dragoons Battalion of the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The Dragoons Battalion have roots that go back as far as 1523, making it one of the world's oldest military units still in service and the only mounted unit still retained by the Swedish Army. Horses are used for ceremonial purposes only, most often when the dragoons take part in the changing of the guards at The Royal Palace in Stockholm. \"''Livdragon''\" is the rank of a private cavalryman.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\n[[File:Dragon IMG 3508.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbine of a Swiss dragoon, with the strap system allowing a quick draw while mounted. On display at Morges military museum.]]\nIn the Swiss Army, mounted dragoons existed until the early 1970s, when they were converted into Armoured Grenadiers units. The \"''Dragoner''\" had to prove he was able to keep a horse at home before entering the army. At the end of basic training they had to buy a horse at a reduced price from the army and to take it home together with equipment, uniform and weapon. In the \"yearly repetition course\" the dragoons served with their horses, often riding from home to the meeting point.\n\nThe abolition of the dragoon units, believed to be the last non-ceremonial horse cavalry in Europe, was a contentious issue in Switzerland. On 5 December 1972 the Swiss ''[[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]]'' approved the measure by 91 votes, against 71 for retention.<ref>{{cite web |title=11214 BRG |access-date=2014-02-01 |url=http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/gesch/1972/d_gesch_19720214_620.htm |date=1972 |publisher=National Council of Switzerland}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the present-day [[British Army]] regular army, four regiments are designated as dragoons: the [[1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards]], the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]], the [[Royal Dragoon Guards]], and the [[Light Dragoons]].

Among its founders was [[Willem Usselincx]] (1567\u20131647).<ref>Franklin J. Jameson (1887). Willem Usselinx, Founder of the Dutch and Swedish West India Companies. Ryan Gregory University, New York.</ref> On June 3, 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[Dutch West Indies]] by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over Dutch participation in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[North America]]. The area where the company could operate consisted of [[West Africa]] (between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]]) and the [[Americas]], which included the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the eastern part of [[New Guinea]]. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the largely ephemeral [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]] (including [[New Netherland]]) in the seventeenth century. From 1624 to 1654, the WIC held Portuguese territory in northeast Brazil, but they were ousted from [[Dutch Brazil]] following fierce resistance.<ref>[[Charles R. Boxer]], ''The Dutch in Brazil, 1624-1654''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1957.</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Flag of the Dutch West India Company.svg|thumb|Flag of Dutch West India Company]]\n[[File:Het West Indisch Huys - Amsterdam 1655.png|thumb|200px|The West Indian Warehouse at [[Rapenburg (Amsterdam)]], constructed in 1642]]\n\nWhen the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) was founded in 1602, some traders in Amsterdam did not agree with its mono politics. With help from [[Petrus Plancius]], a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[astronomer]], [[Cartography|cartographer]] and [[clergyman]], they sought for a northeastern or northwestern access to Asia to circumvent the VOC monopoly. In 1609, English explorer [[Henry Hudson]], in employment of the VOC, landed on the coast of [[New England]] and sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River in his quest for the [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia. However, he failed to find a passage. Consequently, in 1615 [[Isaac Le Maire]] and [[Samuel Blommaert]], assisted by others, focused on finding a south-westerly route around South America's [[Tierra del Fuego]] archipelago in order to circumvent the monopoly of the VOC.\n\nOne of the first sailors who focused on trade with Africa was [[Balthazar de Moucheron]]. The trade with [[Africa]] offered several possibilities to set up trading posts or factories, an important starting point for negotiations. It was Blommaert, however, who stated that, in 1600, eight companies sailed on the coast of Africa, competing with each other for the supply of copper, from the [[Kingdom of Loango]].<ref>James LaFleur, ed. Pieter van den Broeck</ref> Pieter van den Broecke was employed by one of these companies. In 1612, a Dutch fortress was built in [[Mouree]] (present day Ghana), along the [[Dutch Gold Coast]].\n\nTrade with the [[Caribbean]], for salt, sugar and tobacco, was hampered by Spain and delayed because of peace negotiations. Spain offered peace on condition that the Dutch Republic would withdraw from trading with Asia and America. Spain refused to sign the peace treaty if a West Indian Company would be established. At this time, the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch War of Independence (1568\u20131648)]] between Spain and the Dutch Republic was occurring. [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] offered to only suspend trade with the West in exchange for the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. The result was that, during a few years, the company sailed under a foreign flag in South America. However, ten years later, [[Stadtholder]] [[Maurice of Orange]], proposed to continue the war with Spain, but also to distract attention from Spain to the Republic. In 1619, his opponent Johan van Oldenbarnevelt was beheaded, and when two years later the truce expired, the West Indian Company was established.\n\nThe West India Company received its charter from the States-General in 1621, but its foundation had been suggested much earlier in the 17th century only to be delayed by the conclusion of the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] between Spain and the United Provinces in 1609.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16253529|title=The Dutch seaborne empire, 1600-1800|last=Boxer|first=C.

Like the VOC, the WIC company had five offices, called chambers (''kamers''), in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Hoorn]], [[Middelburg]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], of which the chambers in Amsterdam and Middelburg contributed most to the company. The board consisted of 19 members, known as the Heeren XIX (the Nineteen Gentlemen).<ref name=\"WDL2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4068/ |title = Freedoms, as Given by the Council of the Nineteen of the Chartered West India Company to All those who Want to Establish a Colony in New Netherland |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1630 |accessdate = 2013-07-28 }}</ref> The institutional structure of the WIC followed the federal structure, which entailed extensive discussion for any decision, with regional representation: 8 from Amsterdam; 4 from Zeeland, 2 each from the Northern Quarter (Hoorn and Enkhuizen), the Maas (Rotterdam and Dordrecht), the region of Groningen, and one representative from the States General. Each region had its own chamber and board of directors.<ref>Michiel van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 2017, pp. 37\u201338.</ref> The validity of the charter was set at 24 years.\n\nOnly in 1623 was funding arranged, after several bidders were put under pressure. The [[States General of the Netherlands]] and the VOC pledged one million [[guilders]] in the form of capital and subsidy. Although Iberian writers said that [[crypto-Jews]] or [[Marranos]] played an important role in the formation of both the VOC and the WIC, research has shown that initially they played a minor role, but expanded during the period of the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch in Brazil]]. Emigrant [[Calvinists]] from the Spanish Netherlands did make significant investments in the WIC.<ref>[[Charles R. Boxer]], ''The Dutch in Brazil, 1724-1654''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1957, pp. 10-11.</ref> Investors did not rush to put their money in the company in 1621, but the States-General urged municipalities and other institutions to invest. Explanations for the slow investment by individuals were that shareholders had \"no control over the directors' policy and the handling of ordinary investors' money,\" that it was a \"racket\" to provide \"cushy posts for the directors and their relatives, at the expense of ordinary shareholders.\"<ref>Boxer, ''The Dutch in Brazil'', p. 12.</ref> The VOC directors invested money in the WIC, without consulting their shareholders, causing dissent among a number of shareholders.<ref>Boxer, ''The Dutch in Brazil'', pp. 12\u201313.</ref> In order to attract foreign shareholders, the WIC offered equal standing to foreign investors with Dutch, resulting in shareholders from France, Switzerland, and Venice. A translation of the original 1621 charter appeared in English, ''Orders and Articles granted by the High and Mightie Lords the States General of the United Provinces concerning the erecting of a West-Indies Companie, Anno Dom. MDCXII''.<ref>Boxer, ''The Dutch in Brazil'', p. 13.</ref> by 1623, the capital for the WIC at 2.8 million florins was not as great the VOC's original capitalization of 6.5 million, but it was still a substantial sum. The WIC had 15 ships to carry trade and plied the west African coast and Brazil.<ref>Boxer, ''The Dutch in Brazil'', pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nUnlike the VOC, the WIC had no right to deploy military troops. When the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621 was over, the Republic had a free hand to re-wage war with Spain. A ''[[Groot Desseyn]]'' (\"grand design\") was devised to seize the Portuguese colonies in Africa and the Americas, so as to dominate the sugar and slave trade. When this plan failed, [[privateering]] became one of the major goals within the WIC. The arming of merchant ships with guns and soldiers to defend themselves against Spanish ships was of great importance. On almost all ships in 1623, 40 to 50 soldiers were stationed, possibly to assist in the [[Maritime hijacking|hijacking]] of enemy ships.<ref>{{nl}}Klein, P.W. (1965) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 150.</ref> It is unclear whether the first expedition was the expedition by Jacques l'Hermite to the coast of [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], set up by Stadtholder Maurice with the support of the States General and the VOC.\n\n[[File:Piet Hein.jpg|thumb|left|[[Piet Hein (Netherlands)|Piet Heyn]], WIC admiral who captured the Spanish silver fleet in 1628.]]\nThe company was initially a dismal failure, in terms of its expensive early projects, and its directors shifted emphasis from conquest of territory to pursue plunder of shipping. The most spectacular success for the WIC was [[Piet Hein (Netherlands)|Piet Heyn]]'s seizure of the [[Spanish silver fleet]], which carried silver from Spanish colonies to Spain. He had also seized a consignment of sugar from Brazil and a galleon from Honduras with cacao, indigo, and other valuable goods. [[Privateering]] was its most profitable activity in the late 1620s.<ref>[[Jonathan I. Israel]], ''The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World, 1606-1661''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1982, p. 197.</ref> Despite Heyn's success at plunder, the company's directors realized that it was not a basis to build long-term profit, leading them to renew their attempts to seize Iberian territory in the Americas. They decided their target was Brazil.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World'', pp. 198\u201399.</ref>\n\nThere were conflicts between directors from different areas of The Netherlands, with Amsterdam less supportive of the company. Non-maritime cities, including Haarlem, Leiden, and Gouda, along with Enkhuizen and Hoorn were enthusiastic about seizing territory. They sent a fleet to Brazil, capturing [[Olinda]] and [[Pernambuco]] in 1630 in their initial foray to create a [[Dutch Brazil]], but could not hold them due to a strong Portuguese resistance.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World'', pp. 201\u201302.</ref> Company ships continued privateering in the Caribbean, as well seizing vital land resources, particularly salt pans.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World'', p. 203.</ref> The company's general lack of success saw their shares plummet and the Dutch and The Spanish renewed truce talks in 1633.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World'', p. 204.</ref>\n\nIn 1629 the WIC gave permission to a number of investors in [[New Netherland]]s to found [[patroonships]], enabled by the [[Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions]] which was ratified by the [[Dutch States-General]] on June 7, 1629. The patroonships were created to help populate the colony, by providing investors grants providing land for approximately 50 people and \"upwards of 15 years old\", per grant, mainly in the region of New Netherland.<ref name=\"WDL2\"/><ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4066/ |title = Conditions as Created by their Lords Burgomasters of Amsterdam |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1656 |accessdate = 2013-07-28 }}</ref> Patroon investors could expand the size of their land grants as large as 4 miles, \"along the shore or along one bank of a navigable river...\" [[Rensselaerswyck]] was the most successful Dutch West India Company patroonship.<ref name=\"WDL2\"/>\n\nThe New Netherland area, which included [[New Amsterdam]], covered parts of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]].<ref name=\"WDL2\"/> Other settlements were established on the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and in South America, in [[Dutch Brazil]], [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]]. In Africa, posts were established on the [[Dutch Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), the [[Dutch Slave Coast|Slave Coast]] (now [[Benin]]), and briefly in [[Angola]]. It was a neo-[[feudal system]], where patrons were permitted considerable powers to control the overseas colony. In the Americas, [[fur]] (North America) and sugar (South America) were the most important trade goods, while African settlements traded the enslaved (mainly destined for the plantations on the Antilles and Suriname), gold, and ivory.\n\n===Decline===\n\n[[File:Cidade mauricia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Recife]] or Mauritsstad&nbsp;\u2013 capital of [[Nieuw Holland]]]]\nIn North America, the settlers [[Albert Burgh]], [[Samuel Blommaert]], [[Samuel Godijn]], [[Johannes de Laet]] had little success with populating the colony of New Netherland, and to defend themselves against local Amerindians. Only [[Kiliaen van Rensselaer (merchant)|Kiliaen Van Rensselaer]] managed to maintain his settlement in the north along the Hudson. Samuel Blommaert secretly tried to secure his interests with the founding of the colony of [[New Sweden]] on behalf of Sweden on the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] in the south. The main focus of the WIC now went to Brazil.\n\nOnly in 1630 did the West India Company manage to conquer a part of Brazil. In 1630, the colony of [[Dutch Brazil|New Holland]] (capital Mauritsstad, present-day [[Recife]]) was founded, taking over [[Portugal|Portuguese]] possessions in Brazil. In the meantime, the war demanded so many of its forces that the Company had to operate under a permanent threat of bankruptcy.<ref>{{nl}}Heijer, H. den (1994) De geschiedenis van de WIC, p. 97.</ref> In fact, the WIC went bankrupt in 1636 and all attempts at rehabilitation were doomed to failure.<ref>{{nl}}Dillen, J.G. van, (1970) Van Rijkdom tot Regenten, p. 169.</ref>\n[[File:Pakhuiswic.JPG|thumb|right|Warehouse of the WIC in Amsterdam]]\nBecause of the ongoing war in Brazil, the situation for the WIC in 1645, at the end of the charter, was very bad.

Amsterdam was not willing to help out, because it had too much interest in peace and healthy trade relations with Portugal. This indifferent attitude of Amsterdam was the main cause of the slow, half-hearted policy, which would eventually lead to losing the colony.<ref>{{aut|[[Charles Ralph Boxer|Boxer, C.R.]]}} (1957) The Dutch in Brazil 1624 - 1654. Oxford, Clarendon Press. ISBN</ref> In 1647 the Company made a restart using 1.5 million guilders, capital of the VOC. The States General took responsibility for the warfare in Brazil.\n\nDue to the [[Peace of Westphalia]] the seizing of Spanish ships was no longer allowed. Many merchants from Amsterdam and [[Zeeland]] decided to work with marine and merchants from [[Hamburg]], [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]] (then [[Denmark|Danish]]), [[England]] and other countries. In 1649, the WIC obtained a monopoly on gold and enslaved Africans in the kingdom of [[Accra]] (present-day [[Ghana]]). In 1662 there were contacts with the owners of the [[Asiento]], which were obliged to deliver 24,000 enslaved Africans.<ref>{{nl}} Brakel, S. van (1918) Bescheiden over den slavenhandel der Westindische Compagnie, p. 50, 67.

(1965) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 182.</ref> The reason that the WIC could drag on for twenty years was due to its valuable [[West Africa]]n possessions, due to its slaves.\n\n==New West India Company==\n{{slavery}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n\nWhen the WIC could not repay its debts in 1674, the company was dissolved. But because of high demand for trade with the West (mainly [[slave trade]]), and the fact that still many colonies existed, it was decided to establish the Second Chartered West India Company (also called New West India Company) in 1675. This new company had the same trade area as the first. All ships, fortresses, etc. were taken over by the new company. The number of directors was reduced from 19 to 10, and the number of governors from 74 to 50. The new WIC had a capital that was slightly more than {{nowrap|6 million}} guilders around 1679, which was largely supplied by the Amsterdam Chamber.\n\nFrom 1694 until 1700, the WIC waged a long conflict against the Eguafo Kingdom along the Gold Coast, present-day [[Ghana]]. The [[Komenda Wars]] drew in significant numbers of neighbouring African kingdoms and led to replacement of the gold trade with enslaved Africans.\n\nAfter the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], it became apparent that the Dutch West India Company was no longer capable of defending its own colonies, as [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Berbice]], [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], [[Demerara]], and some forts on the Dutch Gold Coast were rapidly taken by the British. In 1791, the company's stock was bought by the Dutch government, and on 1 January 1792, all territories previously held by the Dutch West India Company reverted to the rule of the States General of the [[Dutch Republic]]. Around 1800 there was an attempt to create a third West Indian Company, without any success.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Netherlands|New York City|Suriname|Companies}}\n* [[Atlantic World]]\n*[[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)]]\n*[[List of director generals of New Netherland]]\n*[[List of trading companies]]\n*[[Atlantic slave trade]]\n*[[Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions]]\n*[[New Holland (Acadia)]]\n*[[Recapture of Bahia]]\n* [[:fr:Compagnies europ\u00e9ennes fond\u00e9es au XVIIe si\u00e8cle|European chartered companies founded around the 17th century]] (in French)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Charles R.

He is best remembered for his role as [[Lucy and Ricky Ricardo|Ricky Ricardo]] on the American television series sitcom ''[[I Love Lucy]]''. He co-starred on that show with dramatic and comedienne actress [[Lucille Ball]] (1911-1989), to whom he was married at the time. He and Ball are generally credited as the inventors of the syndicated [[rerun]], which they pioneered with the ''I Love Lucy'' series.<ref name=\"Ent 20081009\">{{cite web|title=Desi Arnaz & Lucille Ball: The Geniuses Who Shaped The Future Of Television|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197550|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=January 28, 2013|date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nArnaz and Lucille Ball cofounded and ran the television production company [[Desilu Productions]], originally to market ''I Love Lucy'' to television networks. After ''I Love Lucy'' ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently; examples of which included ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. He was also renowned for leading his Latin music band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.\n\n==Early life==\nArnaz was born Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha, III, in [[Santiago de Cuba]] to [[Desiderio Alberto Arnaz II|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Alberni II]] (March 8, 1894 \u2013 May 31, 1973) and his wife Dolores de Acha (April 2, 1896 \u2013 October 24, 1988). His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at [[Bacardi Rum]].<ref name=\"Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122\">Gjelten, Tom. ''Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba: The Biography of a Cause''. Viking Adult, 2008, p. 122 (footnote).<!-- ISSN/ISSN needed --></ref>\n\nAccording to Arnaz, in his autobiography ''A Book'' (1976), the family owned three ranches, a palatial home, and a vacation mansion on a private island in Santiago Bay, Cuba. Following the 1933 Cuban Revolution, led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf.<ref name=\"Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122\"/> The family then fled to [[Miami]], where Desi attended [[St. Patrick Catholic School (Miami Beach, Florida)|St. Patrick Catholic High School]].

Saint Leo College Press. p. 463.</ref> (near [[Tampa]]) to help improve his English.\n\n==Film career==\nWhen he moved to the United States, Desi Arnaz turned to show business to support himself. In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball eloped on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name=\"Arnaz\">Arnaz, Desi. ''A Book''. New York: William Morrow, 1976. {{ISBN|0688003427}}</ref>\n\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943). He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queens of Comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the New Generation of Funny Women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1997|isbn=9782884492447|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===''I Love Lucy''===\n[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|thumb|upright|Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, 1957]]\nOn October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''I Love Lucy'', in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique \"Ricky\" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's \"Husband\" co-star [[Richard Denning]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\". Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nInitially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.<ref name=\"title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do\">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito P\u00e9rez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.\nDuring his time on the show, he became TV's most successful entrepreneur.\n\n==Desilu Productions==\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110\u201312</ref>\n\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1968. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA60&dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.\n\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|Arnaz and Lucille Ball in Los Angeles, 1953]]\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actress [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and actor [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] (born 1953).\n\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and womanizing. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''The Mothers-in-Law'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Torero (bullfighter)|matador]], Se\u00f1or Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer. Although both Arnaz and Ball married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends, and grew closer in his final decade. \"''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title\", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.<ref>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.\n\n==Later life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]\nIn the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]]. [[Vivian Vance]] appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' special on [[NBC]] that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, ''A Book'', on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of ''I Love Lucy'' and ''The Untouchables''. The spoofs of ''I Love Lucy'' were supposed to be earlier concepts of the show that never made it on the air, such as \"I Love Louie\", where Desi lived with [[Louis Armstrong]]. He read [[Lewis Carroll]]'s poem \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it \"Habberwocky\"). Desi Jr., played the drums and, supported by the ''SNL'' band, Desi sang both \"[[Babalu (song)|Babalu]]\" and another favorite from his dance band days, \"[[Cuban Pete (song)|Cuban Pete]]\"; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on ''I Love Lucy''. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the ''SNL'' studio.\n\nArnaz and his wife eventually moved to [[Del Mar, California]], where he lived the rest of his life in semiretirement. He owned a [[horse-breeding]] farm in [[Corona, California]], and raced [[thoroughbred]]s. He contributed to charitable and nonprofit organizations, including [[San Diego State University]]. He also taught classes at San Diego State in studio production and acting for television. Arnaz made a guest appearance on the TV series ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', starring [[Linda Lavin]] and produced by ''I Love Lucy'' co-creators [[Madelyn Pugh]] (Madelyn Davis) and [[Bob Carroll, Jr.]]\n\n==Death==\nArnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of ''I Love Lucy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/Famous/g/Famous-Tobacco-Victims-Actor-Desi-Arnaz.htm|title=Famous Tobacco Victims - Desi Arnaz|author=Terry Martin|work=About.com Health}}</ref> He smoked Cuban cigars into his sixties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-03/news/mn-486_1_desi-arnaz|title=Desi Arnaz, TV Lucy's Loving Co-Star, Dies|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986. He died several months later on December 2, 1986, at the age of 69. Arnaz was cremated and his ashes scattered. His death came just five days before Ball received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]. His second wife, Edith, died a year earlier on March 23, 1985.\n\n==Legacy==\nDesi Arnaz has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures and one at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard for television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/stars?recipient=Desi+Arnaz|title=Search results for 'Desi Arnaz' |work=[[The Hollywood Walk of Fame]]}}</ref> Arnaz was never nominated for an Emmy for his performance in \u2019\u2019I Love Lucy\u2019\u2019 like his co-stars, something that remains surprising to this day. However, in 1956, Arnaz won a [[Golden Globe]] for [[13th Golden Globe Awards#Television Achievement|Best TV Show]], in honor of the work he, his colleagues, and studio had done while he served as head of production.\n\nThe [[Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center]] museum is in [[Jamestown, New York]], and the Desi Arnaz Bandshell in the Lucille Ball Memorial Park is in [[Celoron, New York]].\n\nArnaz was portrayed by [[Oscar Nu\u00f1ez]] in ''I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom'', a comedy about how Arnaz and Lucille Ball battled to get their sitcom on the air. It had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, co-starring [[Sarah Drew]] as [[Lucille Ball]], and [[Seamus Dever]] as ''I Love Lucy'' creator-producer-head writer [[Jess Oppenheimer]].

DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate.

Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity.

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range.

This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses also form icosahedral capsids.

The ''Bidnaviridae'' have a two part genome and infect invertebrates. The ''Inoviridae'' and ''Microviridae'' infect [[bacteria]]; the ''Anelloviridae'' and ''Circoviridae'' infect [[animal]]s ([[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s respectively); and the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' infect [[plant]]s. In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication. This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the host's own [[DNA polymerase]].\n\n===Recently classified viruses===\n\nIn the 9th edition of the viral taxonomy of the ICTV (published 2011) the Bombyx mori densovirus type 2 was placed in a new family\u2014the ''[[Bidnaviridae]]'' on the basis of its genome structure and replication mechanism.

There are two types of DNA satellite viruses\u2014the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s\u2014both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.\n\nAlphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the  Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=Koonin2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]-[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an Antarctic haloarchaeon uses specialized membrane vesicles to disseminate and infect plasmid-free cells | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 1446\u20131455 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28827601 | doi = 10.1038/s41564-017-0009-2 }}</ref>\n\n==NCLDVs==\n{{main|Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses}}\nThe asfarviruses, iridoviruses, mimiviruses, phycodnaviruses and poxviruses have been shown to belong to a single group,<ref name=\"Iyer2006\"/>\u2014the large nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA viruses.

The ancestral genome was complex with at least 41 genes including (1) the replication machinery (2) up to four [[RNA polymerase]] subunits (3) at least three [[transcription factor]]s (4) capping and polyadenylation enzymes (5) the DNA packaging apparatus (6) and structural components of an icosahedral capsid and the viral membrane.\n\nThe evolution of this group of viruses appears to be complex with genes having been gained from multiple sources.<ref name=Yutin2012/> It has been proposed that the ancestor of NCLDVs has evolved from large, virus-like DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krupovic M, Koonin EV | title = Polintons: a hotbed of eukaryotic virus, transposon and plasmid evolution | journal = Nature Reviews.

is a Nicaraguan politician serving as [[President of Nicaragua]] since 2007; previously he was leader of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as Coordinator of the [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] (1979\u20131985) and then as President (1985\u20131990). A leader in the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Sandinista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', ''FSLN''), his policies in government have seen the implementation of leftist reforms across Nicaragua.\n\nBorn into a working-class family, from an early age Ortega opposed ruling President [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], widely recognized as a [[dictator]], and became involved in the underground movement against his regime. Joining the Sandinistas as a student in 1963, Ortega's urban resistance activities led to his arrest in 1967.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite book|title=Ortega Saavedra, Daniel|last=|first=|work=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|publisher=Helicon|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Helicon|location=Abington|pages=}}</ref> After his release in 1974, he also travelled to Cuba to receive training in [[guerilla warfare]] from [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] government.

This led to free elections in which Ortega was defeated by [[Violeta Chamorro]] in the [[Nicaraguan general election, 1990|1990 presidential election]], but he remained an important figure in Nicaraguan opposition politics, gradually moderating in his political position from Marxism\u2013Leninism to [[democratic socialism]]. Also, he restored relations with the [[Catholic Church]], with adoption of [[anti-abortion]] policies.\n\nOrtega was an unsuccessful candidate for president in 1996 and 2001, before winning the [[Nicaraguan general election, 2006|2006 presidential election]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6117704.stm \"Ortega wins Nicaraguan election\"], BBC News, November 8, 2006.</ref> In office, he made alliances with fellow Latin American socialists, such as Venezuelan President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], and under his leadership, Nicaragua joined the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]].\n\nAs of April 19, 2018, [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|IACHR]] of the [[Organization of American States]] stated that Ortega has engaged in a violent oppression campaign against protesters,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr43/8470/2018/en/|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2018-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2018/128.asp|title=Document|website=www.oas.org|access-date=2018-06-14|date=August 2009}}</ref> while government officials and government-owned media have denied such actions.\n\n==Early life==\nOrtega was born in [[La Libertad, Chontales|La Libertad]], department of [[Chontales Department|Chontales]], [[Nicaragua]].

But he did not do so. In 2007 Ortega stated that Nicaragua did not accept the [[One China Policy]] of the PRC government and that Nicaragua reserved the right to maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. He reassured President Chen Shui Bian in 2007 that Nicaragua would not break diplomatic relations with Taiwan. He explained that during the Reagan administration the United States imposed sanctions on Nicaragua. But cutting ties with Taiwan was a sad and painful decision because of the friendship between Nicaragua and Taiwan's people and government. Ortega met with Taiwan's President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2009 and both agreed to improve the diplomatic ties between both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/06/09/211402/Ma-Ying-jeou.htm|title=Ma Ying-jeou shouldn't meet Daniel Ortega|publisher=|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}</ref> However, with a trade show from China in Managua in 2010, he is attempting a two-track policy to get benefits from both sides.

They were originally developed in the late 19th century as a defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, and by the time of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, these \"torpedo boat destroyers\" (TBDs) were \"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats\".<ref>Gove p. 2412</ref> Although the term \"destroyer\" had been used interchangeably with \"TBD\" and \"torpedo boat destroyer\" by navies since 1892, the term \"torpedo boat destroyer\" had been generally shortened to simply \"destroyer\" by nearly all navies by the [[First World War]].<ref>Lyon p. 8, 9</ref>\n\nBefore [[World War II]] destroyers were light vessels with little endurance for unattended ocean operations; typically a number of destroyers and a single [[destroyer tender]] operated together. After the war, the advent of the guided missile allowed destroyers to take on the surface combatant roles previously filled by battleships and cruisers. This resulted in larger and more powerful [[guided missile destroyer]]s more capable of independent operation.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the global standard for [[surface combatant]] ships, with only two nations ([[United States Navy|United States]] and [[Russian Navy|Russia]]) operating the heavier class [[cruiser]]s, with no [[battleship]]s or true [[battlecruiser]]s remaining.<ref>Although the Russian {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|0}} are sometimes classified as battlecruisers, due to their displacement they are described by Russia as large missile cruisers.</ref> Modern guided missile destroyers are equivalent in [[tonnage]] but vastly superior in firepower to cruisers of the World War II era, and are capable of carrying [[nuclear missile|nuclear tipped]] [[cruise missile]]s.

Retrieved August 29, 2014.</ref> guided missile destroyers such as the {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} are actually larger and more heavily armed than most previous ships classified as guided missile cruisers.\n\nSome European navies, such as the French, Spanish, or German, use the term \"[[frigate]]\" for their destroyers, which leads to some confusion.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Whitehead torpedo General Profile, The Whitehead Torpedo U.S.N.1898.jpg|400px|thumb|right|The introduction of the [[Whitehead torpedo]] revolutionized naval warfare.

A navy now had the potential to destroy a superior enemy battle fleet using steam [[launch (boat)|launch]]es to fire torpedoes. Cheap, fast boats armed with torpedoes called [[torpedo boat]]s were built and became a threat to large capital ships near enemy coasts. The first seagoing vessel designed to launch the self-propelled [[Torpedo#Self-propelled torpedoes|Whitehead torpedo]] was the 33-ton {{HMS|Lightning|1876|6}} in 1876. She was armed with two drop collars to launch these weapons, these were replaced in 1879 by a single [[torpedo tube]] in the bow. By the 1880s, the type had evolved into small ships of 50\u2013100 tons, fast enough to evade enemy picket boats.\n\nAt first, the threat of a torpedo boat attack to a battle fleet was considered to exist only when at anchor; but as faster and longer-range torpedoes were developed, the threat extended to cruising at sea. In response to this new threat, more heavily gunned picket boats called \"catchers\" were built which were used to escort the battle fleet at sea. They needed significant seaworthiness and endurance to operate with the battle fleet, and as they necessarily became larger, they became officially designated \"torpedo boat destroyers\", and by the First World War were largely known as \"destroyers\" in English. The anti-torpedo boat origin of this type of ship is retained in its name in other languages, including [[French language|French]] (''contre-torpilleur''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''cacciatorpediniere''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''contratorpedeiro''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''torp\u00e9doborec''), [[Greek language|Greek]] (''antitorpiliko'',''\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc''), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''torpedobootjager'') and, up until the Second World War, [[Polish language|Polish]] (''kontrtorpedowiec'', now obsolete).<ref>Lyon p.  8</ref>\n\nOnce destroyers became more than just catchers guarding an anchorage, it was realized that they were also ideal to take over the role of torpedo boats themselves, so they were fitted with torpedo tubes as well as guns. At that time, and even into [[World War I]], the only function of destroyers was to protect their own battle fleet from enemy torpedo attacks and to make such attacks on the battleships of the enemy. The task of escorting merchant convoys was still in the future.\n\n===Early designs===\n[[File:Kotaka.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''Kotaka'' (1887)]]\nAn important development came with the construction of [[HMS TB 81 (1885)|HMS ''Swift'']] in 1884, later redesignated TB 81.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/torpedo_boats.htm |title=Torpedo Boats |publisher=Battleships-Cruisers.co.uk}}</ref> This was a large (137 ton) torpedo boat with four [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|47&nbsp;mm quick-firing guns]] and three torpedo tubes.

In her trials in 1889, ''Kotaka'' demonstrated that she could exceed the role of coastal defense, and was capable of accompanying larger [[warship]]s on the high seas. The Yarrow shipyards, builder of the parts for ''Kotaka'', \"considered Japan to have effectively invented the destroyer\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Howe |first=Christopher |title=''The Origins of Japanese Trade Supremacy: Development and Technology in Asia from 1540 to the Pacific War'' |year=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-0-226-35485-9}}</ref>\n\n===Torpedo gunboat===\n{{Main|Torpedo gunboat}}\n[[File:HMS Spider.png|thumb|HMS ''Spider'', an early model of torpedo gunboat]]\nThe first vessel designed for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats was the [[torpedo gunboat]]. Essentially very small [[cruiser]]s, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats. By the end of the 1890s torpedo gunboats were made obsolete by their more successful contemporaries, the torpedo boat destroyers, which were much faster.\n\nThe first example of this was {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1886|6}}, designed by [[Nathaniel Barnaby]] in 1885, and commissioned in response to the [[Panjdeh Incident|Russian War scare]].<ref name=\"L&W\">{{cite book |last=Lyon & Winfield |title=The Sail and Steam Navy List|chapter=10|pages=82\u20133}}</ref> The gunboat was armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller [[torpedo boat]]s.

In 1892, the [[Third Sea Lord]], [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John \"Jacky\" Fisher]] ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel [[water-tube boiler]]s and [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] small calibre guns. Six ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder: {{HMS|Daring|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Decoy|1894|6}} from [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]], {{HMS|Havock|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Hornet|1893|6}} from [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrows]], and {{HMS|Ferret|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Lynx|1894|6}} from [[Cammell Laird|Laird, Son & Company]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The British Destroyer|author=Captain T.D. Manning|publisher=Putnam and Co|year=1961}}</ref>\n\nThese torpedo boat destroyers all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) [[forecastle]] that was characteristic of early British TBDs. {{HMS|Daring|1893|6}} and {{HMS|Decoy|1894|6}} were both built by [[Thornycroft]], displaced 260 tons (287.8 tons full load) and were 185 feet in length. They were armed with one [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder gun]] and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount abaft the two funnels. Later the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added instead. They produced 4,200&nbsp;hp from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots, giving the range and speed to travel effectively with a battle fleet. In common with subsequent early Thornycroft boats, they had sloping sterns and double rudders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyon|first=David|title=The First Destroyers|year=1996|isbn=978-1-84067-364-7}}</ref>\n\nThe French navy, an extensive user of torpedo boats, built its first torpedo boat destroyer in 1899, with the {{sclass-|Durandal|destroyer|0}} 'torpilleur d'escadre'. The United States commissioned its first torpedo boat destroyer, {{USS|Bainbridge|DD-1|6}}, Destroyer No. 1, in 1902 and by 1906 there were 16 destroyers in service with the US Navy.<ref>Simpson p. 151</ref>\n\n===Subsequent improvements===\n[[File:Yarrow plan.png|thumb|right|Builders' plans for the British {{sclass-|Charger|destroyer|4}}, built 1894-95.]]\nTorpedo boat destroyer designs continued to evolve around the turn of the 20th century in several key ways. The first was the introduction of the [[steam turbine]]. The spectacular unauthorized demonstration of the turbine powered ''[[Turbinia]]'' at the 1897 Spithead Navy Review, which, significantly, was of torpedo boat size, prompted the Royal Navy to order a prototype turbine powered destroyer, {{HMS|Viper|1899|6}} of 1899. This was the first turbine warship of any kind and achieved a remarkable {{convert|36|kn|km/h|0}} on sea trials. By 1910 the turbine had been widely adopted by all navies for their faster ships.\n\nThe second development was the replacement of the torpedo-boat-style turtleback foredeck by a raised [[forecastle]] for the new {{sclass2-|River|destroyer|2}}s built in 1903, which provided better sea-keeping as well as more space below deck.\n\nThe first warship to use only [[fuel oil]] propulsion was the Royal Navy's torpedo boat destroyer {{HMS|Spiteful|1899|6}}, after experiments in 1904, although the obsolescence of coal as a fuel in British warships was delayed by its availability.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anon. |title=The British Admiralty&nbsp;... |journal=Scientific American |volume=91 |issue=2 |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/stream/scientific-american-1904-07-09/scientific-american-v91-n02-1904-07-09#page/n0/mode/2up |issn=0036-8733}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dahl |first=E.J. |title=Naval innovation: From coal to oil |journal=Joint Force Quarterly |issue=Winter 2000\u201301 |year=2001 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a524799.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022194856/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a524799.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2016 |pages=50\u20136|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> Other navies also adopted oil, for instance the USN with the {{sclass-|Paulding|destroyer|4}} of 1909.\nIn spite of all this variety, destroyers adopted a largely similar pattern. The hull was long and narrow, with a relatively shallow draft. The bow was either raised in a forecastle or covered under a turtleback; underneath this were the crew spaces, extending {{frac|1|4}} to {{frac|1|3}} the way along the hull. Aft of the crew spaces was as much engine space as the technology of the time would allow: several boilers and engines or turbines. Above deck, one or more quick-firing guns were mounted in the bows, in front of the bridge; several more were mounted amidships and astern. Two tube mountings (later on, multiple mountings) were generally found amidships.\n\nBetween 1892 and 1914 destroyers became markedly larger: initially 275&nbsp;tons with a length of {{convert|165|ft|m}} for the Royal Navy's first {{sclass-|Havock|destroyer|4}} of torpedo boat destroyers,<ref>Lyon p. 53</ref> up to the First World War with {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} long destroyers displacing 1000&nbsp;tons was not unusual. However, construction remained focused on putting the biggest possible engines into a small hull, resulting in a somewhat flimsy construction. Often hulls were built of steel only 1/8&nbsp;in thick.\n\nBy 1910 the steam-driven displacement (that is, not [[Planing (sailing)|hydroplaning]]) torpedo boat had become redundant as a separate type. Germany nevertheless continued to build such boats until the end of World War I, although these were effectively small coastal destroyers. In fact Germany never distinguished between the two types, giving them pennant numbers in the same series and never giving names to destroyers. Ultimately the term ''torpedo boat'' came to be attached to a quite different vessel \u2013 the very fast hydroplaning motor driven [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]].\n\n==Early use and World War I==\nNavies originally built torpedo boat destroyers to protect against torpedo boats, but admirals soon appreciated the flexibility of the fast, multi-purpose vessels that resulted. Vice-Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker laid down destroyer duties for the Royal Navy:<ref>Brett, Bernard: \"History of World Sea Power\", Deans International (London) 1985. {{ISBN|0-603-03723-2}}</ref>\n* screening the advance of a fleet when hostile torpedo craft are about\n* searching a hostile coast along which a fleet might pass\n* watching an enemy's port for the purpose of harassing his torpedo craft and preventing their return\n* attacking an enemy fleet\n\nEarly destroyers were extremely cramped places to live, being \"without a doubt magnificent fighting vessels... but unable to stand bad weather\".<ref>Grant p. 136</ref> During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, the commander of the torpedo boat destroyer IJN ''Akatsuki''<ref>Grant, image, frontispiece</ref><ref>Lyon p. 58</ref><ref>Jentschura p. 132 (''Akatsuki'' built by ''Yarrow & Co.'' in 1902; 224' long, displaced 415 tons, two 18\", two 3\" guns, four 57&nbsp;mm Quick Firing Guns, complement 60 officers/men.

Stating that he had originally been strong and healthy, he continued, \"life on a destroyer in winter, with bad food, no comforts, would sap the powers of the strongest men in the long run.

But her commander, LT. John C. Fremont, described her as \"...a compact mass of machinery not meant to keep the sea nor to live in... as five sevenths of the ship are taken up by machinery and fuel, whilst the remaining two sevenths, fore and aft, are the crew's quarters; officers forward and the men placed aft. And even in those spaces are placed anchor engines, steering engines, steam pipes, etc. rendering them unbearably hot in tropical regions.\"<ref>Simpson p. 100</ref>\n\n===Early combat===\n[[File:HMS Loyal (1913) IWM SP 001136.jpg|300px|thumb|{{HMS|Loyal|1913|6}}, of the {{sclass-|Laforey|destroyer (1913)|4}}]]\nThe torpedo boat destroyer's first major use in combat came during the [[Battle of Port Arthur|Japanese surprise attack on the Russian fleet]] anchored in [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] at the opening of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] on 8 February 1904.\n\nThree destroyer divisions attacked the Russian fleet in port, firing a total of 18 torpedoes. However, only two Russian battleships, {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}}, as well as the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pallada|1899|2}}, were seriously damaged due to the proper deployment of [[torpedo net]]s. ''Tsesarevich'', the Russian flagship, had her nets deployed, with at least four enemy torpedoes \"hung up\" in them,<ref>Grant p. 42</ref> and other warships were similarly saved from further damage by their nets.<ref>Grant p. 33, 34, 40</ref>\n\nWhile capital ship engagements were scarce in World War I, destroyer units engaged almost continually in raiding and patrol actions. The first shot of the war at sea was fired on 5 August 1914 by a destroyer of the 2nd Flotilla, {{HMS|Lance|1914|6}}, in an engagement with the German auxiliary [[minelayer]] {{SS|K\u00f6nigin Luise|1913|2}}.\n\nDestroyers were involved in the skirmishes that prompted the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], and filled a range of roles in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], acting as troop transports and as fire-support vessels, as well as their fleet-screening role. Over 80 British destroyers and 60 German torpedo-boats took part in the [[Battle of Jutland]], which involved pitched small-boat actions between the main fleets, and several foolhardy attacks by unsupported destroyers on capital ships. Jutland also concluded with a messy night action between the German [[High Seas Fleet]] and part of the British destroyer screen.\n\n[[File:Wickes dd75.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Wickes|DD-75|6}}, a {{sclass-|Wickes|destroyer|2}}]]\nThe threat evolved by [[World War I]] with the development of the [[submarine]], or [[U-boat]]. The submarine had the potential to hide from gunfire and close underwater to fire torpedoes. Early-war destroyers had the speed and armament to intercept submarines before they submerged, either by gunfire or by ramming. Destroyers also had a shallow enough draft that torpedoes would find it difficult to hit them.\n\n[[File:HMS Badger (1911).jpg|300px|thumb|{{HMS|Badger|1911|6}} was the first destroyer to successfully ram a submarine]]\nThe desire to attack submarines underwater led to rapid destroyer evolution during the war. They were quickly equipped with strengthened bows for ramming, and [[depth charge]]s and [[hydrophone]]s for identifying submarine targets. The first submarine casualty to a destroyer was the German {{SMU|U-19|Germany|2}}, rammed by {{HMS|Badger|1911|6}} on 29 October 1914. While ''U-19'' was only damaged, the next month {{HMS|Garry}} successfully sank {{SMU|U-18|Germany|2}}. The first depth-charge sinking was on 4 December 1916, when {{SMU|UC-19|3=2}}<ref>''U-Boats Destroyed'', Paul Kemp (1997), {{ISBN|1-85409-515-3}}</ref> was sunk by HMS ''Llewellyn''.\n\nThe submarine threat meant that many destroyers spent their time on anti-submarine patrol. Once Germany adopted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in January 1917, destroyers were called on to escort merchant [[convoy]]s. US Navy destroyers were among the first American units to be dispatched upon the American entry to the war, and a squadron of Japanese destroyers even joined Allied patrols in the Mediterranean. Patrol duty was far from safe; of the 67 British destroyers lost in the war, collisions accounted for 18, while 12 were wrecked.\n\nAt the end of the war, the state-of-the-art was represented by the British [[V and W-class destroyer|W class]].\n\n==1918\u20131945==\n{{See also|List of destroyers of the Second World War}}\n[[File:Scout cruiser Nibbio (M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti).jpg|thumb|The Italian scout cruiser ''Nibbio'' in 1919 (ordered by Romania in 1913 as a destroyer), one year before being sold to Romania as ''M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti'' and re-rated as destroyer]]\n[[File:Velox.jpg|right|thumb|V-class destroyer, {{HMS|Velox|D34|6}}]]\n\nThe trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments. A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the War, because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo. The British [[V and W-class destroyer|V and W classes]] of the late war had sought to address this by mounting six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, instead of the four or two on earlier models. The 'V' and 'W's set the standard of destroyer building well into the 1920s.\n\nThe two Romanian destroyers {{ship|NMS|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti||2}} and {{ship|NMS|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti||2}}, on the other hand, had the greatest firepower of all destroyers in the world throughout the first half of the 1920s. This was largely due to the fact that, between their commissioning in 1920 and 1926, they retained the armament that they had while serving in the Italian Navy as [[scout cruiser]]s (''[[esploratori]]''). When initially ordered by Romania in 1913, the Romanian specifications envisioned three 120&nbsp;mm guns, a caliber which would eventually be adopted as the standard for future Italian destroyers. Armed with three 152&nbsp;mm and four 76&nbsp;mm guns after being completed as scout cruisers, the two warships were officially re-rated as destroyers by the [[Romanian Navy]]. The two Romanian warships were thus the destroyers with the greatest firepower in the world throughout much of the interwar period. As of 1939, when the Second World War started, their artillery, although changed, was still close to cruiser standards, amounting to nine heavy naval guns (five of 120 mm and four of 76 mm). In addition, they retained their two twin 457 mm torpedo tubes as well as two machine guns, plus the capacity to carry up to 50 mines.<ref>''Brassey's Annual: The Armed Forces Year-book'', Praeger Publishers, 1939, p. 276</ref>\n\n[[File:Uranami II.jpg|left|thumb|''Fubuki''-class destroyer, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Uranami|1928|2}}]]The next major innovation came with the Japanese {{sclass-|Fubuki|destroyer|4}} or 'special type', designed in 1923 and delivered in 1928. The design was initially noted for its powerful armament of six five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns and three triple torpedo mounts. The second batch of the class gave the guns high-angle turrets for anti-aircraft warfare, and the {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} oxygen-fueled 'Long Lance' [[Type 93 torpedo]]. The later {{sclass-|Hatsuharu|destroyer|4}} of 1931 further improved the torpedo armament by storing its reload torpedoes close at hand in the superstructure, allowing reloading within 15 minutes.\n\nMost other nations replied with similar larger ships. The US {{sclass-|Porter|destroyer|4}} adopted twin five-inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns, and the subsequent {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|4}} and {{sclass-|Gridley|destroyer|4}}es (the latter of 1934) increased the number of torpedo tubes to 12 and 16 respectively.\n\n[[File:Fantasque.jpg|thumb|France's {{sclass-|Fantasque|destroyer|4}}, the fastest destroyer class ever built.]]\nIn the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy's building of very fast light cruisers of the {{sclass-|Condottieri|cruiser|4}} prompted the French to produce exceptional destroyer designs. The French had long been keen on large destroyers, with their {{sclass-|Chacal|destroyer|4}} of 1922 displacing over 2,000&nbsp;tons and carrying 130&nbsp;mm guns; a further three similar classes were produced around 1930. The {{sclass-|Fantasque|destroyer|4}} of 1935 carried five {{convert|138|mm|in}} guns and nine torpedo tubes, but could achieve speeds of {{convert|45|kn|kph|0}}, which remains the record speed for a steamship and for any destroyer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The Italians' own destroyers were almost as swift, most Italian designs of the 1930s being rated at over {{convert|38|knot|km/h|0}}, while carrying torpedoes and either four or six 120&nbsp;mm guns.\n\nGermany started to build destroyers again during the 1930s as part of Hitler's rearmament program. The Germans were also fond of large destroyers, but while the initial [[German World War II destroyers|Type 1934]] displaced over 3,000&nbsp;tons, their armament was equal to smaller vessels. This changed from the Type 1936 onwards, which mounted heavy {{convert|150|mm|in}} guns. German destroyers also used innovative high-pressure steam machinery: while this should have helped their efficiency, it more often resulted in mechanical problems.\n\nOnce German and Japanese rearmament became clear, the British and American navies consciously focused on building destroyers that were smaller but more numerous than those used by other nations. The British built a series of destroyers (the {{sclass2-|A|destroyer|4||1929}} to {{sclass2-|I|destroyer|4}}) which were about 1,400&nbsp;tons standard displacement, had four {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and eight torpedo tubes; the American {{sclass-|Benson|destroyer|4}} of 1938 similar in size, but carried five {{convert|5|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns and ten torpedo tubes. Realizing the need for heavier gun armament, the British built the {{sclass2-|Tribal|destroyer (1936)|4}} of 1936 (sometimes called ''Afridi'' after one of two lead ships). These ships displaced 1,850&nbsp;tons and were armed with eight {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in four twin turrets and four torpedo tubes. These were followed by the [[J-, K- and N-class destroyer|J-class]] and L-class destroyers, with six {{convert|4.7|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in twin turrets and eight torpedo tubes.\n\nAnti-submarine sensors included [[sonar]] (or ASDIC), although training in their use was indifferent. Anti-submarine weapons changed little, and ahead-throwing weapons, a need recognized in World War I, had made no progress.\n\n===Later combat===\n[[File:USS McGowan (DD-678) at sea, circa in 1945.jpg|thumb|{{USS|McGowan|DD-678|6}}, a {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|2}} during World War II]]\n{{further|American World War II destroyers|British World War II destroyers|French World War II destroyers|German World War II destroyers|Italian World War II destroyers|Japanese World War II destroyers|Soviet World War II destroyers|Romanian World War II destroyers}}\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s destroyers were often deployed to areas of diplomatic tension or humanitarian disaster. British and American destroyers were common on the Chinese coast and rivers, even supplying landing parties to protect colonial interests.\n\nBy [[World War II]] the threat had evolved once again. Submarines were more effective, and [[aircraft]] had become important weapons of naval warfare; once again the early-war fleet destroyers were ill-equipped for combating these new targets. They were fitted with new light [[anti-aircraft]] guns, [[radar]], and [[Hedgehog (weapon)|forward-launched ASW]] weapons, in addition to their existing [[dual-purpose gun]]s, [[depth charge]]s, and torpedoes. In most cases torpedo and/or dual-purpose gun armament was reduced to accommodate new [[anti-air warfare|anti-air]] and [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] weapons. By this time the destroyers had become large, multi-purpose vessels, expensive targets in their own right. As a result, casualties on destroyers were among the highest.\n\nThe need for large numbers of anti-submarine ships led to the introduction of smaller and cheaper specialized anti-submarine warships called [[corvette]]s and [[frigate]]s by the Royal Navy and [[destroyer escort]]s by the USN. A similar programme was belatedly started by the Japanese (see {{sclass-|Matsu|destroyer|2}}). These ships had the size and displacement of the original torpedo boat destroyers that the contemporary destroyer had evolved from.\n\n==Post-World War II==\n[[File:Blyskawica l d.jpg|thumb|[[Polish Navy|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|B\u0142yskawica}}, currently preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Gdynia]].]]\nSome conventional destroyers were completed in the late 1940s and 1950s which built on wartime experience. These vessels were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit Machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons such as the [[Squid (weapon)|Squid mortar]]. Examples include the British {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer (1949)|0}}, US {{sclass-|Forrest Sherman|destroyer|0}}, and the Soviet {{sclass-|Kotlin|destroyer|2}}s.\n\nSome World War II\u2013vintage ships were modernized for anti-submarine warfare, and to extend their service lives, to avoid having to build (expensive) brand-new ships. Examples include the US [[FRAM I]] programme and the British [[Type 15 frigate]]s converted from fleet destroyers.\n\nThe advent of [[surface-to-air missile]]s and [[surface-to-surface missile]]s, such as the [[Exocet]], in the early 1960s changed naval warfare. [[Guided missile destroyer]]s (DDG in the US Navy) were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine and surface threats. Examples include the Soviet {{sclass-|Kashin|destroyer|4}}, the British {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|4}}, and the US {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|4}}.\n\n21st century destroyers tend to display features such as large, slab sides without complicated corners and crevices to keep the [[radar cross-section]] small, [[vertical launch system]]s to carry a large number of missiles at high readiness to fire and [[helicopter]] flight decks and [[hangars]].\n\n==Operators==\n*{{navy|Argentina}} Operates four {{sclass-|Almirante Brown|destroyer|2}}s and a single modified [[Type 42 destroyer]].\n*{{navy|Australia}} Operates two {{sclass-|Hobart|destroyer|2}}<nowiki/>s with one more to be commissioned.

As the expense of heavier surface combatants has generally removed them from the fleet, destroyer tonnage has grown (a modern ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer has the same tonnage as a [[World War II]] [[light cruiser]]). Many modern destroyer designs delegate their anti-submarine role to embarked helicopters, which in addition to anti-submarine warfare can also be used for maritime rescue and vertical replenishment.\n\n:In October 2013 the first of three U.S. {{sclass-|Zumwalt|destroyer|0}} destroyers left dry dock, the destroyer built with specific structural angles and a superstructure wrapped in a carbon fiber composite canopy to reduce its risk of radar detection by a factor of 50.<ref name=CNN20131029 /> The ship, with 80 missiles and a crew of 150, will include two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) that can fire rocket-powered, computer-guided shells to destroy targets {{convert|63|mi|km}} away.<ref name=CNN20131029>{{cite web |url=http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/29/bigger-faster-deadlier-navy-launches-new-stealth-destroyer/ |title=Bigger, Lighter, Deadlier!

Her successes there, including two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in [[left-wing politics]] resulted in the being placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]].\n\nDismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a \"wisecracker.\" Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAlso known as Dot or Dottie, Parker was born Dorothy Rothschild in 1893 to Jacob Henry<ref>{{cite book | last =Meade | first =Marion | title =Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This? | publisher =Penguin Books | year =1987 | location =New York | page =5 | isbn =0-14-011616-8}}</ref> and Eliza Annie Rothschild (n\u00e9e Marston)<ref>Meade 6</ref> at 732 Ocean Avenue in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news |url=http://dorothyparker.com/nytobit.html |title=Dorothy Parker, 73, Literary Wit, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 1967|first=Alden |last=Whitman }}</ref> Her parents had a summer beach cottage there.

He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City.

An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager; however, it was the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" that caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. In 1938 they moved to the Welsh fishing village of   [[Laugharne]] where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\n\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as a populist voice of the literary scene.\n\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\n\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''n\u00e9e'' Williams; 1882\u20131958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher.

His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite.

Thomas had extended stays here in the 1920s with his aunt Annie and her husband, Jim Jones, and wrote about the house in his short story, ''The Peaches''.

He was a leading figure in the music industry and is often considered to be one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and fellow musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on [[popular music]]. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]]. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, releasing [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|eleven number-one albums]]. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996.\n\nBorn in [[Brixton]], [[South London]], Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music, and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"[[Space Oddity]]\" became his first top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]''. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that would come to be known as the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\". ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and \"[[Under Pressure]]\", a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He then reached his commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'', with its [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] topping both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[oldschool jungle|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), [[Jareth]] the Goblin King in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped concert touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with the release of ''[[The Next Day]].'' He remained musically active until he [[Death of David Bowie|died of liver cancer]] two days after the release of his final album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016).\n\n==Early life==\nBowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in [[Brixton]], London.

The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]] in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child\u2014and a defiant brawler.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 9\u201316</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Bowie moved with his family to [[Bromley]]. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \"adequate\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].<ref name=\"sandford18-19\">Sandford (1997): pp. 18\u201319</ref> At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \"vividly artistic\" and his poise \"astonishing\" for a child.<ref name=\"sandford18-19\"/> The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Little Richard]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 21.</ref><ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> Upon listening to Little Richard's song \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\", Bowie would later say that he had \"heard God\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8\u20139|date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nBowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\">Sandford (1997): pp. 19\u201320</ref> By the end of the following year, he had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]\u2014complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists\u2014to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as \"mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]].<ref name=\"bromleytech\"/>\n\nIt was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:\n\n{{quote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of Owen Frampton. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.<ref name=\"bromleytech\">Sandford (1997): pp. 21\u201322</ref>}}\n\nBowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting.

Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 28</ref> When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to \"do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]\u2014and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\">Sandford (1997): pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nConn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Mannish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul\u2014\"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]\", Bowie was to recall.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\" /> Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s \"[[I Pity the Fool]]\" was no more successful than \"Liza Jane\", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[The Who]]. \"[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]\" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the [[The Riot Squad|Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[The Velvet Underground]], went unreleased.

Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.\" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust\u2014and, later, the Thin White Duke\u2014from his own character offstage.

To promote it, Bowie launched the [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by [[Toni Basil]], and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by [[Alan Yentob]]. The resulting documentary, ''[[Cracked Actor]]'', featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy [[cocaine]] use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, [[paranoia]], and emotional problems.<ref name=\"buckley 204-5\">Buckley (2005): pp. 204\u20135</ref> He later commented that the accompanying live album, ''[[David Live]]'', ought to have been titled \"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\". ''David Live'' nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of [[Eddie Floyd]]'s \"[[Knock on Wood (song)|Knock on Wood]]\".

He attended the [[Actors Studio]], made his first television appearance in 1954, and soon after appeared alongside [[James Dean]] in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956) and ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the OK Corral]]'' (1957). In the next ten years he made a name in television, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films. Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Dennis Hopper\">{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7786470/Dennis-Hopper.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Dennis Hopper | date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHopper made his directorial film debut with ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), which he and co-star [[Peter Fonda]] wrote with [[Terry Southern]]. The film earned Hopper a [[Cannes Film Festival]] Award for \"Best First Work\" and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] (shared with Fonda and Southern). Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: \"With its portrait of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, ''Easy Rider'' became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion\".<ref>Hornaday, Ann (May 29, 2010).

He went on to helm his third directorial work ''[[Out of the Blue (1980 film)|Out of the Blue]]'' (1980), for which he was again honored at Cannes, and appeared in ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983). He saw a career resurgence in 1986 when he was widely acclaimed for his performances in ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'', the latter of which saw him nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. His fourth directorial outing came about through ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' (1988), followed by an [[Emmy]]-nominated lead performance in ''[[Paris Trout]]'' (1991).

With the release of ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer.

Hopper became a stereotype for some male youths who rejected traditional jobs and traditional American culture, partly exemplified by Fonda's long sideburns and Hopper wearing shoulder-length hair and a long mustache. They were denied rooms in motels and proper service in restaurants as a result of their radical looks.<ref name=Hillman>Hillman, Betty Luther.

In 1970 he filmed ''The Last Movie'', cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like ''Easy Rider'', and did not like the film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding \u2013 as convoluted as an abstract painting.

In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from ''Easy Rider'', he married singer [[Michelle Phillips]] of [[The Mamas and the Papas]]  on [[Halloween]] of 1970.  The marriage lasted eight days.\n\nHopper was able to sustain his lifestyle and a measure of celebrity by acting in numerous [[low budget]] and European films throughout the 1970s as the archetypal \"tormented maniac\", including ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]'' (1976), ''[[Tracks (1976 film)|Tracks]]'' (1976), and ''[[The American Friend]]'' (1977). With [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s blockbuster ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), Hopper returned to prominence as a hyper-manic Vietnam-era photojournalist. Stepping in for an overwhelmed director, Hopper won praise in 1980 for his directing and acting in ''[[Out of the Blue (1980 film)|Out of the Blue]]''. Immediately thereafter, Hopper starred as an addled short-order cook \"Cracker\" in the [[Neil Young]]/[[Dean Stockwell]] low-budget collaboration ''[[Human Highway]]''.

The [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] adopted the term \"demiurge\". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\n\nThe word \"demiurge\" is an English word derived from ''demiurgus'', a [[List of Latinised names|Latinized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2}} or ''d\u0113miourgos''. It was originally a common noun meaning \"craftsman\" or \"artisan\", but gradually came to mean \"producer\", and eventually \"creator\". The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Plato's ''Timaeus'']], written {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;310\u201390 BC) and Middle Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;90 BC \u2013 AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the [[Theory of Forms|<!-- capitalized-->Ideas]], but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself \"[[Form of the Good|the One]]\". In the arch-[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is [[Evil|malevolent]], as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\n\n==Platonism and neoplatonism==\n[[Plato]], as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (28a [[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]), {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who \"fashioned and shaped\" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly [[:wikt:benevolence|benevolent]], and so it desires a world as good as possible. The world remains imperfect, however, because the Demiurge created the world out of a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaotic]], [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminate]] non-being.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Plato's work ''Timaeus'' is a philosophical reconciliation of [[Hesiod]]'s cosmology in his ''[[Theogony]]'', [[syncretism|syncretically]] reconciling Hesiod to [[Homer]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origin|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Fontenrose|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56ansk4SyQC&pg=PA226 | isbn=978-0-8196-0285-5 | publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chorology: On Beginning in Plato's Timaeus|year=1999|first=John|last=Sallis|page=86|isbn=0-253-21308-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gS_9aQ5mYKgC&pg=PA86 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The mythology of ancient Greece and Italy|first=Thomas|last=Keightley|year=1838|page=44|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWAEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=theogony+timaeus}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Platonism===\nIn [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]]'s [[Neo-Pythagorean]] and Middle Platonist [[cosmogony]], the Demiurge is second God as the ''[[nous]]'' or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Hacket Publishing|year=|isbn=978-0-872205758|location=Indianapolis|pages=124}}</ref>\n\n===Neoplatonism===\n[[Plotinus]] and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge.

The second principle is organization in its reflection of the [[Sentience|nonsentient]] force or ''[[Potentiality and actuality|dynamis]]'', also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is ''energeia'' emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called ''nous'', Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. [[Plotinus]] also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in ''[[The Enneads]]''<ref>\"Matter is therefore a non-existent\"; Plotinus, ''Ennead'' 2, Tractate 4 Section 16.</ref> which more correctly is to express the concept of [[idealism]] or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or ''nous'' (c.f. [[pantheism]]).\n\nPlotinus' form of [[Platonic idealism]] is to treat the Demiurge, ''nous'' as the contemplative faculty (''ergon'') within man which orders the force (''dynamis'') into conscious reality.<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this Neoplatonist philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught (Enneads, iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time, with the explanation: 'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind' (''neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima''), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (''oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere'').\" (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy\", \u00a7&nbsp;7) Similarly, Professor Ludwig Noir\u00e9 wrote: \"For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (Enneads, iii, 7, 10), where he says, 'The only space or place of the world is the soul', and 'Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul'.\" [5] It is worth noting, however, that like Plato but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas in order to know external objects.</ref> In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as ''nous'' (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also [[Philo]]).<ref>[[Numenius of Apamea]] was reported to have asked, \"What else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?\" Fr. 8 Des Places.</ref>\n\nThe Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the ''Nous'' (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:\n* ''[[Arche]]'' (Gr. \"beginning\") \u2013 the source of all things,\n* ''[[Logos]]'' (Gr. \"reason/cause\") \u2013 the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,\n* ''[[:wikt:harmonia|Harmonia]]'' (Gr. \"harmony\") \u2013 numerical [[ratios]] in [[mathematics]].\n\nBefore Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'', no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the [[allegory]] in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]] who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n====Iamblichus====\n{{See also|Panentheism}}\nLater, the Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] changed the role of the \"One\", effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] came into conflict.\n\nThe figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable \u201cOne,\u201d or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of ''[[henosis]]''.<ref>See [http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html Theurgy, Iamblichus and henosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100359/http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html |date=2010-01-09 }}.</ref>\nIamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (''nous''), while among \"the many\" that follow it there is a second, super-existent \"One\" that is the producer of intellect or soul (''psyche'').\n\nThe \"One\" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a [[wikt:triad#Noun|triad]] is formed of the [[perception|intelligible]] ''nous'', the [[noesis|intellective]] ''nous'', and the ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Actus et potentia|''actus'' and ''potentia'']] (actuality and potentiality) of the [[unmoved mover]] and Plato's Demiurge.\n\nThen within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine ''nous'' with the intellectual triad being promoted to a ''hebdomad'' (pure intellect).\n\nIn the theoretic of Plotinus, ''nous'' produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.\n\n==Gnosticism==\n[[Gnosticism]] presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God and the demiurgic \"creator\" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Supreme Being]]: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine ''in'' materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[problem of evil]].\n\n===Mythos===\nOne Gnostic [[mythos]] describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Greek: \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, lit. \"wisdom\"), the Demiurge's mother a partial aspect of the divine ''[[Pleroma]]'' or \"Fullness,\" desired to create something apart from the [[Absolute (philosophy)|divine totality]], without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.\n\nThe Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior [[Pleroma|Pleromatic]] realm: He frames the [[seven heavens]], as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working however blindly, and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word ''d\u0113miourgos'' properly describes his relation to the material; he is the ''father'' of that which is animal like himself.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 1.]</ref>\n\nThus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe: the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities which were its primal source.\n\n===Angels===\n[[Psalm 82]] begins ({{bibleref2|Psa|82:1|NET|verse 1}}), \"God stands in the assembly of [[El (deity)|El]] (the [[Septuagint]] here says the assembly of gods), in the midst of the gods he renders judgment\", indicating a plurality of gods, although it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. [[Philo]] had inferred from the expression \"Let us make man\" of the [[Book of Genesis]] that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to His helpers in the work of creation.<ref>{{quote|It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, 'Let us make man,' which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants, in order that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man, when he does right attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.|{{cite web |title=Philo: On the Creation, XXIV |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book1.html |website=www.earlyjewishwritings.com}}}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis.<ref>[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. c. 67.</ref> So [[Irenaeus]] tells<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 1.</ref> of the system of [[Simon Magus]],<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 5.</ref> of the system of [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]],<ref>Irenaeus, i. 24, 1.</ref> of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 25.</ref> of the system of [[Carpocrates]].

The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.\n\nThe Latin translation, confirmed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]],<ref>Hippolytus, ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''. vii. 33.</ref> makes [[Irenaeus]] state that according to [[Cerinthus]] (who shows [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of Him. [[Theodoret]],<ref>Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. ii. 3.</ref> who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number \"powers,\" and so [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]<ref>Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 28.</ref> represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that the world was made by angels.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]\n\nIn the [[Ophites|Ophite]] and [[Sethians|Sethian]] systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, \"Yaldabaoth\" (also known as \"Yaltabaoth\" or \"Ialdabaoth\").\n\nIn the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' {{circa}}&nbsp;AD 120\u2013180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:\n<blockquote>\nNow the [[archon]] [\"ruler\"] who is weak has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas [\"fool\"], and the third is [[Samael]]. And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said, 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.<ref>\"Apocryphon of John,\" translation by Frederik Wisse in ''The Nag Hammadi Library''. Accessed online at [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html gnosis.org]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the [[Pleroma]]. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Demiurge|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\nYaldabaoth is frequently called \"the Lion-faced\", ''leontoeides'', and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 32, p.&nbsp;191.</ref> described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: \"the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire\". Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 9.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments (pp.&nbsp;257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.\n\nUnder the name of ''Nebro'' (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''. He is first mentioned in \"The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld\" as one of the twelve angels to come \"into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld]\". He comes from heaven, and it is said his \"face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood\". Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel [[Saklas]] to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels \"with each one receiving a portion in the heavens\".\n\n====Names====\n[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|right|Drawing of the ''leontocephaline'' found at the [[Mithraeum]] of C. Valerius Heracles and sons, dedicated 190 AD at [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (CIMRM 312).]]\n\nThe most probable derivation of the name \"Yaldabaoth\" was that given by [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. Giesler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic ''yald\u0101 bahuth'', {{lang|arc|\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d0\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea}}, meaning \"Son of Chaos\". However, [[Gilles Quispel]] notes:\n{{quote|[[Gershom Scholem]], the third genius in this field, more specifically the genius of precision, has taught us that some of us were wrong when they believed that Jaldabaoth means \"son of chaos\", because the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''bahutha'' in the sense of chaos only existed in the imagination of the author of a well-known dictionary. This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''. ... [[Phanes]] is represented with the mask of a ''lion's'' head on his breast, while from his sides the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the [[Mithraism|Mithras mysteries]], to indicate [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of [[Mithraism#Lion-headed figure|the monstrous figure with the head of a lion]], which symbolises Time, [[Chronos]], in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Quispel|first=Gilles|authorlink=Gilles Quispel|page=64|title=Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel|editor1-first= Johannes|editor1-last=Van Oort|isbn=978-90-04-13945-9|year=2008|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV|location=Leiden}}</ref>}}\n\n\"[[Samael]]\" literally means \"Blind God\" or \"God of the Blind\" in Hebrew ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d0\u05dc}}). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in [[Judaism]] as the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] and in Christian [[demon]]ology. This link to Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with [[Satan]]. Another alternative title for the demiurge is \"Saklas\", Aramaic for \"fool\".\n\n\n\nThe angelic name \"[[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]\" (meaning \"the lion of God\" in Hebrew)<ref>{{cite book|title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition|first=Gershom|last=Scholem|publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America|year=1965|page=72}}</ref> has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his \"perfect\" name;<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert McLachlan Wilson|title=Nag Hammadi and gnosis: Papers read at the First International Congress of Coptology|year=1976|publisher=BRILL|pages=21\u201323|quote=''Therefore his esoteric name is Jaldabaoth, whereas the perfect call him Ariel, because he has the appearance of a lion.''}}</ref> in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gustav Davidson|title=A dictionary of angels: including the fallen angels |year=1994 |publisher=Scrollhouse |page=54}}</ref> The name has also been inscribed on amulets as \"Ariel Ialdabaoth\",<ref>{{cite book|author=David M Gwynn|title=Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL |page=448}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Campbell Bonner |title=An Amulet of the Ophite Gnostics |year=1949 |publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 8|pages=43\u201346}}</ref> and the figure of the archon inscribed with \"Aariel\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gilles Quispel |author2=R. van den Broek |author-link2=Roel van den Broek |author3=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren |title=Studies in gnosticism and hellenistic religions|year=1981|publisher=BRILL|pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Marcion===\nAccording to [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was ''d\u00edkaios,'' severely just, the latter ''agath\u00f3s,'' or loving-kind; the former was the \"god of this world\" ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}), the God of the [[Old Testament]], the latter the true God of the [[New Testament]]. Christ, though in reality the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the Messiah of the Demiurge, the better to spread the truth concerning His heavenly Father. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom, the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Valentinus===\nIt is in the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]] that the name ''D\u0113miourgos'' is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the [[Abraxas|great Archon]] of Basilides, the Elohim of Justinus, etc.\n\nThe Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (''he k\u00e1t\u014d soph\u00eda'' or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (''pneumatiko\u00ed''), the animal (''psychiko\u00ed'') and the material (''hyliko\u00ed''). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with matter.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5.]</ref> And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of ''Soph\u00eda'' the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propat\u00f4r, or Supreme God.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn creating this world out of Chaos the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either ''hyliko\u00ed'' or ''pneumatiko\u00ed''.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor ''hyle''; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (''hyle'') and soul (''psych\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Catholic\"/><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103106.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 6.]</ref> In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===The devil===\nOpinions on [[the devil]], and his relationship to the Demiurge, varied. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103130.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 30, 8.]</ref> According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of ''spiritual'' beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a ''spirit'' of wickedness, is able to recognise the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 4.]</ref>\n\nThe Valentinian [[Heracleon]]<ref>[http://www.gnosis.org/library/fragh.htm Heracleon, Frag. 20.]</ref> interpreted the devil as the ''principle'' of evil, that of ''hyle'' (matter). As he writes in his commentary on {{bibleverse||John|4:21}},\n<blockquote>The mountain represents the Devil, or his world, since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation or the Creator whom the Jews worship. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. </blockquote>\n\nThis vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, [[Irenaeus]] stated that \"Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103325.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', iii. 25.]</ref>\n\n===Cathars===\n[[Catharism]] apparently inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Quispel writes,\n\n{{quote|There is a direct link between ancient Gnosticism and Catharism. The Cathars held that the creator of the world, Satanael, had usurped the name of God, but that he had subsequently been unmasked and told that he was not really God.<ref>Quispel, Gilles and Van Oort, Johannes (2008), p. 143.</ref>}}\n\n==Neoplatonism and Gnosticism==\n{{Wikisource|1=Enneads/Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil|2=Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those that Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil}}\n{{Main|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\nGnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator, though in some Gnostic traditions the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser\u2014rather than evil\u2014perspective, such as that of [[Valentinius]].\n\n===Plotinus===\nThe Neoplatonic philosopher [[Plotinus]] addressed within his works Gnosticism's conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus is noted as the founder of [[Neoplatonism]] (along with his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]]).<ref>John D. Turner. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm Neoplatonism].</ref> In the ninth [[tractate]] of the second of his ''Enneads'', Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:\n\n{{quote|From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality they assert in the Intellectual Realm\u2014the Authentic Existent, the Intellectual-Principle, ''the Second Creator and the Soul''\u2014all this is taken over from the Timaeus.|Ennead 2.9.vi; emphasis added from [[A.H. Armstrong]]'s introduction to Ennead 2.9}}\n\nOf note here is the remark concerning the second [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] or Creator and third hypostasis or [[Anima mundi|World Soul]]. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for \"all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own\" which, he declares, \"have been picked up outside of the truth\";<ref name=\"sacred-texts\">\"For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own have been picked up outside of the truth.\" Plotinus \"Against the Gnostics\", [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn161.htm ''Ennead'' II, 9, 6.]</ref> they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato\u2019s original intentions.\n\nWhereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: \"Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil\" (generally quoted as \"Against the Gnostics\"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the ''nous'' or mind's [[noumenon]] (see [[Heraclitus]]) and the material world ([[phenomenon]]) by believing the material world is evil.\n\nThe majority of scholars tend<ref>{{cite book|title=Plotinus: Enneads II|edition=Loeb Classical Library|author=Plotinus, Arthur Hilary Armstrong (trans.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1966|quote=From this point to the end of ch. 12 Plotinus is attacking a Gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of Valentinus. The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferier and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.' Gnostic sects borrowed freely from each other, and it is likely that Valentinius took some of his ideas about Sophia from older Gnostic sources, and that his ideas in turn influenced other Gnostics.}}</ref> to understand Plotinus' opponents as being a Gnostic sect\u2014certainly (specifically [[Sethianism|Sethian]]), several such groups were present in [[Alexandria]] and elsewhere about the [[Mediterranean]] during Plotinus' lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.\n\nThough the former understanding certainly enjoys the greatest popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended<ref>Evangeliou, \"Plotinus's Anti-Gnostic Polemic and Porphyry's Against the Christians\", in Wallis & Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Plotinus%27s+Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+and+Porphyry%27s+Against+the+Christians%22+Christos+Evangeliou&source=bl&ots=rSBVKFe8VD&sig=3MNVVSq8bDZs4koa-yMP6PaNT-Q&hl=en&ei=jR4hTIK_AsP48AbV_shl&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Plotinus%27s%20Anti-Gnostic%20Polemic%20and%20Porphyry%27s%20Against%20the%20Christians%22%20Christos%20Evangeliou&f=false p. 111.]</ref> that Plotinus\u2019 opponents might be better described as simply \"Christian Gnostics\", arguing that several of Plotinus\u2019 criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term \"Gnostics\" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] names [[Christianity]] specifically in Porphyry's own works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian [[Origen]], none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity\u2014whereas Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the ''Enneads'' as the Gnostics.\n\n[[A.H. Armstrong]] identified the so-called \"Gnostics\" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the ''Enneads''. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.<ref>From \"Introduction to Against the Gnostics\", Plotinus' ''Enneads'' as translated by A.H. Armstrong, pp. 220\u201322: \"The treatise as it stands in the Enneads is a most powerful protest on behalf of Hellenic philosophy against the un-Hellenic heresy (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.\"</ref><ref>Armstrong, pp. 220\u201322: \"Short statement of the doctrine of the three hypostasis, the One, Intellect and Soul; there cannot be more or fewer than these three.

Turner]], professor of religious studies at the University of Nebraska, and famed translator and editor of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], stated<ref>Turner, \"Gnosticism and Platonism\", in Wallis & Bregman.</ref> that the text Plotinus and his students read was Sethian Gnosticism, which predates Christianity. It appears that Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[dystheism]] or [[misotheism]] for the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.\n\n[[Emil Cioran]] also wrote his ''Le mauvais d\u00e9miurge'' (\"The Evil Demiurge\"), published in 1969, influenced by Gnosticism and [[Schopenhauer]]ian interpretation of Platonic ontology, as well as that of Plotinus.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n*[[Albinus (philosopher)]]\n*[[Devil in Christianity]]\n*[[Emil Cioran]]\n*[[Gnosticism]]\n*[[Mara (demon)]]\n*[[Mayasura]]\n*[[Narasimha]]\n*[[Problem of the creator of God]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* ''This article incorporates text from the entry '''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf8ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA804 Demiurgus]''' in ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines'' by [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] and [[Henry Wace (Anglican priest)|Henry Wace]] (1877), a publication now in the public domain.''\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071016173047/http://timelessmyths.com/mirrors/gnostic.php Dark Mirrors of Heaven: Gnostic Cosmogony]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Demiurge}}\n\n{{Ancient Greek philosophical concepts}}\n{{Theology}}\n{{Plato navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Conceptions of God]]\n[[Category:Concepts in ancient Greek metaphysics]]\n[[Category:Creator deities]]\n[[Category:Demons in Gnosticism]]\n[[Category:Gnostic deities]]\n[[Category:Names of God in Gnosticism]]\n[[Category:Platonic deities]]", "sha1": "l0knoxk3mqbfemk12pqe6h7g8r6570x"}}, {"title": "Doubravka of Bohemia", "ns": "0", "id": "8798", "revision": {"id": "851748239", "parentid": "834433838", "timestamp": "2018-07-24T10:23:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "ArisMethymna", "id": "22307207"}, "minor": "", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses|Dubravka (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox royalty\n|consort=yes\n| name            = Doubravka of Bohemia\n| succession      = [[List of Polish consorts|Duchess consort of the Polans]]\n| image           = Dobrawa.jpg\n| caption         = Dobrawa of Bohemia, by [[Jan Matejko]]\n| reign           = 965\u2013977\n| spouse          = [[Mieszko I of Poland]]\n| issue           = [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]]<br> possibly [[Sigrid the Haughty]]<br>(?)

Modern historians believe, however, that the change of religion by Mieszko was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement concluded soon before his marriage with Dobrawa. Her role in his conversion is not considered now to be as important as it is often represented in medieval chronicles.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Date of birth ===\nDobrawa's date of birth is not known. The only indication is communicated by the chronicler [[Cosmas of Prague]], who stated that the Bohemian princess at the time of her marriage with Mieszko I was ''an old woman''.<ref>''Chronicle of Cosmas of Prague'': translated, introduction and commentary developed by Maria Wojciechowska, Warsaw 1968, lib. I cap. 27, p. 149.</ref> The passage is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, and some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent.<ref>H. \u0141owmia\u0144ski, ''Religia S\u0142owian i jej upadek'', Warsaw p. 338, footnote 889.</ref> It is possible that in the statement about Dobrawa's age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Dobrawa as \"old.\" (The word ''Mlada'' means ''Young''). It{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} also found that Cosmas confuses Dobrawa with Mieszko I's second wife [[Oda von Haldensleben|Oda]], who at the time of her marriage was around 19\u201325 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages. Some researchers have taken up speculative views, such as [[Jerzy Strzelczyk]], who assumed that ''in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Dobrawa had passed her early youth, so, it's probable that she was in her late teens or twenties''.<ref>J. Strzelczyk, ''Boles\u0142aw Chrobry'', p. 15.</ref>\n\n===Early years===\nNothing is known about Dobrawa's childhood and youth. In 1895 [[Oswald Balzer]] refuted reports that previous to her marriage with Mieszko I, Dobrawa was married to [[Gunther, Margrave of Merseburg]] and they had a son, [[Gunzelin, Margrave of Meissen|Gunzelin]]. This view is based on the fact that [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] in his chronicles named Gunzelin, Gunther's son, ''brother'' of Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, Dobrawa's son.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. V, cap. 18, p. 274; vol. V, cap. 36, p. 300; vol. VI, cap. 54, p. 390.</ref> Currently, historians believed that Gunzelin and Boles\u0142aw I are in fact cousins or brothers-in-law.<ref>View, inter alia, of Herbert Ludat.</ref>\n\n===Marriage with Mieszko I and role in the Christianization of Poland===\nIn the second half of 964<ref>Date fixed by H. \u0141owmia\u0144ski, ''Pocz\u0105tki Polski'', vol. V, p. 548.</ref>  an alliance between Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, and Mieszko I of [[Poland]] was concluded. In order to consolidate the agreement, in 965 Boleslav I's daughter Dobrawa was married to Mieszko I.  There was a difference of religion between the spouses; she was a Christian, he was a pagan.\n\nTwo independent sources attribute to Dobrawa an important role in the conversion to Christianity of Mieszko I and Poland. The first is the chronicles of Thietmar, who was born two years before the death of Dobrawa. He wrote that the Bohemian princess tried to persuade her husband to accept Christianity (even at the cost of breaking their marriage and with it the [[Polish-Bohemian Alliance]]). In the end, she finally obtained the conversion of Mieszko I and with him, of all Poland.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. IV, cap. 56.</ref>\n\nIn turn, the 12th century chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] says that Dobrawa came to Poland surrounded by secular and religious dignitaries. She agreed to marry Mieszko I providing that he was baptized. The Polish ruler accepted, and only then was able to marry the Bohemian princess.\n\nHowever, modern historians allege that the baptism of Mieszko I was dictated by political benefits and should not be attributed to any action of Dobrawa, who according to the modern view had virtually no role in the conversion of her husband.<ref>J. Dowiat, ''Metryka chrztu Mieszka I'', p. 79; Andrzej Feliks Grabski, ''Boles\u0142aw Chrobry. Zarys dziej\u00f3w politycznych i wojskowych'', p. 26; S. Trawkowski, ''Monarchia Mieszka I i Boles\u0142awa Chrobrego,'' pp. 116-117; H. \u0141owmia\u0144ski, ''Pocz\u0105tki Polski'', vol. V, p. 549.</ref> They note that the conversion of Mieszko I thanks to Dobrawa formed part of the tradition of the Church which stressed the conversion of Pagan rulers through the influence of women.<ref>A. F. Grabski, ''Mieszko I'', Warsaw 1973, p. 93.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, literature doesn't refuse to give Dobrawa a significant role in the Christianization of the Poles. In her wedding procession, she arrived in Poland with Christian clergymen, among them possibly [[Jordan (Bishop of Poland)|Jordan]], ordained the first [[Bishop of Pozna\u0144|Bishop of Poland]] in 968. Tradition attributes to Dobrawa the establishment of the Holy Trinity and St. Wit Churches in [[Gniezno]] and the Church of the Virgin Mary in [[Ostr\u00f3w Tumski, Pozna\u0144|Ostr\u00f3w Tumski]], [[Pozna\u0144]].\n\nDobrawa's marriage cemented the alliance of Mieszko I with Bohemia, which continued even after her death. On 21 September 967 Mieszko I was assisted by Bohemians in the decisive battle against the [[Wolinians]] led by [[Wichmann the Younger]].\n\nWhen, after the death of [[Otto I the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 973, a struggle for the supremacy in [[Germany]] began, both Dobrawa's husband and brother [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav II the Pious]], Duke of Bohemia, supported the same candidate for the German throne, Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II of Bavaria]].\n\n===Issue===\n[[File:POL Warsaw Pa\u0142ac Ursyn\u00f3w9.jpg|thumbnail|270px|right|Bust in the Krasinski palace, [[Ursyn\u00f3w]], [[Warsaw]]]]\nThe marriage of Mieszko I and Dobrawa produced three children:\n# [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Boles\u0142aw I the Brave (''Chrobry'')]] (b. 967 - d. 17 June 1025).\n# a daughter, perhaps named [[\u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa]], perhaps identical to the legendary [[Sigrid the Haughty]] (b. 968/72 - d. ca. 1016), perhaps married firstly with [[Eric VI of Sweden|Eric the Victorious]], King of [[Sweden]], and later wife of [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of [[Denmark]], by whom she is said to have been mother of [[Canute the Great]], King of Denmark, [[Norway]] and [[England]]. [[Gunhilda of Poland]], who married Swyen I \"Forkbeard\", King of Denmark and England, is usually identified with Sigrid.\n# There is an hypothesis asserting the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married to a Pomeranian Slavic Prince.

He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=44}} He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had \"single-point fueling\" capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight\u2014a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary\u2014and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] paramilitary units.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}\n\nIn addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, [[fence (criminal)|fence]] it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence only brought in at the trial.<ref>Acamstoday, The Lindbergh Case: How Bankers Helped Solve It http://www.acamstoday.org/the-lindberg-case-how-banker-helped-solve-it/</ref>\n\nAlthough unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of [[skydiver]]s, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of [[World War II]] aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains.<ref>Survival Probability Analysis of the D.B.

The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.\" Furthermore, \"if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.\"<ref name = \"conclusions\" />\n\nThe Bureau were more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. \"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a [[paratrooper]],\" said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. \"We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky.

Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a \"rounded\" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nBut the \"free floating\" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank \"within a couple of years\" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 |format=PDF |access-date=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035908/http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Subsequent FBI disclosures|Subsequent FBI disclosures]] above).<ref name=\"conclusions\">[http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html ''Research Conclusions'': Cooper Research Team web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125233029/http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html |date=November 25, 2011 }}.

The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in [[Japan]] with [[Allied occupation of Japan|occupation forces]] in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army, he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the [[South Sea Islands|South Pacific]], and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a [[purser]], based in Seattle.<ref name=\"Gray-NYmag2007-10-21\" /> Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5&nbsp;ft 8 in or 173&nbsp;cm), thinner (150 pounds or 68&nbsp;kg), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions.<ref name=\"Gray-NYmag2007-10-21\" /> Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage).

He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. However he did not have room in his truck to pick him up. He continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Caf\u00e9 just outside of Cle Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the caf\u00e9 looking like a \"drowned rat\", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the cafe. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.\n\nLaurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the caf\u00e9, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him \"Cowboy\".\n\nLaurin consulted a map to find these particular landmarks and began making phone calls about the \"Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.\" Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and who confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_lived_and_died_in_mi.html|title=D.B.

K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] drew together the disparate experiences of the various cooperatives and [[friendly society|friendly societies]] in Northern England, Ireland, and Northern Europe into a coherent political ideology which specifically advocated widespread private ownership of housing and control of industry through owner-operated small businesses and worker-controlled cooperatives. In the United States in the 1930s, distributism was treated in numerous essays by Chesterton, Belloc and others in ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published and edited by [[Seward Collins]]. Pivotal among Belloc's and Chesterton's other works regarding distributism are ''[[The Servile State]]'',<ref>Hilaire Belloc, ''The Servile State'', The Liberty Fund, originally published 1913.</ref> and ''Outline of Sanity''.<ref>G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/Sanity.txt ''The Outline of Sanity''], IHS Press, 2002, originally published 1927.</ref>\n\nAlthough a majority of distributism's later supporters were not Catholics and many were in fact former [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] socialists who had become disillusioned with socialism, distributist thought was adopted by the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], conjoining it with the thought of [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Peter Maurin]] concerning localized and independent communities. It also influenced the thought behind the [[Antigonish Movement]], which implemented cooperatives and other measures to aid the poor in the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Its practical implementation in the form of local cooperatives has been documented by [[Race Mathews]] in his 1999 book ''Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stakeholder Society''.\n\n==Position within the political spectrum==\n[[File:Triangle of economic systems.png|250px|thumb|Distributism is more than a compromise between socialism and capitalism.]]\n[[File:William Cobbett.JPG|250px|thumb|[[William Cobbett]]'s social views influenced Chesterton.]]\nThe position of distributists when compared to other political philosophies is somewhat paradoxical and complicated (see [[Triangulation (politics)|Triangulation]]). Strongly entrenched in an [[Organic (model)|organic]] but very [[Catholic Church in England and Wales|English Catholicism]], advocating culturally traditionalist and [[agrarianism|agrarian]] values, directly challenging the precepts of [[Whig history]]\u2014Belloc was nonetheless an MP for the Liberal Party and Chesterton once stated \"As much as I ever did, more than I ever did, I believe in Liberalism. But there was a rosy time of innocence when I believed in Liberals.\"<ref name=\"orthodoxy\">{{cite book | last=Chesterton | first=G. K. | title=Orthodoxy | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2008 | page=49 | isbn=978-0-554-33475-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wl2QyGUL0EC&pg=PA49 }}</ref> This [[liberalism]] is different from most modern forms, taking influence from [[William Cobbett]] and [[John Ruskin]], who combined elements of [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], challenging the establishment position, but from a perspective of renovation, not revolution; seeing themselves as trying to restore the traditional liberties of England and her people which had been taken away from them, amongst other things, since the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nWhile converging with certain elements of traditional [[Toryism]], especially an appreciation of the [[Middle Ages]] and organic society, there were several points of significant contention. While many Tories were strongly opposed to reform, the distributists in certain cases saw this not as conserving a legitimate traditional concept of England, but in many cases, entrenching harmful errors and innovations. Belloc was quite explicit in his opposition to [[Protestantism]] as a concept and [[schism (religion)|schism]] from the Catholic Church in general, considering the division of [[Christendom]] in the 16th century one of the most harmful events in European history. Elements of Toryism on the other hand were quite intransigent when it came to the [[Church of England]] as the established church, some even spurning their original [[Legitimists|legitimist]] ultra-royalist principles in regards to [[James II of England|James II]] to uphold it.\n\nMuch of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' writings on social and economic matters has affinity with distributism. She may have been influenced by them, or have come to similar conclusions on her own; as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], the reasonings she gave are rooted in the theologies of [[genesis creation narrative|Creation]] and [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and thus are slightly different from the Catholic Chesterton and Belloc.\n\n==Economic theory==\n\n===Private property===\n[[File:Three acres and a cow.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Self-portrait of [[G. K. Chesterton]] based on the distributist slogan \"[[Three acres and a cow]]\".]]\nUnder such a system, most people would be able to earn a living without having to rely on the use of the [[private property|property]] of others to do so. Examples of people earning a living in this way would be farmers who own their own land and related machinery, carpenters and plumbers who own their own tools, etc.  The \"cooperative\" approach advances beyond this perspective to recognise that such property and equipment may be \"co-owned\" by local communities larger than a family, e.g., partners in a business.\n\nIn ''Rerum novarum'', Leo XIII states that people are likely to work harder and with greater commitment if they themselves possess the land on which they labour, which in turn will benefit them and their families, as workers will be able to provide for themselves and their household. He puts forward the idea that when men have the opportunity to possess property and work on it, they will \u201clearn to love the very soil which yields in response to the labor of their hands, not only food to eat, but an abundance of the good things for themselves and those that are dear to them\u201d. <ref>Pope Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'' : 47, 1891</ref> He states also that owning property is not only beneficial for a person and their family, but is in fact a right, due to God having \u201c...given the earth for the use and enjoyment of the whole human race\u201d.<ref>Pope Leo XIII, ''Rerum novarum'':  8, 1891.</ref>\n\nSimilar views are presented by [[G. K. Chesterton]] in his 1910 book ''What\u2019s Wrong with the World''.  Chesterton believes that whilst God has limitless capabilities, man has limited abilities in terms of creation. As such, man therefore is entitled to own property and to treat it as he sees fit. He states \u201cProperty is merely the art of the democracy. It means that every man should have something that he can shape in his own image, as he is shaped in the image of heaven. But because he is not God, but only a graven image of God, his self-expression must deal with limits; properly with limits that are strict and even small.\u201d<ref>Chesterton, Gilbert Keith, ''What\u2019s Wrong with the World'' (1920), p. 59.</ref> Chesterton summed up his distributist views in the phrase \"[[Three acres and a cow]]\".\n\nAccording to Belloc, the distributive state (the state which has implemented distributism) contains \"an agglomeration of families of varying wealth, but by far the greater number of owners of the means of production\". This broader distribution does not extend to all property, but only to productive property; that is, that property which produces wealth, namely, the things needed for man to survive. It includes land, tools, and so on.<ref>Hilaire Belloc, ''[[The Servile State]]'', 1913.</ref> Distributism allows for society to have public goods such as parks and transit systems.\n\n===Guild system===\nThe kind of economic order envisaged by the early distributist thinkers would involve the return to some sort of [[guild]] system. The present existence of [[trade union|labor unions]] does not constitute a realization of this facet of distributist economic order, as labour unions are organized along [[Social class|class]] lines to promote class interests and frequently [[class struggle]], whereas guilds are mixed class syndicates composed of both employers and employees cooperating for mutual benefit, thereby promoting [[class collaboration]].\n\n===Banks===\nDistributism favors the dissolution of the current [[private bank]] system, or more specifically its [[Profit (economics)|profit]]-making basis in charging interest. Dorothy Day, for example, suggested<ref>Considine, Kevin. [https://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201603/it-sinful-charge-interest-loan-30591 ''Is it sinful to charge interest on a loan?''] ''U.S. Catholic'', 17 March 2016. Retrieved 18 July 2018.</ref> abolishing legal enforcement of interest-rate contracts ([[usury]]). It would not entail [[nationalization]] but could involve government involvement of some sort. Distributists look favorably on [[credit union]]s as a preferable alternative to banks.\n\n===Anti-trust legislation===\nDistributism appears to have one of its greatest influences in [[anti-trust legislation]] in America and Europe designed to break up monopolies and excessive concentration of market power in one or only a few companies, [[trust (monopoly)|trust]]s, interests, or [[cartel]]s.  Embodying the philosophy explained by Chesterton, above, that too much capitalism means too few capitalists, not too many, America's extensive system of anti-trust legislation seeks to prevent the concentration of market power in a given industry into too few hands.  Requiring that no company gain too great a share of any market is an example of how distributism has found its way into [[competition law|government policy]].  The assumption behind this legislation is the idea that having economic activity decentralized among many different industry participants is better for the economy than having one or a few large players in an industry.  (Note that anti-trust regulation does take into account cases when only large companies are viable because of the nature of an industry, as in the case of [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] like electricity distribution. It also accepts that mergers and acquisitions may improve consumer welfare; however, it generally prefers more [[agent (economics)|economic agents]] to fewer, as this generally improves [[competition (economics)|competition]].)\n\n===Social credit===\n[[Social credit]] is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by [[C. H. Douglas]] (1879\u20131952), a British engineer, who wrote a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses the fields of economics, political science, history, accounting, and physics. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals.\n\n==Social theory==\n\n===Human family===\nDistributism sees the family of two parents and their child or children as the central and primary [[social unit]] of human ordering and the principal unit of a functioning distributist society and civilization. This unit is also the basis of a multi-generational [[extended family]], which is embedded in socially as well as genetically inter-related communities, nations, etc., and ultimately in the whole human family past, present and future. The economic system of a society should therefore be focused primarily on the flourishing of the family unit, but not in isolation: at the appropriate level of family context, as is intended in the principle of subsidiarity. Distributism reflects this doctrine most evidently by promoting the family, rather than the individual, as the basic type of owner; that is, distributism seeks to ensure that most families, rather than most individuals, will be owners of productive property. The family is, then, vitally important to the very core of distributist thought.\n\n===Subsidiarity===\n{{Main article|Subsidiarity}}\nDistributism puts great emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity.  This principle holds that no larger unit (whether social, economic, or political) should perform a function which can be performed by a smaller unit.  [[Pope Pius XI]], in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', provided the classical statement of the principle:  \"Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community, so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do.\"<ref name = \"uywdmd\">Pope Pius XI, ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno_en.html Quadragesimo anno]'', 1931.</ref>  Thus, any activity of production (which distributism holds to be the most important part of any economy) ought to be performed by the smallest possible unit.  This helps support distributism's argument that smaller units, families if possible, ought to be in control of the means of production, rather than the large units typical of modern economies.\n\n[[Pope Pius XI]] further stated, again in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'', \"every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social, and never destroy and absorb them\".<ref name = \"uywdmd\"/> To prevent large private organizations from thus dominating the body politic, distributism applies this principle of subsidiarity to economic as well as to social and political action.\n\n===Social security===\nDistributism favors the elimination of [[social security]] on the basis that it further alienates man by making him more dependent on the [[The Servile State|Servile State]]. Distributists such as [[Dorothy Day]] did not favor social security when it was introduced by the United States government. This rejection of this new program was due to the direct influence of the ideas of [[Hilaire Belloc]] over American Distributists.\n\n===Society of artisans===\nDistributism promotes a society of [[artisan]]s and culture. This is influenced by an emphasis on small business, promotion of local culture, and favoring of small production over capitalistic [[mass production]]. A society of artisans promotes the distributist ideal of the unification of capital, ownership, and production rather than what distributism sees as an [[social alienation|alienation]] of man from work.\n\nThis does not, however, suggest that distributism necessarily favors a technological regression to a pre-[[Industrial Revolution]] lifestyle, but a more local ownership of factories and other industrial centers. Products such as food and clothing would be preferably returned to local producers and artisans instead of being mass-produced overseas.\n\n==Geopolitical theory==\n\n===Political order===\nDistributism does not favor one political order over another ([[political accidentalism]]). While some distributists, such as Dorothy Day, have been [[anarchism|anarchists]], it should be remembered that most Chestertonian distributists are opposed to the mere concept of anarchism. Chesterton thought that Distributism would benefit from the discipline that theoretical analysis imposes, and that distributism is best seen as a widely encompassing concept inside of which any number of interpretations and perspectives can fit. This concept should fit in a political system broadly characterized by widespread ownership of productive property.<ref>G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/Sanity.txt ''The Outline of Sanity''](Norfolk, Va.: IHS Press, 2001), p. 90</ref>\n\n===Political parties===\nThe Brazilian political party, [[Humanist Party of Solidarity]] is a distributist party, and distributism has influenced [[List of Christian democratic parties|Christian Democratic parties]] in Continental Europe and the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]] in Australia. [[Ross Douthat]] and [[Reihan Salam]] view their ''Grand New Party'', a roadmap for revising the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party in the United States]], as \"a book written in the distributist tradition\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Ross Douthat |url=https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT/statuses/317053001070161920 |title=Twitter post |date=27 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===War===\nDistributists usually use [[Just War Theory]] in determining whether a war should be fought or not. Historical positions of distributist thinkers provide insight into a distributist position on war. Both Belloc and Chesterton opposed British imperialism in general, as well as specifically opposing the [[Second Boer War]], but supported British involvement in [[World War I]].\n\nOn the other hand, prominent distributists such as Dorothy Day and those involved in the Catholic Worker Movement were/are strict [[pacifism|pacifists]], even to the point of condemning involvement in [[World War II]] at much personal cost.\n\n==Influence==\n\n===E. F. Schumacher===\nDistributism is known to have had an influence on the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]],<ref>Opdebeeck, Hendrik, ed. Frontiers of Business Ethics, Volume 11 : Responsible Economics : E. F. Schumacher and His Legacy for the 21st Century. Oxford, GBR: Peter Lang AG, 2013. Page 12.</ref> a convert to Catholicism.\n\n===Mondragon Corporation===\nThe [[Mondragon Corporation]], based in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] in a region of Spain and France, was founded by a Catholic priest, Father [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta]], who seems to have been influenced by the same Catholic social and economic teachings that inspired Belloc, Chesterton, Father [[Vincent McNabb]], and the other founders of distributism.<ref>Mathews, Race. ''Jobs of Our Own: Building a Stakeholder Society.'' Fernwood Publishing. 1999.</ref>\n\n===Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic===\nDistributist ideas were put into practice by [[The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic]], a group of artists and craftsmen who established a community in [[Ditchling]], Sussex, England, in 1920, with the motto \"Men rich in virtue studying beautifulness living in peace in their houses\". The Guild sought to recreate an idealised medieval lifestyle in the manner of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]; it survived almost 70 years, until 1989.\n\n===Big Society===\n\nThe [[Big Society]] was the flagship policy idea of the 2010 [[List of UK Conservative Party general election manifestos|UK Conservative Party general election manifesto]]. Some distributists claim that the rhetorical marketing of this policy was influenced by aphorisms of the distributist ideology and promotes distributism.<ref name=DR21Jul>[http://distributistreview.com/mag/2010/07/a-potential-step-in-the-right-direction/ A Potential Step in the Right Direction] 21 July 2010</ref> It purportedly formed a part of the legislative programme of the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]].<ref name = BBC18May>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8688860.stm Cameron and Clegg set out 'big society' policy ideas] [[BBC]] News 18-May-2010</ref> The stated aim was \"to create a climate that empowers local people and communities, building a big society that will 'take power away from politicians and give it to people.'\"<ref name=PM18May>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/big-society-50248 Government launches \u201cBig Society\u201d programme] [[10 Downing Street]] website 18-May-2010</ref> The idea of the Big Society was suggested by [[Steve Hilton]], who worked as director of strategy for David Cameron during the Coalition government before moving on to live and work in California.\n\n==Early distributists==\n* [[Herbert Agar]]\n* [[Hilaire Belloc]]\n* Harold Robbins<ref>[http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/articles/175.pdf \"Distributism Versus Capitalism\"], Dorothy Day, ''The Catholic Worker'', October 1954.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesterton.org/shop/last-of-the-realists/|title=Last of the Realists - American Chesterton Society|website=American Chesterton Society|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n* [[L.

However, its [[intrinsic activity]] at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to [[competitive inhibition|competition]] for [[molecular binding|binding]] with [[full agonist]]s like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) levels, and hence, like an [[antiandrogen]]. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.<ref name=\"pmid15994348\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen F, Knecht K, Birzin E, Fisher J, Wilkinson H, Mojena M, Moreno CT, Schmidt A, Harada S, Freedman LP, Reszka AA | title = Direct agonist/antagonist functions of dehydroepiandrosterone | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 146 | issue = 11 | pages = 4568\u201376 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 15994348 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-0368 | url = http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15994348 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid16159155\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao W, Bohl CE, Dalton JT | title = Chemistry and structural biology of androgen receptor | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 105 | issue = 9 | pages = 3352\u201370 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16159155 | pmc = 2096617 | doi = 10.1021/cr020456u }}</ref>\n\n====Estrogen receptors====\nIn addition to its affinity for the androgen receptor, DHEA has also been found to bind to and activate the [[Estrogen receptor alpha|ER\u03b1]] and [[Estrogen receptor beta|ER\u03b2]] [[estrogen receptor]]s with K<sub>i</sub> values of 1.1 \u03bcM and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively, and [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values of >1 \u03bcM and 200 nM, respectively. Though it was found to be a partial agonist of the ER\u03b1 with a maximal efficacy of 30\u201370%, the concentrations required for this degree of activation make it unlikely that the activity of DHEA at this receptor is physiologically meaningful. Remarkably however, DHEA acts as a full agonist of the ER\u03b2 with a maximal response similar to or actually slightly greater than that of [[estradiol]], and its levels in circulation and local tissues in the human body are high enough to activate the receptor to the same degree as that seen with circulating estradiol levels at somewhat higher than their maximal, non-[[ovulation|ovulatory]] concentrations; indeed, when combined with estradiol with both at levels equivalent to those of their physiological concentrations, overall activation of the ER\u03b2 was doubled.

During the medication with this compound, the most remarkable improvements are found in the grade of depression, anxiety and their physical consequences (for example, a tendency toward exhaustion). It suggests that dehydroepiandrosterone is playing an important role at the neurosteroidal level. The reason for that is that dehydroepiandrosterone is the precursor of androgens in women and it is widely known that women with adrenal insufficiency experiment a broad decrease of active androgens. A single daily dose of 50 mg of dehydroepiandrosterone overcomes this deficiency. <ref>Wiebke Arlt, M.D., Frank Callies, M.D., Jan Christoph Van Vlijmen, Ines Koehler, Martin Reincke, M.D., Martin Bidlingmaier, et al.

The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.  An inverse DFT is a [[Fourier series]], using the DTFT samples as coefficients of [[complex number|complex]] [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.  It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.  The DFT is therefore said to be a [[frequency domain]] representation of the original input sequence.  If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle.  If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.\n\nThe DFT is the most important [[discrete transform]], used to perform [[Fourier analysis]] in many practical applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strang|first=Gilbert|title=Wavelets|journal=American Scientist|date=May\u2013June 1994|volume=82|issue=3|pages=250\u2013255|jstor=29775194|quote=This is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime...}}</ref>  In [[digital signal processing]], the function is any quantity or [[signal (information theory)|signal]] that varies over time, such as the pressure of a [[sound wave]], a [[radio]] signal, or daily [[temperature]] readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a [[window function]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sahidullah|first=Md.|author2=Saha, Goutam|title=A Novel Windowing Technique for Efficient Computation of MFCC for Speaker Recognition|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date=Feb 2013|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149\u2013152|doi=10.1109/LSP.2012.2235067|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6387265&isnumber=6380557|arxiv = 1206.2437 |bibcode = 2013ISPL...20..149S }}</ref>).

This orthogonality condition can be used to derive the formula for the IDFT from the definition of the DFT, and is equivalent to the unitarity property below.\n\n=== The Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem ===\nIf ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> and ''Y''<sub>''k''</sub> are the DFTs of ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> respectively then the [[Parseval's theorem]] states:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n y^*_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k Y^*_k</math>\n\nwhere the star denotes [[Complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].

The choice above, however, is typical because it has two useful properties.  First, it consists of sinusoids whose frequencies have the smallest possible magnitudes: the interpolation is [[bandlimited]]. Second, if the  <math>x_n</math> are real numbers, then <math>p(t)</math> is real as well.\n\nIn contrast, the most obvious trigonometric interpolation polynomial is the one in which the frequencies range from 0 to <math>N-1</math> (instead of roughly <math>-N/2</math> to <math>+N/2</math> as above), similar to the inverse DFT formula. This interpolation does ''not'' minimize the slope, and is ''not'' generally real-valued for real <math>x_n</math>; its use is a common mistake.\n\n=== The unitary DFT ===\nAnother way of looking at the DFT is to note that in the above discussion, the DFT can be expressed as the [[DFT matrix]], a [[Vandermonde matrix]], \n[[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices|introduced by Sylvester]] in 1867,\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot 0}     & \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot 1}     & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot (N-1)}     \\\\\n \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot 0}     & \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot 1}     & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot (N-1)}     \\\\\n \\vdots                   & \\vdots                   & \\ddots & \\vdots                       \\\\\n \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot 0} & \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot 1} & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot (N-1)} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\omega_N = e^{-2 \\pi i/N}\\,</math>\nis a primitive [[roots of unity|Nth root of unity]].\n\nThe inverse transform is then given by the inverse of the above matrix,\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{F}^*</math>\n\nWith [[unitary operator|unitary]] normalization constants <math>1/\\sqrt{N}</math>, the DFT becomes a [[unitary transformation]], defined by a unitary matrix:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{F}/\\sqrt{N}</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}^{-1}=\\mathbf{U}^*</math>\n:<math>|\\det(\\mathbf{U})|=1</math>\nwhere <math>\\det()</math> is the [[determinant]] function. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which are always <math>\\pm 1</math> or <math>\\pm i</math> as described below.  In a real vector space, a unitary transformation can be thought of as simply a rigid rotation of the coordinate system, and all of the properties of a rigid rotation can be found in the unitary DFT.\n\nThe orthogonality of the DFT is now expressed as an [[orthonormal]]ity condition (which arises in many areas of mathematics as described in [[root of unity]]):\n:<math>\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}U_{km}U_{mn}^*=\\delta_{kn}</math>\n\nIf '''X'''  is defined as the unitary DFT of the vector '''x''', then\n:<math>X_k=\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{kn}x_n</math>\n\nand the [[Plancherel theorem]] is expressed as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n y_n^* = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k Y_k^*</math>\n\nIf we view the DFT as just a coordinate transformation which simply specifies the components of a vector in a new coordinate system, then the above is just the statement that the dot product of two vectors is preserved under a unitary DFT transformation. For the special case <math>\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}</math>, this implies that the length of a vector is preserved as well\u2014this is just [[Parseval's theorem]],\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|x_n|^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|X_k|^2</math>\n\nA consequence of the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]] is that the DFT matrix {{mvar|F}} diagonalizes any [[circulant matrix]].\n\n=== Expressing the inverse DFT in terms of the DFT ===\nA useful property of the DFT is that the inverse DFT can be easily expressed in terms of the (forward) DFT, via several well-known \"tricks\".  (For example, in computations, it is often convenient to only implement a fast Fourier transform corresponding to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first.)\n\nFirst, we can compute the inverse DFT by reversing all but one of the inputs (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988):\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\{x_n\\}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\{x_{N - n}\\}) / N</math>\n\n(As usual, the subscripts are interpreted [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N''; thus, for <math>n=0</math>, we have <math>x_{N-0}=x_0</math>.)\n\nSecond, one can also conjugate the inputs and outputs:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}^*)^* / N</math>\n\nThird, a variant of this conjugation trick, which is sometimes preferable because it requires no modification of the data values, involves swapping real and imaginary parts (which can be done on a computer simply by modifying [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s). Define swap(<math>x_n</math>) as <math>x_n</math> with its real and imaginary parts swapped\u2014that is, if <math>x_n = a + b i</math> then swap(<math>x_n</math>) is <math>b + a i</math>.  Equivalently, swap(<math>x_n</math>) equals <math>i x_n^*</math>.  Then\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\textrm{swap}(\\mathcal{F}(\\textrm{swap}(\\mathbf{x}))) / N</math>\n\nThat is, the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output, up to a normalization (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988).\n\nThe conjugation trick can also be used to define a new transform, closely related to the DFT, that is [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]]\u2014that is, which is its own inverse.  In particular, <math>T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}^*) / \\sqrt{N}</math> is clearly its own inverse: <math>T(T(\\mathbf{x})) = \\mathbf{x}</math>.  A closely related involutory transformation (by a factor of (1+''i'') /{{radic|2}}) is <math>H(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}((1+i) \\mathbf{x}^*) / \\sqrt{2N}</math>, since the <math>(1+i)</math> factors in <math>H(H(\\mathbf{x}))</math> cancel the 2.  For real inputs <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, the real part of <math>H(\\mathbf{x})</math> is none other than the [[discrete Hartley transform]], which is also involutory.\n\n=== Eigenvalues and eigenvectors ===\n\nThe [[eigenvalue]]s of the DFT matrix are simple and well-known, whereas the [[eigenvector]]s are complicated, not unique, and are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nConsider the unitary form <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> defined above for the DFT of length ''N'', where\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}_{m,n} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\omega_N^{(m-1)(n-1)} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}e^{-\\frac{2\\pi i}N (m-1)(n-1)}.</math>\nThis matrix satisfies the [[matrix polynomial]] equation:\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}^4 = \\mathbf{I}.</math>\nThis can be seen from the inverse properties above: operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> twice gives the original data in reverse order, so operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> four times gives back the original data and is thus the [[identity matrix]].  This means that the eigenvalues <math>\\lambda</math> satisfy the equation:\n:<math>\\lambda^4 = 1.</math>\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> are the fourth [[roots of unity]]: <math>\\lambda</math> is +1, \u22121, +''i'',  or \u2212''i''.\n\nSince there are only four distinct eigenvalues for this <math>N\\times N</math> matrix, they have some [[algebraic multiplicity|multiplicity]].  The multiplicity gives the number of [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.  (Note that there are ''N'' independent eigenvectors; a unitary matrix is never [[defective matrix|defective]].)\n\nThe problem of their multiplicity was solved by McClellan and Parks (1972), although it was later shown to have been equivalent to a problem solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982).  The multiplicity depends on the value of ''N'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4, and is given by the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" | Multiplicities of the eigenvalues \u03bb of the unitary DFT matrix '''U''' as a function of the transform size ''N'' (in terms of an integer ''m'').\n|-\n! size ''N''\n! \u03bb = +1\n! \u03bb = \u22121\n! \u03bb = -''i''\n! \u03bb = +''i''\n|-\n|    4''m''  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m'' \u2212 1\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 2  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 3  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''\n|}\n\nOtherwise stated, the [[characteristic polynomial]] of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> is:\n:<math>\\det (\\lambda I - \\mathbf{U})=\n(\\lambda-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+4}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+2}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda-i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N-1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}.</math>\n\nNo simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors is known.   Moreover, the eigenvectors are not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue is also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue.  Various researchers have proposed different choices of eigenvectors, selected to satisfy useful properties like [[orthogonality]] and to have \"simple\" forms (e.g., McClellan and Parks, 1972; Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982; Gr\u00fcnbaum, 1982; Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997; Candan ''et al.'', 2000; Hanna ''et al.'', 2004; Gurevich and Hadani, 2008).\n\nA straightforward approach is to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous [[Fourier transform]],\nof which the most famous is the [[Gaussian function]].\nSince [[periodic summation]] of the function means discretizing its frequency spectrum\nand discretization means periodic summation of the spectrum,\nthe discretized and periodically summed Gaussian function yields an eigenvector of the discrete transform:\n*<math>F(m) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi\\cdot(m+N\\cdot k)^2}{N}\\right)</math>.\n\nThe closed form expression for the series can be expressed by\n[[Jacobi theta functions]] as\n\n*<math>F(m) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\vartheta_3\\left(\\frac{\\pi m}N, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}N \\right)\\right)</math>.\n\nTwo other simple closed-form analytical eigenvectors for special DFT period ''N'' were found (Kong, 2008):\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' + 1 = 4''K'' +1, where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\prod_{s=K+1}^L\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' = 4''K'', where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)\\prod_{s=K+1}^{L-1}\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nThe choice of eigenvectors of the DFT matrix has become important in recent years in order to define a discrete analogue of the [[fractional Fourier transform]]\u2014the DFT matrix can be taken to fractional powers by exponentiating the eigenvalues (e.g., Rubio and Santhanam, 2005).  For the [[continuous Fourier transform]], the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions are the [[Hermite function]]s, so various discrete analogues of these have been employed as the eigenvectors of the DFT, such as the [[Kravchuk polynomials]] (Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997).  The \"best\" choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete Fourier transform remains an open question, however.\n\n=== Uncertainty principles ===\n==== Probabilistic uncertainty principle ====\nIf the random variable {{math|''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is constrained by\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|X_n|^2=1  ~,</math>\nthen \n:<math>P_n=|X_n|^2</math> \nmay be considered to represent a discrete [[probability mass function]] of {{mvar|n}}, with an associated probability mass function constructed from the transformed variable,\n:<math>Q_m=N|x_m|^2 ~.</math>\n\nFor the case of continuous functions <math>P(x)</math> and <math>Q(k)</math>, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] states that\n:<math>D_0(X)D_0(x)\\ge\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}</math>\nwhere  <math>D_0(X)</math> and <math>D_0(x)</math> are the variances of <math>|X|^2</math> and <math>|x|^2</math> respectively, with the equality attained in the case of a suitably normalized [[Gaussian distribution]]. Although the variances may be analogously defined for the DFT, an analogous uncertainty principle is not useful, because the uncertainty will not be shift-invariant.

This is sometimes known as a '''generalized DFT''' (or '''GDFT'''), also called the '''shifted DFT''' or '''offset DFT''', and has analogous properties to the ordinary DFT:\n\n:<math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\frac{2 \\pi i}{N} (k+b) (n+a)} \\quad \\quad k = 0, \\dots, N-1.</math>\n\nMost often, shifts of <math>1/2</math> (half a sample) are used.\nWhile the ordinary DFT corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domains, <math>a=1/2</math> produces a signal that is anti-periodic in frequency domain (<math>X_{k+N} = - X_k</math>) and vice versa for <math>b=1/2</math>.\nThus, the specific case of <math>a = b = 1/2</math> is known as an ''odd-time odd-frequency'' discrete Fourier transform (or O<sup>2</sup> DFT).\nSuch shifted transforms are most often used for symmetric data, to represent different boundary symmetries, and for real-symmetric data they correspond to different forms of the discrete [[discrete cosine transform|cosine]] and [[discrete sine transform|sine]] transforms.\n\nAnother interesting choice is <math>a=b=-(N-1)/2</math>, which is called the '''centered DFT''' (or '''CDFT''').  The centered DFT has the useful property that, when ''N'' is a multiple of four, all four of its eigenvalues (see above) have equal multiplicities (Rubio and Santhanam, 2005)<ref>Santhanam, Balu; Santhanam, Thalanayar S.

The multidimensional DFT of a multidimensional array <math>x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d}</math> that is a function of ''d'' discrete variables <math>n_\\ell = 0, 1, \\dots, N_\\ell-1</math> for <math>\\ell</math> in <math>1, 2, \\dots, d</math> is defined by:\n\n:<math>X_{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d} = \\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \\left(\\omega_{N_1}^{~k_1 n_1} \\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} \\left( \\omega_{N_2}^{~k_2 n_2} \\cdots \\sum_{n_d=0}^{N_d-1} \\omega_{N_d}^{~k_d n_d}\\cdot x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d} \\right) \\right) \\, , </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_{N_\\ell} = \\exp(-2\\pi i/N_\\ell)</math> as above and the ''d'' output indices run from <math>k_\\ell = 0, 1, \\dots, N_\\ell-1</math>.  This is more compactly expressed in [[coordinate vector|vector]] notation, where we define <math>\\mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d)</math> and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d)</math> as ''d''-dimensional vectors of indices from 0 to <math>\\mathbf{N} - 1</math>, which we define as <math>\\mathbf{N} - 1 = (N_1 - 1, N_2 - 1, \\dots, N_d - 1)</math>:\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{0}}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere the division <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N}</math> is defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = (n_1/N_1, \\dots, n_d/N_d)</math> to be performed element-wise, and the sum denotes the set of nested summations above.\n\nThe inverse of the multi-dimensional DFT is, analogous to the one-dimensional case, given by:\n\n:<math>x_\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{\\ell=1}^d N_\\ell} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{2\\pi i \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} / \\mathbf{N})} X_\\mathbf{k} \\, .</math>\n\nAs the one-dimensional DFT expresses the input <math>x_n</math> as a superposition of sinusoids, the multidimensional DFT expresses the input as a superposition of [[plane wave]]s, or multidimensional sinusoids. The direction of oscillation in space is <math>\\mathbf{k} / \\mathbf{N}</math>. The amplitudes  are <math>X_\\mathbf{k}</math>.  This decomposition is of great importance for everything from [[digital image processing]] (two-dimensional) to solving [[partial differential equations]]. The solution is broken up into plane waves.\n\nThe multidimensional DFT can be computed by the [[function composition|composition]] of a sequence of one-dimensional DFTs along each dimension.  In the two-dimensional case <math>x_{n_1,n_2}</math> the <math>N_1</math> independent DFTs of the rows (i.e., along <math>n_2</math>) are computed first to form a new array <math>y_{n_1,k_2}</math>. Then the <math>N_2</math> independent DFTs of ''y'' along the columns (along <math>n_1</math>) are computed to form the final result <math>X_{k_1,k_2}</math>.  Alternatively the columns can be computed first and then the rows. The order is immaterial because the nested summations above [[commutative operation|commute]].\n\nAn algorithm to compute a one-dimensional DFT is thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional DFT.  This approach is known as the ''row-column'' algorithm. There are also intrinsically [[Fast Fourier transform#Multidimensional FFTs|multidimensional FFT algorithms]].\n\n=== The real-input multidimensional DFT ===\nFor input data <math>x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d}</math> consisting of [[real numbers]], the DFT outputs have a conjugate symmetry similar to the one-dimensional case above:\n\n:<math>X_{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d} = X_{N_1 - k_1, N_2 - k_2, \\dots, N_d - k_d}^* ,</math>\n\nwhere the star again denotes complex conjugation and the <math>\\ell</math>-th subscript is again interpreted modulo <math>N_\\ell</math> (for <math>\\ell = 1,2,\\ldots,d</math>).\n\n== Applications ==\nThe DFT has seen wide usage across a large number of fields; we only sketch a few examples below (see also the references at the end). All applications of the DFT depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete Fourier transforms and their inverses, a [[fast Fourier transform]].\n\n=== Spectral analysis ===\nWhen the DFT is used for [[signal spectral analysis]], the <math>\\{x_n\\}\\,</math> sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal <math>x(t)\\,</math>, where ''t'' represents time.  The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of x(t) into a [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called [[aliasing]].  Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see ''[[Nyquist rate]]'') is the key to minimizing that distortion.  Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called ''[[Spectral leakage|leakage]]'', which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT.  Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect.  When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a [[spectrogram]].  If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the [[variance]] of the spectrum (also called a [[periodogram]] in this context); two examples of such techniques are the [[Welch method]] and the [[Bartlett method]]; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called [[spectral estimation]].\n\nA final source of distortion (or perhaps ''illusion'') is the DFT itself, because it is just a discrete sampling of the DTFT, which is a function of a continuous frequency domain.  That can be mitigated by increasing the resolution of the DFT.  That procedure is illustrated at [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]].\n*The procedure is sometimes referred to as ''zero-padding'', which is a particular implementation used in conjunction with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm.  The inefficiency of performing multiplications and additions with zero-valued \"samples\" is more than offset by the inherent efficiency of the FFT.\n*As already noted, leakage imposes a limit on the inherent resolution of the DTFT.  So there is a practical limit to the benefit that can be obtained from a fine-grained DFT.\n\n=== Filter bank ===\nSee [[Filter bank#FFT filter banks|FFT filter banks]] and [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]].\n\n===Data compression===\nThe field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operations in the frequency domain (i.e. on the Fourier transform). For example, several [[lossy]] image and sound compression methods employ the discrete Fourier transform: the signal is cut into short segments, each is transformed, and then the Fourier coefficients of high frequencies, which are assumed to be unnoticeable, are discarded. The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients. (Compression applications often use a specialized form of the DFT, the [[discrete cosine transform]] or sometimes the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].)\nSome relatively recent compression algorithms, however, use [[wavelet transform]]s, which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtained by chopping data into segments and transforming each segment.  In the case of [[JPEG2000]], this avoids the spurious image features that appear when images are highly compressed with the original [[JPEG]].\n\n===Partial differential equations===\nDiscrete Fourier transforms are often used to solve [[partial differential equations]], where again the DFT is used as an approximation for the [[Fourier series]] (which is recovered in the limit of infinite ''N''). The advantage of this approach is that it expands the signal in complex exponentials <math>e^{inx}</math>, which are eigenfunctions of differentiation: <math>{\\text{d} \\big( e^{inx} \\big) }/\\text{d}x = in e^{inx}</math>. Thus, in the Fourier representation, differentiation is simple\u2014we just multiply by <math>in</math>.  (Note, however, that the choice of <math>n</math> is not unique due to aliasing; for the method to be convergent, a choice similar to that in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Trigonometric interpolation polynomial|trigonometric interpolation]] section above should be used.) A [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients is transformed into an easily solvable algebraic equation. One then uses the inverse DFT to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation. Such an approach is called a [[spectral method]].\n\n===Polynomial multiplication===\n\nSuppose we wish to compute the polynomial product ''c''(''x'') = ''a''(''x'') \u00b7 ''b''(''x'').  The ordinary product expression for the coefficients of ''c'' involves a linear (acyclic) convolution, where indices do not \"wrap around.\"  This can be rewritten as a cyclic convolution by taking the coefficient vectors for ''a''(''x'') and ''b''(''x'') with constant term first, then appending zeros so that the resultant coefficient vectors '''a''' and '''b''' have dimension ''d''&nbsp;>&nbsp;deg(''a''(''x''))&nbsp;+&nbsp;deg(''b''(''x'')).  Then,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{a} * \\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nWhere '''c''' is the vector of coefficients for ''c''(''x''), and the convolution operator <math>*\\,</math> is defined so\n\n:<math>c_n = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1}a_m b_{n-m\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ d} \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad n=0,1\\dots,d-1</math>\n\nBut convolution becomes multiplication under the DFT:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})</math>\n\nHere the vector product is taken elementwise.  Thus the coefficients of the product polynomial ''c''(''x'') are just the terms 0, ..., deg(''a''(''x'')) + deg(''b''(''x'')) of the coefficient vector\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})).</math>\n\nWith a [[fast Fourier transform]], the resulting algorithm takes O (''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') arithmetic operations.  Due to its simplicity and speed, the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]], which is limited to [[composite number|composite]] sizes, is often chosen for the transform operation.  In this case, ''d'' should be chosen as the smallest integer greater than the sum of the input polynomial degrees that is factorizable into small prime factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5, depending upon the FFT implementation).\n\n====Multiplication of large integers====\n\nThe fastest known [[multiplication algorithms|algorithms]] for the multiplication of very large [[integer]]s use the polynomial multiplication method outlined above.  Integers can be treated as the value of a polynomial evaluated specifically at the number base, with the coefficients of the polynomial corresponding to the digits in that base.  After polynomial multiplication, a relatively low-complexity carry-propagation step completes the multiplication.\n\n==== Convolution  ====\nWhen data is [[Convolution|convolved]] with a function with wide support, such as for downsampling by a large sampling ratio, because of the [[Convolution theorem]] and the FFT algorithm, it may be faster to transform it, multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it.  Alternatively, a good filter is obtained by simply truncating the transformed data and re-transforming the shortened data set.\n\n==Some discrete Fourier transform pairs==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Some DFT pairs'''\n|-\n! <math>x_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k  e^{i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n! <math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n  e^{-i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n!

In other words, a sequence of ''n'' complex numbers can be thought of as an element of ''n''-dimensional complex space '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> or equivalently a function ''f'' from the finite cyclic group of order ''n'' to the complex numbers, '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 '''C'''. So  ''f'' is a [[class function]] on the finite cyclic group, and thus can be expressed as a linear combination of the irreducible characters of this group, which are the roots of unity.\n\nFrom this point of view, one may generalize the DFT to representation theory generally, or more narrowly to the [[representation theory of finite groups]].\n\nMore narrowly still, one may generalize the DFT by either changing the target (taking values in a field other than the complex numbers), or the domain (a group other than a finite cyclic group), as detailed in the sequel.\n\n=== Other fields ===\n{{Main|Discrete Fourier transform (general)|Number-theoretic transform}}\nMany of the properties of the DFT only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-\\frac{2 \\pi i}{N}}</math> is a [[primitive root of unity]], sometimes denoted <math>\\omega_N</math> or <math>W_N</math> (so that <math>\\omega_N^N = 1</math>).  Such properties include the completeness, orthogonality, Plancherel/Parseval, periodicity, shift, convolution, and unitarity properties above, as well as many FFT algorithms. For this reason, the discrete Fourier transform can be defined by using roots of unity in [[field (mathematics)|fields]] other than the complex numbers, and such generalizations are commonly called ''number-theoretic transforms'' (NTTs) in the case of [[finite field]]s. For more information, see [[number-theoretic transform]] and [[discrete Fourier transform (general)]].\n\n=== Other finite groups ===\n{{Main|Fourier transform on finite groups}}\nThe standard DFT acts on a sequence ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''&minus;1</sub> of complex numbers, which can be viewed as a function {0, 1, \u2026, ''N'' &minus; 1} \u2192 '''C'''. The multidimensional DFT acts on multidimensional sequences, which can be viewed as functions\n:<math> \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_1-1\\} \\times \\cdots \\times \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_d-1\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}. </math>\nThis suggests the generalization to [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups]], which act on functions ''G'' \u2192 '''C''' where ''G'' is a [[finite group]]. In this framework, the standard DFT is seen as the Fourier transform on a [[cyclic group]], while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\nFurther, Fourier transform can be on cosets of a group.\n\n==Alternatives==\n{{Main|Discrete wavelet transform}}\n{{details|Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform}} There are various alternatives to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are [[wavelets]]. The analog of the DFT is the [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT). From the point of view of [[time\u2013frequency analysis]], a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include ''location'' information, only ''frequency'' information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency.

Vertices of one correspond to faces of the other, and edges correspond to each other.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], any [[polyhedron]] is associated with a second '''dual''' figure, where the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of one correspond to the [[face (geometry)|face]]s of the other and the edges between pairs of vertices of one correspond to the edges between pairs of faces of the other.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, \"Basic notions about stellation and duality\", p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Such dual figures remain combinatorial or [[abstract polytope|abstract polyhedra]], but not all are also geometric polyhedra.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|2003}}</ref> Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron.\n\nDuality preserves the [[symmetry|symmetries]] of a polyhedron. Therefore, for many classes of polyhedra defined by their symmetries, the duals also belong to a symmetric class. Thus, the regular polyhedra{{snd}}the (convex) [[Platonic solid]]s and (star) [[Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra]]{{snd}}form dual pairs, where the regular [[tetrahedron]] is [[#Self-dual polyhedra|self-dual]].  The dual of an isogonal polyhedron, having equivalent vertices, is one which is isohedral, having equivalent faces. The dual of an  [[isotoxal figure|isotoxal]] polyhedron (having equivalent edges) is also isotoxal.\n\nDuality is closely related to ''reciprocity'' or ''polarity'', a geometric transformation that, when applied to a convex polyhedron, realizes the dual polyhedron as another convex polyhedron.\n\n==Kinds of duality==\n[[File:Ioanniskepplerih00kepl 0271 crop.jpg|thumb|400px|The dual of a [[Platonic solid]] can be constructed by connecting the face centers. In general this creates only a [[#Topological duality|topological dual]].<br>Images from [[Kepler]]'s [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619)]]\n\nThere are many kinds of duality. The kinds most relevant to elementary polyhedra are polar reciprocity and topological or abstract duality.\n\n===Polar reciprocation===\n{{See also|Polar reciprocation}}\n\nThe duality of polyhedra is often defined in terms of [[polar reciprocation]] about a concentric sphere. Here, each vertex (pole) is associated with a face plane (polar plane or just polar) so that the ray from the center to the vertex is perpendicular to the plane, and the product of the distances from the center to each is equal to the square of the radius.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cundy|Rollett|1961}}, 3.2 Duality, pp.&nbsp;78\u201379; {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, Pages 3-5. (Note, Wenninger's discussion includes nonconvex polyhedra.)</ref> In coordinates, for reciprocation about the sphere\n\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2,</math>\n\nthe vertex\n\n:<math>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</math>\n\nis associated with the plane\n\n:<math>x_0x + y_0y + z_0z = r^2</math>.\n\nThe vertices of the dual are the poles reciprocal to the face planes of the original, and the faces of the dual lie in the polars reciprocal to the vertices of the original. Also, any two adjacent vertices define an edge, and these will reciprocate to two adjacent faces which intersect to define an edge of the dual. This dual pair of edges are always orthogonal (at right angles) to each other.\n\nIf <math>r_0</math> is the radius of the sphere, and <math>r_1</math> and <math>r_2</math> respectively the distances from its centre to the pole and its polar, then:\n\n:<math>r_1 . r_2 = r_0^2</math>\n\nFor the more symmetrical polyhedra having an obvious centroid, it is common to make the polyhedron and sphere concentric, as in the Dorman Luke construction described below.\n\nHowever, it is possible to reciprocate a polyhedron about any sphere, and the resulting form of the dual will depend on the size and position of the sphere; as the sphere is varied, so too is the dual form. The choice of center for the sphere is sufficient to define the dual up to similarity. If multiple symmetry axes are present, they will necessarily intersect at a single point, and this is usually taken to be the centroid.  Failing that, a circumscribed sphere, inscribed sphere, or midsphere (one with all edges as tangents) is commonly used.\n\nIf a polyhedron in [[Euclidean space]] has an element passing through the center of the sphere, the corresponding element of its dual will go to infinity. Since Euclidean space never reaches infinity, the projective equivalent, called extended Euclidean space, may be formed by adding the required 'plane at infinity'. Some theorists prefer to stick to Euclidean space and say that there is no dual. Meanwhile, {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}} found a way to represent these infinite duals, in a manner suitable for making  models (of some finite portion!).\n\nThe concept of ''duality'' here is closely related to the [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] in [[projective geometry]], where lines and edges are interchanged. Projective polarity works well enough for convex polyhedra. But for non-convex figures such as star polyhedra, when we seek to rigorously define this form of polyhedral duality in terms of projective polarity, various problems appear.<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|Shephard|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Gailiunas|Sharp|2005}}. {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}} also discusses some issues on the way to deriving his infinite duals.</ref> \nBecause of the definitional issues for geometric duality of non-convex polyhedra, {{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|2007}} argues that any proper definition of a non-convex polyhedron should include a notion of a dual polyhedron.\n\n====Canonical duals====\n[[File:Dual compound 6-8 max.png|thumb|Canonical dual [[Polytope compound#Dual compounds|Compound]] of the cuboctahedron (light) and rhombic dodecahedron (dark). Pairs of edges meet on their common [[intersphere]].]]\n\nAny convex polyhedron can be distorted into a [[canonical polyhedron|canonical form]], in which a unit [[midsphere]] (or intersphere) exists tangent to every edge, and such that the average position of the points of tangency is the center of the sphere. This form is unique up to congruences.\n\nIf we reciprocate such a canonical polyhedron about its midsphere, the dual polyhedron will share the same edge-tangency points and so must also be canonical. It is the canonical dual, and the two together form a canonical dual pair.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|2007}}, Theorem 3.1, p.&nbsp;449.</ref>\n\n===Topological duality===\nEven when a pair of polyhedra cannot be obtained by reciprocation from each other, they may be called duals of each other as long as the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other, and the edges of one correspond to the edges of the other, in an incidence-preserving way. Such pairs of polyhedra are still topologically or abstractly dual.\n\nThe vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron form a [[graph theory|graph]] (the [[n-skeleton|1-skeleton]] of the polyhedron), embedded on a topological sphere, the surface of the polyhedron.\nThe same graph can be projected to form a [[Schlegel diagram]] on a flat plane. The graph formed by the edges and vertices of the dual polyhedron is its [[dual graph]]. More generally, for any polyhedron whose faces form a closed surface, the vertices and edges of the polyhedron form a graph embedded on this surface, and the vertices and edges of the (abstract) dual polyhedron form the dual graph.\n\nAn [[Abstract polytope|abstract polyhedron]] is a certain kind of [[partially ordered set]] (poset) of elements, such that adjacencies, or connections, between elements of the set correspond to adjacencies between elements (faces, edges, etc.) of a polyhedron. Every such poset has a dual poset, formed by reversing all of the order relations. If the poset is visualized as a [[Hasse diagram]], the dual poset may be visualized simply by turning the Hasse diagram upside down.\nEvery geometric polyhedron corresponds to an abstract polyhedron in this way, and has an abstract dual polyhedron. However, for some types of non-convex geometric polyhedron, the dual polyhedron may not be realized geometrically.\n\n==Dorman Luke construction==\nFor a [[uniform polyhedron]], the face of the dual polyhedron may be found from the original polyhedron's [[vertex figure]] using the '''Dorman Luke''' construction.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cundy|Rollett|1961}}, p.&nbsp; 117; {{harvtxt|Wenninger|1983}}, p.&nbsp;30.</ref>\n\nAs an example, the illustration below shows the vertex figure (red) of the [[cuboctahedron]] being used to derive a face (blue) of the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].\n\n[[Image:DormanLuke.svg]]\n\nBefore beginning the construction, the [[vertex figure]] ''ABCD'' is obtained by cutting each connected edge at (in this case) its midpoint.\n\nDorman Luke's construction then proceeds:\n\n:#Draw the vertex figure ''ABCD''\n:#Draw the circumcircle (tangent to every corner ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'').\n:#Draw lines tangent to the circumcircle at each corner ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D''.\n:#Mark the points ''E'', ''F'', ''G'', ''H'', where each tangent line meets the adjacent tangent.\n:#The polygon ''EFGH'' is a face of the dual polyhedron.\n\nIn this example the size of the vertex figure was chosen so that its circumcircle lies on the [[intersphere]] of the cuboctahedron, which also becomes the intersphere of the dual rhombic dodecahedron.\n\nDorman Luke's construction can only be used where a polyhedron has such an intersphere and the vertex figure is cyclic. For instance, it can be applied to the [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]].\n\n==Self-dual polyhedra==\nTopologically, a self-dual polyhedron is one whose dual has exactly the same connectivity between vertices, edges and faces. Abstractly, they have the same Hasse diagram.\n \nA geometrically '''self-dual polyhedron''' is not only topologically self-dual, but its polar reciprocal about a certain point, typically its centroid, is a similar figure. For example, the dual of a regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron, [[reflection through the origin|reflected through the origin]].\n\nEvery polygon is topologically self-dual (it has the same number of vertices as edges, and these are switched by duality), but will not in general be geometrically self-dual (up to rigid motion, for instance). Every polygon has a [[regular polygon|regular form]] which is geometrically self-dual about its intersphere: all angles are congruent, as are all edges, so under duality these congruences swap.\n\nSimilarly, every topologically self-dual convex polyhedron can be realized by an equivalent geometrically self-dual polyhedron, its [[canonical polyhedron]], reciprocal about the center of the [[midsphere]].\n\nThere are infinitely many geometrically self-dual polyhedra. The simplest infinite family are the canonical [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]] of ''n'' sides. Another infinite family, [[elongated pyramid]]s, consists of polyhedra that can be roughly described as a pyramid sitting on top of a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] (with the same number of sides). Adding a frustum (pyramid with the top cut off) below the prism generates another infinite family, and so on.\n\nThere are many other convex, self-dual polyhedra. For example, there are 6 different ones with 7 vertices, and 16 with 8 vertices.<ref>3D [[Java (programming language)|Java]] models at [http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/SymmetricSelfDuals.html Symmetries of Canonical Self-Dual Polyhedra], based on paper by Gunnar Brinkmann, Brendan D.

The regular compound of two [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], known as the [[Stella octangula]], is the only regular compound with this property.\n\n==Dual polytopes and tessellations==\nDuality can be generalized to ''n''-dimensional space and '''dual [[polytope]]s;''' in two dimension these are called [[dual polygon]]s.\n\nThe vertices of one polytope correspond to the (''n'' &minus; 1)-dimensional elements, or facets, of the other, and the ''j'' points that define a (''j'' &minus; 1)-dimensional element will correspond to ''j'' hyperplanes that intersect to give a (''n'' &minus; ''j'')-dimensional element. The dual of an ''n''-dimensional tessellation or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] can be defined similarly.\n\nIn general, the facets of a polytope's dual will be the topological duals of the polytope's vertex figures. For the polar reciprocals of the [[regular polytope|regular]] and [[Uniform polytope|uniform]] polytopes, the dual facets will be polar reciprocals of the original's vertex figure. For example, in four dimensions, the vertex figure of the [[600-cell]] is the [[Regular icosahedron|icosahedron]];  the dual of the 600-cell is the [[120-cell]], whose facets are [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]], which are the dual of the icosahedron.\n\n===Self-dual polytopes and tessellations===\n[[File:Kah 4 4.png|thumb|The [[square tiling]], {4,4}, is self-dual, as shown by these red and blue tilings]]\n[[File:Infinite-order apeirogonal tiling and dual.png|thumb|The [[Infinite-order apeirogonal tiling]], {&infin;,&infin;} in red, and its dual position in blue]]\nThe primary class of self-dual polytopes are [[regular polytope]]s with [[palindromic]] [[Schl\u00e4fli symbol]]s.

The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a [[viol]]), rather than fifths, with strings [[standard tuning|usually tuned]] to [[scientific pitch notation|E<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>]]. \n\nThe instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the [[viol]] or the [[violin family]]. However the body shape especially where it curves into the neck matches the viol family whereas in the rest of the violin family, the body meets the neck with no blending curve.\n\nThe double bass is played with a bow (arco) or by plucking the strings ([[pizzicato]]). In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. Classical music uses the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, as does [[traditional bluegrass]]. In jazz, blues, and related genres, the bass is frequently [[bass amplifier|amplified]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ellen Andrea Wang Sentralen Oslo Jazzfestival (181320).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ellen Andrea Wang performing at the Oslo Jazz Festival.]]\nThe double bass stands around {{convert|180|cm|ft|0|abbr=in}} from scroll to endpin.<ref name=\"size\">[http://www.gollihurmusic.com/faq/2-SIZES_DOUBLE_BASS_SIZING_FAQ.html ''Double Bass Sizing FAQ''], Bob Gollihur</ref> However, other sizes are available, such as a {{1/2}} or {{3/4}}, which serve to accommodate a player's height and hand size.

It is uncertain whether the instrument is a descendant of the [[viola da gamba]] or of the violin, but it is traditionally aligned with the violin family. While the double bass is nearly identical in construction to other violin family instruments, it also embodies features found in the older [[viol]] family.\n\n==Playing style==\nLike other violin and viol-family string instruments, the double bass is played either with a [[String instrument#Bowing|bow (arco)]] or by plucking the strings ([[pizzicato]]). In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm, except for some solos and also occasional written parts in [[Jazz#1980s\u20132000s|modern jazz]] that call for bowing.\n\nIn classical pedagogy, almost all of the focus is on performing with the bow and producing a good bowed tone; there is little work done on developing significant pizzicato skills. Bowed notes in the lowest register of the instrument produce a dark, heavy, mighty, or even menacing effect, when played with a fortissimo dynamic; however, the same low pitches played with a delicate pianissimo can create a sonorous, mellow accompaniment line. Classical bass students learn all of the different bow articulations used by other [[string section]] players (e.g., [[violin]] and [[cello]]), such as [[d\u00e9tach\u00e9]], [[legato]], [[staccato]], [[sforzando (musical direction)|sforzato]], [[martel\u00e9 (bowstroke)|martel\u00e9]] (\"hammered\"-style), [[sul ponticello]], [[sul tasto]], [[tremolo]], [[spiccato]] and [[sautill\u00e9]]. Some of these articulations can be combined; for example, the combination of sul ponticello and tremolo can produce eerie, ghostly sounds. Classical bass players do play pizzicato parts in orchestra, but these parts generally require simple notes (quarter notes, half notes, whole notes), rather than rapid passages.\n[[File:Ila Auto.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Double bass is the standard bass instrument in bluegrass. The Norwegian band Ila Auto, shown here, shows that the bass can be a head taller than the bassist (Kristoffer Iversen).]]\nClassical players perform both bowed and pizz notes using [[vibrato]], an effect created by rocking or quivering the left hand finger that is contacting the string, which then transfers an undulation in pitch to the tone. Vibrato is used to add expression to string playing. In general, very loud, low-register passages are played with little or no vibrato, as the main goal with low pitches is to provide a clear [[fundamental bass]] for the [[string section]]. Mid- and higher-register melodies are typically played with more vibrato. The speed and intensity of the vibrato is varied by the performer for an emotional and musical effect.\n\nIn [[jazz]], [[rockabilly]] and other related genres, much or all of the focus is on playing pizzicato. In jazz and [[jump blues]], bassists are required to play extremely rapid pizzicato [[walking bass]]lines for extended periods. As well, jazz and rockabilly bassists develop virtuoso pizzicato techniques that enable them to play rapid solos that incorporate fast-moving triplet and sixteenth note figures. Pizzicato basslines performed by leading jazz professionals are much more difficult than the pizzicato basslines that Classical bassists encounter in the standard orchestral literature, which are typically whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, and occasional eighth note passages. In jazz and related styles, bassists often add semi-percussive \"[[ghost note]]s\" into basslines, to add to the rhythmic feel and to add [[fill (music)|fills]] to a bassline.\n\nThe double bass player stands, or sits on a high stool, and leans the instrument against their body, turned slightly inward to put the strings comfortably in reach. This stance is a key reason for the bass's sloped shoulders, which mark it apart from the other members of the violin family\u2014the narrower shoulders facilitate playing the strings in their higher registers.<ref name=\"size\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Violone PeterLely1649DutEng.png|thumb|right|240px|Some early basses were conversions of existing violones. This 1640 painting shows a violone being played.]]\n\nThe double bass is generally regarded as a modern descendant of the string family of instruments that originated in Europe in the 15th century, and as such has been described as a ''bass Violin.''<ref name=\"mania\">[http://www.contrabass.com/pages/stringbass.html ''The Double Bass''], Jacob Head</ref> Before the 20th century many double basses had only three strings, in contrast to the five to six strings typical of instruments in the viol family or the four strings of instruments in the violin family. The double bass's proportions are dissimilar to those of the violin and cello; for example, it is deeper (the distance from front to back is proportionally much greater than the violin). In addition, while the violin has bulging shoulders, most double basses have shoulders carved with a more acute slope, like members of the viol family. Many very old double basses have had their shoulders cut or sloped to aid playing with modern techniques. Before these modifications, the design of their shoulders was closer to instruments of the violin family.\n\nThe double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] (see [[#Tuning|Tuning]] below). The issue of the instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, and the supposition that the double bass is a direct descendant of the [[viol]] family is one that has not been entirely resolved.\n\nIn his ''A New History of the Double Bass'', Paul Brun asserts, with many references, that the double bass has origins as the true bass of the [[violin family]]. He states that, while the exterior of the double bass may resemble the viola da gamba, the internal construction of the double bass is nearly identical to instruments in the [[violin family]], and very different from the internal structure of viols.<ref name=\"new_history\">{{cite web|url=http://paulbrun.com |title=A New History of the Double Bass |publisher=Paulbrun.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDouble bass professor [[Larry Hurst]] argues that the \"modern double bass is not a true member of either the violin or viol families.\" He says that \"most likely its first general shape was that of a violone, the largest member of the viol family. Some of the earliest basses extant are violones, (including C-shaped sound holes) that have been fitted with modern trappings.\"<ref name=\"oocities.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/vienna/1187/Music/basshist.html |title=A Brief History of the Double Bass |publisher=Oocities.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref> Some existing instruments, such as those by [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2]], were converted from 16th-century six-string contrabass [[violone|violoni]].<ref>Planyavsky 1998</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Ron plays.JPG|thumb|20\n0px|left| Jazz bassist [[Ron Carter]] pictured playing with his Quartet at \"Altes Pfandhaus\" in Cologne]] <!-- look at that awesome hand position!!! -->\n\nA person who plays this instrument is called a \"bassist\", \"double bassist\", \"double bass player\", \"contrabassist\", \"contrabass player\" or \"bass player\".

In [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music]], the instrument is also referred to as a \"bass fiddle\" or \"bass violin\" (or more rarely as \"doghouse bass\" or \"bull fiddle\"). The upright bass is different from the [[acoustic bass guitar]], which is a guitar-family instrument that is built like an [[acoustic guitar]] (although the acoustic bass guitar typically has four strings, tuned E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G and a sturdier construction).\n\nThe double bass is sometimes confusingly called the '''[[violone]]''', '''[[bass violin]]''' or '''[[bass viol]]'''. Other colourful nicknames are found in other languages; in Hungarian, the double bass is sometimes called ''nagy b\u0151g\u0151'', which roughly translates as \"big crier\", referring to its large voice. In Brazil, specifically the northeast region, it is also called ''rabec\u00e3o'', meaning \"big [[rabeca]]\". The rabeca (or rabeca chuleira) is a type of [[fiddle]] from northeastern Brazil and northern Portugal used in Brazilian forr\u00f3 music. The rabeca is descended from the medieval [[rebec]].\n\n==Design==\n[[Image:busettosolano.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of a Busetto-shaped double bass: remake of a Matthias Klotz (1700) by Rumano Solano]]\n[[Image:Bassdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Principal parts of the double bass]]\n\nIn general, there are two major approaches to the design outline shape of the double bass: the ''violin form'' (shown in the labelled picture to the right); and the ''viola da gamba'' form (shown in the header picture). A third less common design, called the ''busetto'' shape, can also be found, as can the even more rare ''guitar'' or ''pear'' shape. The back of the instrument can vary from being a round, carved back similar to that of the violin, to a flat and angled back similar to the viol family.\n\nThe double bass features many parts that are similar to members of the violin family, including a wooden, carved [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] to support the strings, two [[f-hole]]s, a [[tailpiece]] into which the ball ends of the strings are inserted (with the tailpiece anchored around the endpin mount), an ornamental [[scroll (music)|scroll]] near the pegbox, a nut with grooves for each string at the junction of the fingerboard and the pegbox and a sturdy, thick [[sound post]], which transmits the vibrations from the top of the instrument to the hollow body and supports the pressure of the string tension. Unlike the rest of the violin family, the double bass still reflects influences from, and can be considered partly derived, from the [[viol]] family of instruments, in particular the [[violone]], the lowest-pitched and largest bass member of the viol family. As with the other violin and viol family instruments that are played with a bow (and unlike mainly plucked or picked instruments like guitar), the double bass's bridge has an arc-like, curved shape. This is done because with bowed instruments, the player must be able to play individual strings. If the double bass were to have a flat bridge, it would be impossible to bow the A and D strings individually.\n\nThe double bass also differs from members of the violin family in that the shoulders are typically sloped and the back is often angled (both to allow easier access to the instrument, particularly in the upper range). [[Machine head|Machine tuners]] are always fitted, in contrast to the rest of the violin family, where traditional wooden friction pegs are still the primary means of tuning. Lack of standardization in design means that one double bass can sound and look very different from another.\n\n===Construction===\nThe double bass is closest in construction to violins, but has some notable similarities to the violone (literally \"large viol\"), the largest and lowest-pitched member of the viol family. Unlike the violone, however, the fingerboard of the double bass is [[fret|unfretted]], and the double bass has fewer strings (the violone, like most viols, generally had six strings, although some specimens had five or four). The fingerboard is made of [[ebony]] on high-quality instruments; on less expensive student instruments, other woods may be used and then painted or stained black (a process called \"ebonizing\"). The fingerboard is radiused using a curve, for the same reason that the bridge is curved: if the fingerboard and bridge were to be flat, then a bassist would not be able to bow the inner two strings individually. By using a curved bridge and a curved fingerboard, the bassist can align the bow with any of the four strings and play them individually. Unlike the violin and viola, but like the cello, the bass fingerboard is somewhat flattened out underneath the E string (the C string on cello). The vast majority of fingerboards cannot be adjusted by the performer; any adjustments must be made by a luthier. A very small number of expensive basses for professionals have adjustable fingerboards, in which a screw mechanism can be used to raise or lower the fingerboard height.\n\nAn important distinction between the double bass and other members of the violin family is the construction of the [[pegbox]] and the tuning mechanism. While the violin, [[viola]], and cello all use friction [[tuning peg|pegs]] for tuning adjustments (tightening and loosening the string tension to raise or lower the string's pitch), the double bass has metal [[machine head]]s and gears. One of the challenges with tuning pegs is that the friction between the wood peg and the peg hole may become insufficient to hold the peg in place, particularly if the peg hole become worn and enlarged. The key on the tuning machine of a double bass turns a metal ''worm'', which drives a [[worm gear]] that winds the string. Turning the key in one direction tightens the string (thus raising its pitch); turning the key the opposite direction reduces the tension on the string (thus lowering its pitch). While this development makes fine tuners on the tailpiece (important for violin, viola and cello players, as their instruments use friction pegs for major pitch adjustments) unnecessary, a very small number of bassists use them nevertheless. One rationale for using fine tuners on bass is that for instruments with the low C extension, the pulley system for the long string may not effectively transfer turns of the key into changes of string tension/pitch. At the base of the double bass is a metal rod with a spiked or rubberized end called the endpin, which rests on the floor. This [[endpin]] is generally thicker and more robust than that of a cello, because of the greater mass of the instrument.\n\nThe materials most often used in double bass construction for fully carved basses (the type used by professional orchestra bassists and soloists) are [[maple]] (back, neck, ribs), [[spruce]] (top), and [[ebony]] (fingerboard, tailpiece). The tailpiece may be made from other types of wood or non-wood materials. Less expensive basses are typically constructed with [[laminate]]d ([[plywood]]) tops, backs, and ribs, or are hybrid models produced with laminated backs and sides and carved solid wood tops. Some 2010-era lower- to mid-priced basses are made of [[willow]], student models constructed of [[Fiberglass]] were produced in the mid-20th century, and some (typically fairly expensive) basses have been constructed of [[Carbon fiber]].\n[[File:Efe cb.jpg|thumb|left|200px|This photo shows the thick soundpost on a double bass (circled in green).]]\nLaminated (plywood) basses, which are widely used in music schools, [[youth orchestra]]s, and in popular and folk music settings (including [[rockabilly]], [[psychobilly]], [[blues]], etc.), are very resistant to humidity and heat, as well to the physical abuse they are apt to encounter in a school environment (or, for blues and folk musicians, to the hazards of touring and performing in bars). Another option is the hybrid body bass, which has a laminated back and a carved or solid wood top. It is less costly and somewhat less fragile (at least regarding its back) than a fully carved bass. In 2015, the least expensive entry-level new, fully carved basses range from $2,750<ref name=\"gollihurmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gollihurmusic.com/category/6-BASSES.html|title=Upright Basses & EUB's, at Gollihur Music - Upright Basses, Pickups, Preamps, Amps, and More|website=www.gollihurmusic.com}}</ref> to $4,950<ref name=\"uptonbass.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uptonbass.com/instruments/ub-standard-double-basses/|title=Introductory Double Bass - UB Standard model Upton Basses|publisher=}}</ref> USD, although a higher-end new carved instrument may cost from $9,000 to $24,000 USD.<ref name=\"lemurmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lemurmusic.com/BASSES/departments/20/|title=Upright Bass, String Bass, Double Bass - www.lemurmusic.com|website=www.lemurmusic.com}}</ref> In 2015, bassists in top professional orchestras may have antique carved instruments valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

New hybrid basses range from $3,000<ref name=\"uptonbass.com\"/> to $6,400<ref name=\"\u201cnewstandardbass.com\"/>  USD.\n\nThe [[soundpost]] and [[bass bar]] are components of the internal construction. All the parts of a double bass are glued together, except the soundpost, bridge, and tailpiece, which are held in place by string tension (although the soundpost usually remains in place when the instrument's strings are loosened or removed, as long as the bass is kept on its back. Some luthiers recommend changing only one string at a time to reduce the risk of the soundpost falling). If the soundpost falls, a luthier is needed to put the soundpost back into position, as this must be done with tools inserted into the f-holes; moreover, the exact placement of the soundpost under the bridge is essential for the instrument to sound its best. Basic bridges are carved from a single piece of wood, which is customized to match the shape of the top of each instrument. The least expensive bridges on student instruments may be customized just by sanding the feet to match the shape of the instrument's top. A bridge on a professional bassist's instrument may be ornately carved by a luthier.\n\nProfessional bassists are more likely to have adjustable bridges, which have a metal screw mechanism. This enables the bassist to raise or lower the height of the strings to accommodate changing humidity or temperature conditions.  The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While tuning mechanisms generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental [[tuning peg]]s projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.\n\nFamous double bass makers come from around the world and often represent varied national characteristics. The most highly sought (and expensive) instruments come from Italy and include basses made by [[Giovanni Paolo Maggini]], [[Gaspar da Sal\u00f2]], the [[Testore]] family (Carlo Antonio, Carlo Giuseppe, Gennaro, Giovanni, Paulo Antonio), [[Celestino Puolotti]], and [[Matteo Gofriller]]. French and English basses from famous makers are also sought out by players.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Travel instruments====\nAs of 2016, several manufacturers make travel instruments, which are double basses that have features which reduce the size of the instrument so that the instrument will meet airline travel requirements. Travel basses are designed for touring musicians. One type of travel bass has a much smaller body than normal, while still retaining all of the features needed for playing. While these smaller-body instruments appear similar to [[electric upright bass]]es, the difference is that small-body travel basses still have a fairly large hollow acoustic sound chamber, while many EUBs are solid body, or only have a small hollow chamber. A second type of travel bass has a hinged or removable neck and a regular sized body. The hinged or removable neck makes the instrument smaller when it is packed for transportation.\n\n===Strings===\n[[Image:Bridgedetail.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Detail of the bridge and strings]]\n[[Image:Double bass gut strings.jpg|thumb|upright|Gut strings]]\nThe history of the double bass is tightly coupled to the development of string technology, as it was the advent<ref name=\"briefhistoryofthedoublebass\"/> of [[Strings (music)#Winding|overwound]] gut strings, which first rendered the instrument more generally practicable, as (over{{nbhyph}}) wound strings attain low notes within a smaller overall string diameter than non-wound strings.<ref>[http://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html#music Strings, standing waves and harmonics], Prof. Joe Wolfe, University of New South Wales</ref> Professor [[Larry Hurst]] argues that had \"it not been for the appearance of the overwound gut string in the 1650s, the double bass would surely have become extinct.\"<ref name=\"oocities.org\"/> because thicknesses needed for regular gut strings made the lower-pitched strings almost unplayable and hindered the development of fluid, rapid playing in the lower register.\n\nPrior to the mid-20th century,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} double bass strings were usually made of [[Catgut]], (which despite its name is made from sheep intestine, not cats) but, since that time, steel has largely replaced it, because steel strings hold their pitch better and yield more volume when played with the bow.<ref name=\"bow_wood\">[http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44 Article on bass strings by the Double Bass Workshop] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325185214/http://doublebassworkshop.com/double-bass-strings-articles-44 |date=25 March 2012 }}</ref> Gut strings are also more vulnerable to changes of humidity and temperature, and break more easily than steel strings.\n\nGut strings are nowadays mostly used by bassists who perform in [[Baroque music|baroque]] ensembles, [[rockabilly]] bands, traditional [[blues]] bands, and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands. In some cases, the low E and A are wound in silver, to give them added mass. Gut strings provide the dark, \"thumpy\" sound heard on 1940s and 1950s recordings. The late Jeff Sarli, a blues upright bassist, said that, \"Starting in the 1950s, they began to reset the necks on basses for steel strings.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffsarli.com/js/default.asp |title=Jeff Sarli |publisher=Jeff Sarli |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> Rockabilly and bluegrass bassists also prefer gut because it is much easier to perform the \"[[Slapping (music)|slapping]]\" upright bass style (in which the strings are percussively slapped and clicked against the fingerboard) with gut strings than with steel strings, because gut does not hurt the plucking fingers as much. A less expensive alternative to gut strings is nylon strings; the higher strings are pure nylon, and the lower strings are nylon wrapped in wire, to add more mass to the string, slowing the vibration, and thus facilitating lower pitches. (For more information on slapping, see the sections below on [[#Modern playing styles|Modern playing styles]], [[#Double bass in bluegrass music|Double bass in bluegrass music]], [[#Double bass in jazz|Double bass in jazz]], and [[#Double bass in popular music|Double bass in popular music]]).\n\nThe change from gut to steel has also affected the instrument's playing technique over the last hundred years. Steel strings can be set up closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in higher positions on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century [[Franz Simandl]] method does not use the low E string in higher positions because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these higher positions. However, with modern steel strings, bassists can play with clear tone in higher positions on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension steel strings. For information on the strings used in regular and solo tuning (F{{music|#}}-B-E-A) and with different types of basses (e.g., four-string and five-string), see the [[#Tuning|section below on tuning]].\n\n===Bows===\nThe double bass [[bow (music)|bow]] comes in two distinct forms (shown below). The \"French\" or \"overhand\" bow is similar in shape and implementation to the bow used on the other members of the orchestral string instrument family, while the \"German\" or \"Butler\" bow is typically broader and shorter, and is held in a \"hand shake\" (or \"hacksaw\") position.\n[[Image:French and german bows.jpg|thumb|French (upper) and German bows compared]]\nThese two bows provide different ways of moving the arm and distributing force and weight on the strings. Proponents of the French bow argue that it is more maneuverable, due to the angle at which the player holds the bow. Advocates of the German bow claim that it allows the player to apply more arm weight on the strings. The differences between the two, however, are minute for a proficient player, and modern players in major orchestras use both bows.\n\n====German bow====\n[[Image:German bow2.jpg|left|thumb|German-style bow]]\nThe German bow (sometimes called the Butler bow) is the older of the two designs. The design of the bow and the manner of holding it descend from the older viol instrument family. With older viols, before [[Bow (music)|frogs]] had screw threads to tighten the bow, players held the bow with two fingers between the stick and the hair to maintain tension of the hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicolog.com/violadagamba.asp |title=Viola da Gamba |publisher=musicolog.com |date= |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> Proponents of the use of German bow claim that the German bow is easier to use for heavy strokes that require a lot of power.\n\nCompared to the French bow, the German bow has a taller frog, and the player holds it with the palm angled upwards, as with the upright members of the [[viol]] family. When held in the traditionally correct manner, the thumb applies the necessary power to generate the desired sound. The index finger meets the bow at the point where the frog meets the stick. The index finger also applies an upward torque to the frog when tilting the bow. The little finger (or \"pinky\") supports the frog from underneath, while the ring finger and middle finger rest in the space between the hair and the shaft.\n\n====French bow====\n\n[[Image:French bow2.jpg|right|thumb|French-style bow]]\nThe French bow was not widely popular until its adoption by 19th-century virtuoso [[Giovanni Bottesini]]. This style is more similar to the traditional bows of the smaller string family instruments. It is held as if the hand is resting by the side of the performer with the palm facing toward the bass. The thumb rests on the shaft of the bow, next to the frog while the other fingers drape on the other side of the bow. Various styles dictate the curve of the fingers and thumb, as do the style of piece; a more pronounced curve and lighter hold on the bow is used for virtuoso or more delicate pieces, while a flatter curve and sturdier grip on the bow sacrifices some power for easier control in strokes such as detach\u00e9, spiccato, and staccato.\n[[Image:AGK bass bow grip.jpg|thumb|A bassist holding a French bow; note how the thumb rests on the shaft of the bow next to the frog.]]\n\n====Bow construction and materials====\nDouble bass bows vary in length, ranging from {{convert|60|to(-)|75|cm|in|abbr=on}}. In general, a bass bow is shorter and heavier than a cello bow. [[Brazilwood|Pernambuco]], also known as Brazilwood, is regarded as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used. Inexpensive student bows may be constructed of solid [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], which makes the bow much lighter than a wooden bow (even too light to produce a good tone, in some cases). Student bows may also be made of the less valuable varieties of brazilwood. [[Snakewood]] and [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] are also used in bows of a variety of different qualities. The frog of the double bass bow is usually made out of [[ebony]], although snakewood and [[Bovinae|buffalo]] horn are used by some [[:wiktionary:luthier|luthiers]]. The [[frog (music)|frog]] is movable, as it can be tightened or loosened with a knob (like all violin family bows). The bow is loosened at the end of a practice session or performance. The bow is tightened before playing, until it reaches a tautness that is preferred by the player. The frog on a quality bow is decorated with [[mother of pearl]] inlay.\n\nBows have a leather wrapping on the wooden part of the bow near the frog. Along with the leather wrapping, there is also a wire wrapping, made of [[gold]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} or [[silver]] in quality bows. The hair is usually [[horsehair]]. Part of the regular maintenance of a bow is having the bow \"rehaired\" by a [[luthier]] with fresh horsehair and having the leather and wire wrapping replaced. The double bass bow is strung with either white or black horsehair, or a combination of the two (known as \"salt and pepper\"), as opposed to the customary white horsehair used on the bows of other string instruments. Some bassists argue that the slightly rougher black hair \"grabs\" the heavier, lower strings better.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As well, some bassists and luthiers believe that it is easier to produce a smoother sound with the white variety. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Red hair (chestnut) is also used by some bassists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Some of the lowest-quality, lowest cost student bows are made with synthetic hair. Synthetic hair does not have the tiny \"barbs\" that real horsehair has, so it does not \"grip\" the string well or take rosin well.\n\n====Rosin====\n[[File:Rosins.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A variety of rosin types.]]\nString players apply [[rosin]] to the bow hair so it \"grips\" the string and makes it vibrate. Double bass rosin is generally softer and stickier than violin rosin to allow the hair to grab the thicker strings better, but players use a wide variety of rosins that vary from quite hard (like violin rosin) to quite soft, depending on the weather, the humidity, and the preference of the player. The amount used generally depends on the type of music being performed as well as the personal preferences of the player. Bassists may apply more rosin in works for large orchestra (e.g., Brahms symphonies) than for delicate chamber works.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Some brands of rosin, such as Wiedoeft or Pop's double bass rosin, are softer and more prone to melting in hot weather. Other brands, such as Carlsson or Nyman Harts double bass rosin, are harder and less prone to melting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Pitch==\n[[Image:Bass clef.svg|upright|thumb|The bass (or F) clef is used for most orchestral double bass music.]]\nThe lowest note of a double bass is an E<sub>1</sub> (on standard four-string basses) at approximately 41&nbsp;Hz or a C<sub>1</sub> (\u224833&nbsp;Hz), or sometimes B<sub>0</sub> (\u224831&nbsp;Hz), when five strings are used. This is within about an octave above the [[hearing range|lowest frequency]] that the average human ear can perceive as a distinctive pitch. The top of the instrument's fingerboard range is typically near D<sub>5</sub>, two octaves and a fifth above the open pitch of the G string (G<sub>2</sub>), as shown in the range illustration found at the head of this article. Playing beyond the end of the fingerboard can be accomplished by pulling the string slightly to the side.\n\nDouble bass symphony parts sometimes indicate that the performer should play [[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|harmonics]] (also called [[flageolet tone]]s), in which the bassist lightly touches the string\u2013without pressing it onto the fingerboard in the usual fashion\u2013in the location of a note and then plucks or bows the note. Bowed harmonics are used in contemporary music for their \"glassy\" sound. Both natural [[harmonics]] and [[artificial harmonic]]s, where the thumb stops the note and the octave or other harmonic is activated by lightly touching the string at the relative node point, extend the instrument's range considerably. Natural and artificial harmonics are used in plenty of virtuoso concertos for the double bass.\n\nOrchestral parts from the standard [[classical music|Classical repertoire]] rarely demand the double bass exceed a two-octave and a minor third range, from E<sub>1</sub> to G<sub>3</sub>, with occasional A<sub>3</sub>s appearing in the standard repertoire (an exception to this rule is Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', which calls for three octaves and a perfect fourth). The upper limit of this range is extended a great deal for 20th- and 21st-century orchestral parts (e.g., [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 Suite]]'' ({{circa}}1933) bass solo, which calls for notes as high as D<sub>4</sub> and E{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>). The upper range a [[virtuoso]] solo player can achieve using natural and artificial harmonics is hard to define, as it depends on the skill of the particular player. The high harmonic in the range illustration found at the head of this article may be taken as representative rather than normative.\n\nFive-string instruments have an additional string, typically tuned to a low B below the E string (B<sub>0</sub>). On rare occasions, a higher string is added instead, tuned to the C above the G string (C<sub>3</sub>). Four-string instruments may feature the [[Double bass#C extension|C extension]] extending the range of the E string downwards to C<sub>1</sub> (sometimes B<sub>0</sub>).\n\nTraditionally, the double bass is a [[transposing instrument]]. Since much of the double bass's range lies below the standard [[bass clef]], it is notated an octave higher than it sounds to avoid having to use excessive ledger lines below the staff. Thus, when double bass players and cellists are playing from a combined bass-cello part, as used in many Mozart and Haydn symphonies, they will play in octaves, with the basses one octave below the cellos. This transposition applies even when bass players are reading the [[tenor clef|tenor]] and [[treble clef]] (which are used in solo playing and some orchestral parts). The tenor clef is also used by composers for cello and low brass parts. The use of tenor or treble clef avoids excessive ledger lines above the staff when notating the instrument's upper range. Other notation traditions exist. Italian solo music is typically written at the sounding pitch, and the \"old\" German method sounded an octave below where notation except in the treble clef, where the music was written at pitch.\n\n==Tuning==\n\n===Regular tuning===\n[[File:(Portrait of Teddy Kaye, Vivien Garry, and Arv(in) Charles Garrison, Dixon's, New York, N.Y., ca. May 1947) (LOC) (4976467461).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Double bass player [[Vivien Garry]] playing a show in New York City in 1947.]]\nThe double bass is generally tuned in [[Perfect fourth|fourths]], in contrast to other members of the [[Violin family|orchestral string family]], which are tuned in [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] (for example, the violin's four strings are, from lowest-pitched to highest-pitched: G-D-A-E). The standard tuning (lowest-pitched to highest-pitched) for bass is E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G, starting from E below second low C ([[concert pitch]]). This is the same as the standard tuning of a bass guitar and is one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of [[guitar|standard guitar tuning]]. Prior to the 19th-century, many double basses had only three strings; \"Giovanni Bottesini (1821\u20131889) favored the three-stringed instrument popular in Italy at the time\",<ref name=\"oocities.org\"/> because \"the three-stringed instrument [was viewed as] being more sonorous.\"<ref>\"Double bass.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. 1911 Edition [en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica/Double_bass]</ref> Many [[cobla]] bands in [[Catalonia]] still have players using traditional three-string double basses tuned A\u2013D\u2013G.<ref>[http://www.coblabaixllobregat.com/Contrabaix.htm Three-string double bass in the cobla band] Website of Cobla Baix Llobregat</ref>\n<!-- Check out the photo of Bottesini below...he clearly has only 3 strings! -->\n\nThroughout [[Classical music|classical]] repertoire, there are notes that fall below the range of a standard double bass. Notes below low E appear regularly in the double bass parts found in later arrangements and interpretations of [[Baroque music]]. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era, the double bass typically doubled the cello part an octave below, occasionally requiring descent to C below the E of the four-string double bass. In the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era and the 20th century, composers such as [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] also requested notes below the low E.\n\nThere are several methods for making these notes available to the player. Players with standard double basses (E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G) may play the notes below \"E\" an octave higher or if this sounds awkward, the entire passage may be transposed up an octave. The player may tune the low E string down to the lowest note required in the piece: D or C. Four-string basses may be fitted with a \"low-C extension\" ([[Double bass#C extension|see below]]). Or the player may employ a five-string instrument, with the additional lower string tuned to C, or (more commonly in modern times) B, three [[octave]]s and a [[semitone]] below [[middle C]]. Several major European orchestras use basses with a fifth string.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billbentgen.com/bass/5_string-basses.htm |title=Bill Bentgen \u2013 5 String Basses |publisher=Billbentgen.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===C extension===\n[[Image:Double bass C extension.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A low-C extension with wooden mechanical \"fingers\" that stop the string at C{{music|#}}, D, E{{music|b}}, or E. For orchestral passages which only go down to a low E, the \"finger\" at the nut is usually closed.]]\nIn Britain, the USA and Canada, most professional orchestral players use four-string double basses with a ''C extension''. This is an extra section of fingerboard mounted on the head of the bass. It extends the fingerboard under the lowest string and gives an additional four semitones of downward range. The lowest string is typically tuned down to C<sub>1</sub>, an octave below the lowest note on the cello. More rarely this string may be tuned to a low B<sub>0</sub>, as a few works in the orchestral repertoire call for such a B, such as [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]]'s ''The Pines of Rome''. In rare cases, some players have a low B extension, which has B as its lowest note. There are several varieties of extensions:\n\nIn the simplest mechanical extensions, there are no mechanical aids attached to the fingerboard extension except a locking nut or \"gate\" for the E note. To play the extension notes, the player reaches back over the area under the scroll to press the string to the fingerboard. The advantage of this \"fingered\" extension is that the player can adjust the intonation of all of the [[stopped note]]s on the extension, and there are no mechanical noises from metal keys and levers. The disadvantage of the \"fingered\" extension is that it can be hard to perform rapid alternations between low notes on the extension and notes on the regular fingerboard, such as a bassline that quickly alternates between G and D.\n\nThe simplest type of mechanical aid is the use of wooden \"fingers\" or \"gates\" that can be closed to press the string down and fret the C{{music|#}}, D, E{{music|b}}, or E notes. This system is particularly useful for basslines that have a repeating [[pedal point]] such as a low D because once the note is locked in place with the mechanical finger the lowest string sounds a different note when played open (e.g., a low D).\n\nThe most complicated mechanical aid for use with extensions is the mechanical lever system nicknamed the ''machine''. This lever system, which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, mounts levers beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the E-string side), which remotely activate metal \"fingers\" on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal lever systems also give the player the ability to \"lock\" down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden \"finger\" system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.\n\nOnce a mechanical \"finger\" of the wooden \"finger\" extension or the metal \"finger\" machine extension is locked down or depressed, it is not easy to make microtonal pitch adjustments or [[glissando]] effects, as is possible with a hand-fingered extension.\n\nWhile the most common type of extension is the C extension, in rare cases, owners of five-string basses, in which the lowest string is normally a low B, may use either a two semitone extension, providing a low A, or the very rare low G extension.\n\n===Other tuning variations===\nA small number of bass players tune their strings in [[Fifths tuning|fifths]], like a cello but an octave lower (C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A low to high). This tuning was used by the jazz player [[Red Mitchell]] and is used by some classical players, notably the Canadian bassist [[Joel Quarrington]]. Advocates of tuning the bass in fifths point out that all of the other orchestral strings are tuned in fifths (violin, viola, and cello), so this puts the bass in the same tuning approach. Fifth tuning provides a bassist with a wider range of pitch than a standard E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G bass, as it ranges (without an extension) from C<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>2</sub>. Some players who use fifths tuning who play a five-string bass use an additional high string (thus, from lowest to highest: C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E). Some fifth tuning bassists who only have a four string instrument and who are mainly performing soloistic works use the G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E tuning, thus omitting the low C string but gaining a high E. Some fifth tuning bassists who use a five-string use a smaller scale instrument, thus making fingering somewhat easier. The Berlioz\u2013Strauss [[Treatise on Instrumentation]] (first published in 1844) states that \"A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them tuned in fifths and thirds.\" The book then shows a tuning of (E\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A) from bottom to top string. \"Together with the other double-basses tuned in fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra.\"\n\nIn classical solo playing the double bass is usually tuned a whole tone higher (F{{music|#}}\u2013B\u2013E\u2013A). This higher tuning is called \"solo tuning\", whereas the regular tuning is known as \"orchestral tuning\". Solo tuning strings are generally thinner than regular strings. String tension differs so much between solo and orchestral tuning that a different set of strings is often employed that has a lighter gauge. Strings are always labelled for either solo or orchestral tuning and published solo music is arranged for either solo or orchestral tuning. Some popular solos and concerti, such as the ''[[Koussevitsky Concerto]]'' are available in both solo and orchestral tuning arrangements. Solo tuning strings can be tuned down a tone to play in orchestra pitch, but the strings often lack projection in orchestral tuning and their pitch may be unstable.\n\nSome contemporary composers specify highly specialized [[scordatura]] (intentionally changing the tuning of the open strings). Changing the pitch of the open strings makes different notes available as [[pedal point]]s and harmonics.\n[[Luciano Berio|Berio]], for example, asks the player to tune their strings E\u2013G{{music|#}}\u2013D\u2013G in ''Sequenza XIVb'' and [[Giacinto Scelsi|Scelsi]] asks for both F\u2013A\u2013D\u2013E and F\u2013A\u2013F\u2013E in ''Nuits''. A variant and much less-commonly used form of solo tuning used in some Eastern European countries is (A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C), which uses three of the strings from orchestral tuning (A\u2013D\u2013G) and then adds a high \"C\" string. Some bassists with five-string basses use a high \"C\" string as the fifth string, instead of a low \"B\" string. Adding the high \"C\" string facilitates the performance of solo repertoire with a high tessitura (range). Another option is to utilize both a low C (or B) extension and a high C string.\n\n====Five strings====\nWhen choosing a bass with a fifth string, the player may decide between adding a higher-pitched string (a high C string) or a lower-pitched string (typically a low B). Six-stringed instruments are generally regarded as impractical. To accommodate the additional fifth string, the fingerboard is usually slightly widened, and the top slightly thicker, to handle the increased tension. Some five-stringed instruments are converted four-string instruments. Because these do not have wider fingerboards, some players find them more difficult to finger and bow. Converted four-string basses usually require either a new, thicker top, or lighter strings to compensate for the increased tension.\n\n==Playing and performance considerations==\n\n===Body and hand position===\n[[File:Renaudgarciafons.JPG|thumb|right|200px|French double-bass player and composer [[Renaud Garcia-Fons]] pictured during a performance.]]\nDouble bassists either stand or sit to play the instrument. The instrument height is set by adjusting the endpin such that the player can reach the desired playing zones of the strings with bow or plucking hand. Bassists who stand and bow sometimes set the endpin by aligning the first finger in either first or half position with eye level, although there is little standardization in this regard. Players who sit generally use a stool about the height of the player's pants inseam length.\n\nTraditionally, double bassists stood to play solo and sat to play in the orchestra or opera pit. Now, it is unusual for a player to be equally proficient in both positions, so some soloists sit (as with [[Joel Quarrington]], [[Jeff Bradetich]], Thierry Barb\u00e9, and others) and some orchestral bassists stand.\n\nWhen playing in the instrument's upper range (above G<sub>3</sub>, the G below middle C), the player shifts the hand from behind the neck and flattens it out, using the side of the thumb to press down the string. This technique\u2014also used on the cello\u2014is called ''[[thumb position]]''. While playing in thumb position, few players use the fourth (little) finger, as it is usually too weak to produce reliable tone (this is also true for cellists), although some extreme chords or extended techniques, especially in contemporary music, may require its use.\n\n===Physical considerations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Lucky Dados en Madgarden Festival 2015 - 22.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|The upright bass player of the [[rockabilly]] band Lucky Dados. Rockabilly style can be very demanding on the plucking hand, due to rockabilly's use of \"slapping\" on the fingerboard.]]\nPerforming on bass can be physically demanding, because the strings are large and thick. Also, the space between notes on the fingerboard is large, due to scale length and string spacing, so players must hold their fingers apart for the notes in the lower positions and shift positions frequently to play basslines. As with all non-fretted [[string instrument]]s, performers must learn to place their fingers precisely to produce the correct pitch. For bassists with shorter arms or smaller hands, the large spaces between pitches may present a significant challenge, especially in the lowest range, where the spaces between notes are largest. However, the increased use of playing techniques such as thumb position and modifications to the bass, such as the use of lighter-gauge strings at lower tension, have eased the difficulty of playing the instrument.\n\nBass parts have relatively fewer fast passages, double stops, or large jumps in range. These parts are usually given to the cello section, since the cello is a smaller instrument on which these techniques are more easily performed.\n\nUntil the 1990s, child-sized double basses were not widely available, and the large size of the bass prevented children from playing the instrument until they grew to a height and hand size that allowed them to play a {{3/4}}-size model (the most common size). Starting in the 1990s, smaller {{1/2}}, {{1/4}}, {{frac|8}}, and even {{frac|16}}-sized instruments became more widely available, so children could start younger.\n\n===Volume===\nDespite the size of the instrument, it is not as loud as many other instruments, due to its low range. In a large orchestra, usually between four and eight bassists play in the same [[bassline]] in unison to produce enough volume. In the largest orchestras, bass sections may have as many as ten or twelve players, but modern budget constraints make bass sections this large unusual.\n\nWhen writing solo passages for the bass in orchestral or chamber music, composers typically ensure the [[orchestration]] is light so it does not obscure the bass. While amplification is rarely used in classical music, in some cases where a bass soloist performs a concerto with a full orchestra, subtle amplification called [[acoustic enhancement]] may be used. The use of microphones and amplifiers in a classical setting has led to debate within the classical community, as \"...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/intro2.html |title=Sound Systems- Why?! |publisher=Harada-sound.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Jimbo Wallace.JPG|thumb|[[Psychobilly]] bassist [[Jimbo Wallace]] onstage with [[Reverend Horton Heat]]; note his large [[bass stack]] consisting of a 1x15\" cabinet, a 4x10\" cabinet, and an amplifier \"head\".]]\nIn many genres, such as [[jazz]] and [[blues]], players use amplification via a [[bass instrument amplification|specialized amplifier]] and loudspeakers. A piezoelectric pickup connects to the amplifier with a {{1/4}}-inch patch cable. Bluegrass and jazz players typically use less amplification than blues, [[psychobilly]], or [[jam band]] players. In the latter cases, high overall volume from other amplifiers and instruments may cause unwanted [[audio feedback|acoustic feedback]], a problem exacerbated by the bass's large surface area and interior volume. The feedback problem has led to technological fixes like electronic feedback eliminator devices (essentially an automated [[notch filter]] that identifies and reduces frequencies where feedback occurs) and instruments like the [[electric upright bass]], which has playing characteristics like the double bass but usually little or no soundbox, which makes feedback less likely. Some bassists reduce the problem of feedback by lowering their onstage volume or playing further away from their bass amp speakers.\n\nIn rockabilly and psychobilly, percussively slapping the strings against the fingerboard is an important part of the bass playing style. Since piezoelectric pickups are not good at reproducing the sounds of strings being slapped against the fingerboard, bassists in these genres often use both piezoelectric pickups (for the low bass tone) and a miniature [[condenser mic]] (to pick up the percussive slapping sounds). These two signals are blended together using a simple [[audio mixer|mixer]] before the signal is sent to the bass amp.\n\n===Transportation===\nThe double bass's large size and relative fragility make it cumbersome to handle and transport. Most bassists use soft cases, referred to as [[gig bag]]s, to protect the instrument during transport. These range from inexpensive, thin unpadded cases used by students (which only protect against scratches and rain) to thickly padded versions for professional players, which also protect against bumps and impacts. Some bassists carry their bow in a hard bow case; more expensive bass cases have a large pocket for a bow case. Players also may use a small cart and end pin-attached wheels to move the bass. Some higher-priced padded cases have wheels attached to the case. Another option found in higher-priced padded cases are backpack straps, to make it easier to carry the instrument.\n[[File:Double bass flight cases, CBSO, 2013-06-23.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hard flight cases for double basses.]]\nHard flight cases have cushioned interiors and tough exteriors of [[carbon fiber]], [[graphite]], [[fiberglass]], or [[Kevlar]]. The cost of good hard cases\u2013several thousand US dollars\u2013and the high airline fees for shipping them tend to limit their use to touring professionals.\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Page 451 (A Dictionary of Music and Musicians-Volume 2).jpg|thumb|right|150px|A wooden mute attached to the bass bridge to make the tone darker]]\nDouble bass players use various accessories to help them to perform and rehearse. Three types of [[mute (music)#String|mutes]] are used in orchestral music: a wooden mute that slides onto the bridge, a rubber mute that attaches to the bridge and a wire device with brass weights that fits onto the bridge. The player uses the mute when the Italian instruction ''con sordino'' (\"with mute\") appears in the bass part, and removes it in response to the instruction ''senza sordino'' (\"without mute\"). With the mute on, the tone of the bass is quieter, darker, and more somber. Bowed bass parts with a mute can have a nasal tone. Players use a third type of mute, a heavy rubber practice mute, to practice quietly without disturbing others (e.g., in a hotel room).\n\nA quiver is an accessory for holding the bow. It is often made of leather and it attaches to the bridge and tailpiece with ties or straps. It is used to hold the bow while a player plays pizzicato parts.\n\nA [[wolf tone]] eliminator is used to lessen unwanted sympathetic vibrations in the part of a string between the bridge and the tailpiece which can cause tone problems for certain notes. It is a rubber tube cut down the side that is used with a cylindrical metal sleeve which also has a slot on the side. The metal cylinder has a screw and a nut that fastens the device to the string. Different placements of the cylinder along the string influence or eliminate the frequency at which the wolf tone occurs. It is essentially an [[attenuation|attenuator]] that slightly shifts the natural frequency of the string (and/or instrument body) cutting down on the reverberation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Freiberg |first=Sarah |url=http://www.allthingsstrings.com/Instruments/CARE-MAINTENANCE/How-to-Tame-Annoying-Howling-Wolf-Tones |title=How to Tame Annoying Howling Wolf Tones / CARE & MAINTENANCE / Instruments / All Things Strings |publisher=Allthingsstrings.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref> The wolf tone occurs because the strings below the bridge sometimes resonate at pitches close to notes on the playing part of the string. When the intended note makes the below-the-bridge string vibrate sympathetically, a dissonant \"wolf note\" or \"wolf tone\" can occur. In some cases, the wolf tone is strong enough to cause an audible \"beating\" sound. The wolf tone often occurs with the note G{{music|#}} on the bass.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=H. |last1=D\u00fcnnwald |title=Versuche zur Entstehung des Wolfs bei Violininstrumenten |journal=Acustica |volume=41 |issue=4 |year=1979 |pages=238\u201345 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1610-1928&volume=41&issue=4&spage=238&epage=245}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1913343 |title=The wolf in the cello |year=1973 |last1=Firth |first1=Ian M. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=457}}</ref>\n\nIn orchestra, instruments tune to an A played by the oboist. Due to the multiple octaves between the oboist's tuning A and the open A string on the bass (for example, in an orchestra that tunes to 440&nbsp;Hz, the oboist plays an A at 440&nbsp;Hz and the open A of the bass is 55&nbsp;Hz) it can be difficult to tune the bass by ear during the short period that the oboist plays the tuning note. Violinists, on the other hand, tune their A string to the same frequency as the oboist's tuning note. To ensure the bass is in tune, some bassists use an [[electronic tuner]] that indicates pitch on a small display. Bassists who play in styles that use a [[bass amp]], such as blues, rockabilly, or jazz, may use a [[stompbox]]-format electronic tuner, which mutes the bass pickup during tuning.\n\nA double bass stand is used to hold the instrument in place and raise it a few inches off the ground. A wide variety of stands are available, and there is no one common design.\n\n==Classical repertoire==\n\n===Solo works for double bass===\n\n====1700s====\nThe double bass as a solo instrument enjoyed a period of popularity during the 18th century and many of the most popular composers from that era wrote pieces for the double bass. The double bass, then often referred to as the [[Violone]], used different tunings from region to region. The \"Viennese tuning\" (A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>) was popular, and in some cases a fifth string or even sixth string was added (F<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>2</sub>\u2013A<sub>2</sub>).<ref>David Chapman. \"Historical and Practical Considerations for the Tuning of Double Bass Instruments in Fourths\" \u2013 p.228\u2013229, ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 56, (June 2003), pp. 224\u2013233.</ref> The popularity of the instrument is documented in [[Leopold Mozart]]'s second edition of his Violinschule, where he writes \"One can bring forth difficult passages easier with the five-string violone, and I heard unusually beautiful performances of concertos, trios, solos, etc.\"\n[[File:Domenico Dragonetti.JPG|thumb|The Italian bass virtuoso [[Domenico Dragonetti]] helped to encourage composers to give more difficult parts for his instrument.]]\n\nThe earliest known concerto for double bass was written by [[Joseph Haydn]] {{circa}}1763, and is presumed lost in a fire at the Eisenstadt library. The earliest known existing concertos are by [[Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf]], who composed two concertos for the double bass and a [[Sinfonia concertante|Sinfonia Concertante]] for viola and double bass. Other composers that have written concertos from this period include [[Johann Baptist Wanhal|Johann Baptist Vanhal]], [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister]] (3 concertos), [[Leopold Kozeluch]], [[Anton Zimmermann]], [[Antonio Capuzzi]], [[Wenzel Pichl]] (2 concertos), and [[Johannes Matthias Sperger]] (18 concertos). While many of these names were leading figures to the music public of their time, they are generally unknown by contemporary audiences. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s concert aria, ''[[Per Questa Bella Mano]]'', K.612 for bass, double bass [[obbligato]], and orchestra contains impressive writing for solo double bass of that period. It remains popular among both singers and double bassists today.\n\nThe double bass eventually evolved to fit the needs of orchestras that required lower notes and a louder sound. The leading double bassists from the mid-to-late 18th century, such as Josef K\u00e4mpfer, Friedrich Pischelberger, and Johannes Mathias Sperger employed the \"Viennese\" tuning. Bassist Johann Hindle (1792\u20131862), who composed a concerto for the double bass, pioneered tuning the bass in fourths, which marked a turning point for the double bass and its role in solo works. Bassist [[Domenico Dragonetti]] was a prominent musical figure and an acquaintance of Haydn and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. His playing was known all the way from his homeland Italy to the Tsardom of Russia and he found a prominent place performing in concerts with the [[Philharmonic Society of London]]. Beethoven's friendship with Dragonetti may have inspired him to write difficult, separate parts for the double bass in his symphonies, such as the impressive passages in the third movement of the Fifth Symphony, the second movement of the Seventh Symphony, and last movement of the Ninth Symphony. These parts do not double the cello part.\n\nDragonetti wrote ten concertos for the double bass and many solo works for bass and piano. During [[Rossini]]'s stay in London in the summer of 1824, he composed his Duetto for cello and double bass for Dragonetti and the cellist David Salomons. Dragonetti frequently played on a three string double bass tuned G\u2013D\u2013A from top to bottom. The use of only the top three strings was popular for bass soloists and principal bassists in orchestras in the 19th century, because it reduced the pressure on the wooden top of the bass, which was thought to create a more resonant sound. As well, the low E-strings used during the 19th century were thick cords made of gut, which were difficult to tune and play.\n\n====1800s====\n[[File:BottesiniTestore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The virtuoso nineteenth-century bassist and composer Giovanni Bottesini with his 1716 Carlo Antonio Testore bass.]]\nIn the 19th century, the opera conductor, composer, and bassist [[Giovanni Bottesini]] was considered the \"[[Paganini]] of the double bass\" of his time, a reference to the violin virtuoso and composer. Bottesini's bass [[concerto]]s were written in the popular Italian [[opera]] style of the 19th century, which exploit the double bass in a way that was not seen beforehand. They require virtuosic runs and great leaps to the highest registers of the instrument, even into the realm of natural and [[artificial harmonic]]s. Many 19th century and early 20th century bassists considered these compositions unplayable, but in the 2000s, they are frequently performed. During the same time, a prominent school of bass players in the [[Czech lands|Czech region]] arose, which included [[Franz Simandl]], Theodore Albin Findeisen, Josef Hrabe, [[Ludwig Manoly]], and [[Adolf Mi\u0161ek]]. Simandl and Hrabe were also pedagogues whose method books and studies remain in use in the 2000s.\n\n====1900s\u2013present====\nThe leading figure of the double bass in the early 20th century was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], best known as conductor of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], who popularized the double bass in modern times as a solo instrument. Because of improvements to the double bass with steel strings and better set-ups, the bass is now played at a more advanced level than ever before and more and more composers have written works for the double bass. In the mid-century and in the following decades, many new concerti were written for the double bass, including [[Nikos Skalkottas]]'s Concerto (1942), [[Eduard Tubin]]'s Concerto (1948), [[Lars-Erik Larsson]]'s Concertino (1957), [[Gunther Schuller]]'s Concerto (1962), [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s Concerto (1966) and [[Frank Proto]]'s Concerto No. 1 (1968).\n\nThe ''Solo For Contrabass'' is one of the parts of [[John Cage]]'s ''Concert For Piano And Orchestra'' and can be played as a solo, or with any of the other parts both orchestral and/or piano.  Similarly, his solo contrabass parts for the orchestral work ''Atlas Eclipticalis'' can also be performed as solos.  Cage's indeterminate works such as ''Variations I'', ''Variations II'', ''Fontana Mix'', ''Cartridge Music'' et al. can be arranged for a solo contrabassist.  His work ''26.1.1499 For A String Player'' is often realized by a solo contrabass player, although it can also be played by a violinist, violist, or cellist.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the end of the century [[Gary Karr]] was the leading proponent of the double bass as a solo instrument and was active in commissioning or having hundreds of new works and concerti written especially for him. Karr was given Koussevitzky's famous solo double bass by Olga Koussevitsky and played it in concerts around the world for 40 years before, in turn, giving the instrument to the [[International Society of Bassists]] for talented soloists to use in concert. Another important performer in this period, [[Bertram Turetzky]], commissioned and premiered more than 300 double bass works.\n\n[[Image:Sergei Koussevitsky.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Serge Koussevitzky]] popularized the double bass in modern times as a solo instrument]]\n\nIn the 1970s, 1980 and 1990s, new concerti included [[Nino Rota]]'s ''Divertimento for Double Bass and Orchestra'' (1973), [[Alan Ridout]]'s concerto for double bass and strings (1974), [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]]'s Concerto (1975), [[Frank Proto]]'s Concerto No.&nbsp;2, [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]]'s ''Angel Of Dusk'' (1980), [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s Concerto (1983), [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]]'s Concerto (1985), [[Henry Brant]]'s Ghost Nets (1988) and [[Frank Proto]]'s \"Carmen Fantasy for Double Bass and Orchestra\" (1991) and \"Four Scenes after Picasso\" Concerto No.&nbsp;3 (1997). [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]' lyrical [[Strathclyde Concerto]] No.&nbsp;7, for double bass and orchestra, dates from 1992.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, new concerti include [[Frank Proto]]'s \"Nine Variants on Paganini\" (2002), [[Kalevi Aho]]'s Concerto (2005), [[John Harbison]]'s ''Concerto for Bass Viol'' (2006), [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]]'s Double Concerto for violin, double bass, and orchestra (2007) and [[John Woolrich]]'s ''To the Silver Bow'', for double bass, viola and strings (2014).\n\n[[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re]] wrote an Intermezzo and Tarantella for double bass and piano, Op.&nbsp;9, No.&nbsp;1 and No.&nbsp;2 and a Praeludium and Scherzo for double bass and piano, Op.&nbsp;32 No.&nbsp;1 and No.&nbsp;2. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote a rhythmically challenging Double Bass Sonata in 1949. [[Frank Proto]] wrote his Sonata \"1963\" for Double Bass and Piano. In the Soviet Union, [[Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg]] wrote his Sonata No.&nbsp;1 for double bass solo in 1971. [[Giacinto Scelsi]] wrote two double bass pieces called ''Nuits'' in 1972, and then in 1976, he wrote ''Maknongan'', a piece for any low-voiced instrument, such as double bass, contrabassoon, or tuba. [[Vincent Persichetti]] wrote solo works\u2014which he called \"Parables\"\u2014for many instruments. He wrote Parable XVII for Double Bass, Op.&nbsp;131 in 1974. [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] penned a Sonata for double bass and piano in 1975.  In 1976 American minimalist composer [[Tom Johnson (composer)|Tom Johnson]] wrote \"Failing - a very difficult piece for solo string bass\" in which the player has to perform an extremely virtuosic solo on the bass whilst simultaneously reciting a text which says how very difficult the piece is and how unlikely he or she is to successfully complete the performance without making a mistake.\n\nIn 1977 Dutch-Hungarian composer [[Geza Frid]] wrote a set of variations on The Elephant from [[Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' [[Le Carnaval des Animaux]] for [[scordatura]] Double Bass and string orchestra. In 1987 [[Lowell Liebermann]] wrote his Sonata for Contrabass and Piano Op.&nbsp;24. Fernando Grillo wrote the \"Suite No.&nbsp;1\" for double bass (1983/2005). [[Jacob Druckman]] wrote a piece for solo double bass entitled ''Valentine''. US double bass soloist and composer [[Bertram Turetzky]] (born 1933) has performed and recorded more than 300 pieces written by and for him. He writes chamber music, baroque music, classical, jazz, renaissance music, improvisational music and world music\n\nUS minimalist composer [[Philip Glass]] wrote a prelude focused on the lower register that he scored for timpani and double bass. Italian composer [[Sylvano Bussotti]], whose composing career spans from the 1930s to the first decade of the 21st century, wrote a solo work for bass in 1983 entitled ''Naked Angel Face per contrabbasso''. Fellow Italian composer [[Franco Donatoni]] wrote a piece called ''Lem for contrabbasso'' in the same year. In 1989, French composer [[Pascal Dusapin]] (born 1955) wrote a solo piece called ''In et Out'' for double bass. In 1996, the Sorbonne-trained Lebanese composer [[Karim Haddad]] composed ''Ce qui dort dans l'ombre sacr\u00e9e'' (\"He who sleeps in the sacred shadows\") for Radio France's Presence Festival. [[Renaud Garcia-Fons]] (born 1962) is a French double bass player and composer, notable for drawing on jazz, folk, and Asian music for recordings of his pieces like ''Oriental Bass'' (1997).\n\nTwo significant recent works written for solo bass include, [[Mario Davidovsky]]'s Synchronisms No.11 for double bass and electronic sounds and [[Elliott Carter]]'s Figment III, for solo double bass. The German composer [[Gerhard St\u00e4bler]] wrote ''Co-wie Kobalt'' (1989\u201390), \"...a music for double bass solo and grand orchestra.\" [[Charles Wuorinen]] added several important works to the repertoire, ''Spinoff'' trio for double bass, violin and conga drums, and ''Trio for Bass Instruments'' double bass, tuba and bass trombone, and in 2007 ''Synaxis'' for double bass, horn, oboe and clarinet with timpani and strings. The suite \"Seven Screen Shots\" for double bass and piano (2005) by Ukrainian composer [[Alexander Shchetynsky]] has a solo bass part that includes many unconventional methods of playing. The German composer [[Claus K\u00fchnl]] wrote ''Offene Weite / Open Expanse'' (1998) and ''Nachtschwarzes Meer, ringsum\u2026'' (2005) for double bass and piano.\n\nIn 2004 Italian double bassist and composer [[Stefano Scodanibbio]] made a double bass arrangement of [[Luciano Berio]]'s 2002 solo [[cello]] work ''[[Sequenza]] XIV'' with the new title ''Sequenza XIVb''.\n\n===Chamber music with double bass===\nSince there is no established instrumental ensemble that includes the double bass, its use in chamber music has not been as exhaustive as the literature for ensembles such as the [[string quartet]] or [[piano trio]]. Despite this, there is a substantial number of [http://www.paulnemeth.com/basschamber.htm chamber works] that incorporate the double bass in both small and large ensembles.\n\nThere is a small body of works written for [[piano quintet]] with the instrumentation of piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. The most famous is [[Franz Schubert]]'s Piano Quintet in A major, known as \"The [[Trout Quintet]]\" for its set of variations in the fourth movement of Schubert's ''[[Die Forelle]]''. Other works for this instrumentation written from roughly the same period include those by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]], [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], [[Louise Farrenc]], [[Ferdinand Ries]], [[Franz Limmer]], [[Johann Baptist Cramer]], and [[Hermann Goetz]]. Later composers who wrote chamber works for this quintet include [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Colin Matthews]], [[Jon Deak]], [[Frank Proto]], and [[John Woolrich]]. Slightly larger sextets written for piano, string quartet, and double bass have been written by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Richard Wernick]], and [[Charles Ives]].\n\nIn the genre of string quintets, there are a few works for string quartet with double bass. [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s String Quintet in G major, Op.77 and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s Serenade in G major, K.525 (\"[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]\") are the most popular pieces in this repertoire, along with works by [[Miguel del Aguila]] (''Nostalgica'' for string quartet and bass), [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Luigi Boccherini]] (3 quintets), [[Harold Shapero]], and [[Paul Hindemith]]. Another example is Alistair Hinton's String Quintet (1969\u201377), which also includes a major part for solo soprano; at almost 170 minutes in duration, it is almost certainly the largest such work in the repertoire.\n\nSlightly smaller string works with the double bass include six string sonatas by [[Gioachino Rossini]], for two violins, cello, and double bass written at the age of twelve over the course of three days in 1804. These remain his most famous instrumental works and have also been adapted for wind quartet. [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister]] wrote four String Quartets for Solo Double Bass, Violin, Viola, and Cello in D Major. [[Frank Proto]] has written a Trio for Violin, Viola and Double Bass (1974), 2 Duos for Violin and Double Bass (1967 and 2005), and ''The Games of October'' for Oboe/English Horn and Double Bass (1991).\n\nLarger works that incorporate the double bass include [[Beethoven]]'s Septet in E{{music|flat}} major, Op.&nbsp;20, one of his most famous pieces during his lifetime, which consists of clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and bass. When the clarinetist [[Ferdinand Troyer]] commissioned a work from [[Franz Schubert]] for similar forces, he added one more violin for his Octet in F major, D.803. [[Paul Hindemith]] used the same instrumentation as Schubert for his own Octet. In the realm of even larger works, Mozart included the double bass in addition to 12 wind instruments for his \"[[Gran Partita]]\" Serenade, K.361 and [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f|Martin\u016f]] used the double bass in his [[nonet (music)|nonet]] for wind quintet, violin, viola, cello and double bass.\n\nOther examples of chamber works that use the double bass in mixed ensembles include [[Serge Prokofiev]]'s Quintet in G minor, Op.&nbsp;39 for oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, and double bass; [[Miguel del Aguila]]'s ''Malambo'' for bass flute and piano and for string quartet, bass and bassoon; [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s Concertino for flute/piccolo, viola, and double bass; [[Frank Proto]]'s ''Afro-American Fragments'' for bass clarinet, cello, double bass and narrator and Sextet for clarinet and strings; [[Fred Lerdahl]]'s Waltzes for violin, viola, cello, and double bass; [[Mohammed Fairouz]]'s Litany for double bass and wind quartet; [[Mario Davidovsky]]'s Festino for guitar, viola, cello, and double bass; and [[Iannis Xenakis]]'s Morsima-Amorsima for piano, violin, cello, and double bass. There are also new music ensembles that utilize the double bass such as Time for Three and [[PROJECT Trio]].\n\n===Orchestral passages and solos===\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:1em; max-width:468px\">\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\new Score {\n  #(set-default-paper-size \"b6\")\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c, {\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\time 3/4\n      \\key c \\minor\n      \\clef \"bass_8\"\n      \\omit Staff.ClefModifier\n      \\tempo 4 = 240\n      \\omit Score.MetronomeMark\n\n      \\partial 4 g^\\markup { \\halign #-0.5 \\bold \"Allegro\" }(\\pp | c ees g | c2 ees4 | d2 fis,4) | g2.~ | g2.\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\n<small>The opening of the third movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 is often used as an orchestral excerpt during bass [[audition]]s.</small>\n</div>\nIn the baroque and classical periods, composers typically had the double bass double the cello part in orchestral passages. A notable exception is Haydn, who composed solo passages for the double bass in his Symphonies No.&nbsp;6 ''Le Matin'', No.&nbsp;7 ''Le midi'', No.&nbsp;8 ''Le Soir'', No.&nbsp;31 ''Horn Signal'', and No.&nbsp;45 ''Farewell''\u2014but who otherwise grouped bass and cello parts together. Beethoven paved the way for separate double bass parts, which became more common in the romantic era. The [[scherzo]] and [[Trio (music)|trio]] from [[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] are famous orchestral excerpts, as is the recitative at the beginning of the fourth movement of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]]. In many nineteenth century symphonies and concertos, the typical impact of separate bass and cello parts was that bass parts became simpler and cello parts got the melodic lines and rapid passage work.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}<!--Take for example the Sibelius Karelia Suite...much of the first movement, the double basses play a low Eb [[pedal point]]-->\n\nA double bass section of a modern [[orchestra]] typically uses eight double bassists, usually in [[unison]]. Smaller orchestras may have four double basses, and in exceptional cases, bass sections may have as many as ten members. If some double bassists have low C extensions, and some have regular (low E) basses, those with the low C extensions may play some passages an octave below the regular double basses. Also, some composers write divided (divisi) parts for the basses, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to \"outside\" (nearer the audience) and \"inside\" players. Composers writing divisi parts for bass often write [[perfect interval]]s, such as octaves and fifths, but in some cases use thirds and sixths.\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:1em; max-width:468px\">\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\layout {\n  indent = 0\n}\n\\new Score {\n  #(set-default-paper-size \"b6\")\n  \\new Staff {\n    \\relative c, {\n      \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"cello\"\n      \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #92\n      \\time 4/4\n      \\key d \\major\n      \\clef \"bass_8\"\n      \\omit Staff.ClefModifier\n      \\tempo 2 = 60\n      \\omit Score.MetronomeMark\n\n      \\bar \"\"\n      fis2\\p^\\markup { \\halign #-0.5 \\bold \"Allegro assai\" }( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 |\n      fis2( g4 a) | a4( g fis e) | d2( e4 fis) | e4.( d8) d2\n    }\n  }\n}\n</score>\n\n<small>The basses play the theme from the fourth movement of [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].</small>\n</div>\n\nWhere a composition calls for a solo bass part, the principal bass invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) also determines the bowings, often based on bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal bass may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing bass. The principal bass also leads entrances for the bass section, typically by lifting the bow or plucking hand before the entrance or indicating the entrance with the head, to ensure the section starts together. Major professional orchestras typically have an assistant principal bass player, who plays solos and leads the bass section if the principal is absent.\n\nWhile orchestral bass solos are somewhat rare, there are some notable examples. [[Johannes Brahms]], whose father was a double bass player, wrote many difficult and prominent parts for the double bass in his symphonies. [[Richard Strauss]] assigned the double bass daring parts, and his symphonic poems and operas stretch the instrument to its limits. \"The Elephant\" from [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' is a satirical portrait of the double bass, and American virtuoso [[Gary Karr]] made his televised debut playing \"The Swan\" (originally written for the cello) with the [[New York Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The third movement of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|first symphony]] features a solo for the double bass that quotes the children's song ''Frere Jacques'', transposed into a minor key. [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 (Prokofiev)|Lieutenant Kij\u00e9]] Suite'' features a difficult and very high double bass solo in the \"Romance\" movement. [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]]'' contains a prominent passage for the double bass section.\n\n===Double bass ensembles===\nEnsembles made up entirely of double basses, though relatively rare, also exist, and several composers have written or arranged for such ensembles. Compositions for four double basses exist by [[Gunther Schuller]], [[Jacob Druckman]], [[James Tenney]], [[Claus K\u00fchnl]], Robert Ceely, [http://www.janalm.se/ Jan Alm], Bernhard Alt, Norman Ludwin, [[Frank Proto]], Joseph Lauber, [[Erich Hartmann]], [[Colin Brumby]], Miloslav Gajdos and Theodore Albin Findeisen.

As the music moved into bars and brothels, the upright bass gradually replaced these wind instruments around the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2240678|title = Double bass|date = |accessdate = 2015-09-17|website = Grove Music Online|publisher = Oxford Music Online|last = Siemers|first = Bryan}}</ref> Many early bassists doubled on both the ''brass bass ([[tuba]])'' and ''string bass'', as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played improvised [[Walking bassline|\"walking\" bass lines]]\u2014scale- and arpeggio-based lines that outlined the [[chord progression]].\n\nBecause an unamplified upright bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the ''slap style'', slapping and pulling the strings to produce a rhythmic \"slap\" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and made the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not favor low frequencies.<ref name=\"fotos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.peterunbehauen.de/jazz/jazzfotos.html |title=Historic Jazz Fotos |publisher=Peterunbehauen.de |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> For more about the slap style, see ''Modern playing styles'', below.\n[[File:Minugs 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jazz]] bassist [[Charles Mingus]] was also an influential bandleader and composer whose musical interests spanned from bebop to free jazz.]]\n\nJazz bass players are expected to improvise an accompaniment line or solo for a given chord progression. They are also expected to know the rhythmic patterns that are appropriate for different styles (e.g., Afro-Cuban). Bassists playing in a big band must also be able to read written-out bass lines, as some arrangements have written bass parts.\n\nMany upright bass players have contributed to the evolution of jazz. Examples include swing era players such as [[Jimmy Blanton]], who played with [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Oscar Pettiford]], who pioneered the instrument's use in [[bebop]]. [[Paul Chambers]] (who worked with [[Miles Davis]] on the famous ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' album) achieved renown for being one of the first jazz bassists to play bebop solos with the bow. [[Terry Plumeri]] furthered the development of arco (bowed) solos, achieving horn-like technical freedom and a clear, vocal bowed tone, while [[Charlie Haden]], best known for his work with [[Ornette Coleman]], defined the role of the bass in [[Free Jazz]].\n\nA number of other bassists, such as [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Slam Stewart]] and [[Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen]], were central to the history of jazz. Stewart, who was popular with the beboppers, played his solos with a bow combined with octave humming.  Notably, [[Charles Mingus]] was a highly regarded composer as well as a bassist noted for his technical virtuosity and powerful sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/April99/archive-mingus.html |title=Charles Mingus  -A musician beyond category|first=Nat|last= Hentoff|publisher=Gadfly Online|date= April 1999 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> [[Scott LaFaro]] influenced a generation of musicians by liberating the bass from contrapuntal \"walking\" behind soloists instead favoring interactive, conversational melodies.<ref>Scott Yanow, AllMusic Guide, {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p95770|pure_url=yes}} retrieved 3 November 2009.</ref> Since the commercial availability of [[bass amplifier]]s in the 1950s, jazz bassists have used amplification to augment the natural volume of the instrument.\n\nWhile the electric bass guitar was used intermittently in jazz as early as 1951, beginning in the 1970s bassist [[Bob Cranshaw]], playing with saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], and fusion pioneers [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Stanley Clarke]] began to commonly substitute the bass guitar for the upright bass. Apart from the jazz styles of jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz however, the upright bass is still the dominant bass instrument in jazz. The sound and tone of the plucked upright bass is distinct from that of the fretted bass guitar. The upright bass produces a different sound than the bass guitar, because its strings are not stopped by metal [[fret]]s, instead having a continuous tonal range on the uninterrupted fingerboard. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that their sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings, instead of the upright bass's acoustic reverberation.\n\nDemonstrative examples of the sound of a solo double bass and its technical use in jazz can be heard on the solo recordings ''[[Emerald Tears]]'' (1978) by [[Dave Holland]] or ''[[Emergence (Miroslav Vitous album)|Emergence]]'' (1986) by [[Miroslav Vitous]]. Holland also recorded an album with the representative title ''[[Music from Two Basses]]'' (1971) on which he plays with [[Barre Phillips]] while he sometimes switches to cello.\n\n==Use in bluegrass and country==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bluegrass music]] and [[Jim & Jesse]]-->\n{{See also|List of double bassists in popular music}}\nThe string bass is the most commonly used bass instrument in [[bluegrass music]] and is almost always plucked, though some modern bluegrass bassists have also used a bow. The bluegrass bassist is part of the rhythm section, and is responsible for keeping a steady beat, whether fast, slow, in {{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|3|4}} time. The Engelhardt-Link (formerly [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]]) brands of plywood laminate basses have long been popular choices for bluegrass bassists. Most bluegrass bassists use the {{frac|3|4}} size bass, but the full-size and {{frac|5|8}} size basses are also used.\n[[Image:Fiddle bass.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Upright bass used by a bluegrass group; the cable for a piezoelectric pickup can be seen extending from the bridge.]]\n\nEarly pre-bluegrass traditional music was often accompanied by the cello. The cellist Natalie Haas points out that in the US, you can find \"...old photographs, and even old recordings, of American string bands with cello.\" However, \"The cello dropped out of sight in folk music, and became associated with the orchestra.\"<ref>[http://www.allthingsstrings.com/article/default.aspx?articleid=21495 Looming Large: What's a cello got to do with a famous fiddler's tale?

Some contemporary bluegrass bands favor the electric bass, because it is easier to transport than the large and somewhat fragile upright bass. However, the bass guitar has a different musical sound. Many musicians feel the slower attack and percussive, woody tone of the upright bass gives it a more \"earthy\" or \"natural\" sound than an electric bass, particularly when gut strings are used.\n\nCommon rhythms in bluegrass bass playing involve (with some exceptions) plucking on beats 1 and 3 in {{music|time|4|4}} time; beats 1 and 2 in {{music|time|2|4}} time, and on the downbeat in {{music|time|3|4}} time (waltz time). Bluegrass bass lines are usually simple, typically staying on the root and fifth of each chord throughout most of a song. There are two main exceptions to this rule. Bluegrass bassists often do a diatonic ''walkup'' or ''[[walkdown]],'' in which they play every beat of a bar for one or two bars, typically when there is a chord change. In addition, if a bass player is given a solo, they may play a [[walking bass]] line with a note on every beat or play a pentatonic scale-influenced bassline.\n\n[[Image:Riders Bass.jpg|thumb|right|Country music bassist \"Too Slim\" ([[Fred LaBour]] of [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]]) performing in Ponca City, Oklahoma in 2008.]]\nAn early bluegrass bassist to rise to prominence was Howard Watts (also known as Cedric Rainwater), who played with [[Bill Monroe]]'s Blue Grass Boys beginning in 1944.<ref name=\"watts\">[http://doodah.net/bgb/HowardCedricRainwaterWatts.html ''Howard \"Cedric Rainwater\" Watts''], Stewart Evans</ref> The classical bassist [[Edgar Meyer]] has frequently branched out into [[Progressive bluegrass|newgrass]], old-time, jazz, and other genres.\n\"My all-time favorite is [[Todd Phillips (musician)|Todd Phillips]],\" proclaimed Union Station bassist Barry Bales in April 2005. \"He brought a completely different way of thinking about and playing bluegrass.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Richard|title=Barry Bales Expands The Spectrum With Alison Krauss & Union Station|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/barry-bales-expands-the-spectrum-with-alison-krauss--union-station/17886|website=Guitar Player|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131185628/http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/barry-bales-expands-the-spectrum-with-alison-krauss--union-station/17886|archive-date=31 January 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn upright bass was the standard bass instrument in traditional [[country western music]]. While the upright bass is still occasionally used in [[country music]], the electric bass has largely replaced its bigger cousin in country music, especially in the more pop-infused country styles of the 1990s and 2000s, such as [[new country]].\n\n===Slap-style bass===\nSlap-style bass is sometimes used in bluegrass bass playing. When bluegrass bass players slap the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard or hit the strings against the fingerboard, it adds the high-pitched percussive \"clack\" or \"slap\" sound to the low-pitched bass notes, sounding much like the clacks of a tap dancer. Slapping is a subject of minor controversy in the bluegrass scene. Even slapping experts such as [[Mike Bub]] say, \"Don't slap on every gig,\" or in songs where it is not appropriate. As well, bluegrass bassists who play slap-style on live shows often slap less on records. Bub and his mentor [[Jerry McCoury]] rarely do slap bass on recordings. While bassists such as [[Jack Cook]] slap bass on the occasional faster \"Clinch Mountain Boys song,\" bassists such as Gene Libbea, [[Missy Raines]], Jenny Keel, and [[Barry Bales]] [rarely] slap bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibluegrass.com/vi_posting3.CFM?p__i=1004&p__r=&p__a=bass|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030511071642/http://www.ibluegrass.com/vi_posting3.CFM?p__i=1004&p__r=&p__a=bass|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 May 2003|title=Bluegrass Music: iBluegrass.com, Your #1 Source for Bluegrass|date=11 May 2003|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBluegrass bassist Mark Schatz, who teaches slap bass in his ''Intermediate Bluegrass Bass'' DVD acknowledges that slap bass \"...has not been stylistically very predominant in the music I have recorded.\" He notes that \"Even in traditional bluegrass slap bass only appears sporadically and most of what I've done has been on the more contemporary side of that (Tony Rice, Tim O'Brien).\" Schatz states that he would be \"...&nbsp;more likely to use it [slap] in a live situation than on a recording\u2014for a solo or to punctuate a particular place in a song or tune where I wouldn't be obliterating someone's solo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillybass.com/markschatz.htm |title=Learn How to Play Bass Guitar With Free Online Lessons |publisher=Rockabillybass.com |date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref> Another bluegrass method, ''Learn to Play Bluegrass Bass'', by Earl Gately, also teaches bluegrass slap bass technique.

Please help add more names, thanks-->\nIn the early 1950s, the upright bass was the standard bass instrument in the emerging style of [[rock and roll]] music, [[Marshall Lytle]] of [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] being but one example. In the 1940s, a new style of dance music called [[rhythm and blues]] developed, incorporating elements of the earlier styles of blues and swing. [[Louis Jordan]], the first innovator of this style, featured an upright bass in his group, the [[Tympany Five]].<ref name=\"Bartley\">[http://library.missouristate.edu/archives/exhibits/bartley/index.htm ''Dallas Bartley \u2013 Small town Boy: Playing in the bands''], Special Collections and Archives Department, Missouri State University</ref>\n\nThe upright bass remained an integral part of pop lineups throughout the 1950s, as the new genre of [[rock and roll]] was built largely upon the model of rhythm and blues, with strong elements also derived from jazz, country, and bluegrass. However, upright bass players using their instruments in these contexts faced inherent problems. They were forced to compete with louder horn instruments (and later amplified [[electric guitar]]s), making bass parts difficult to hear. The upright bass is difficult to amplify in loud concert venue settings, because it can be prone to [[Audio feedback|feedback]] ''howls''. As well, the upright bass is large and awkward to transport, which also created transportation problems for touring bands. In some groups, the slap bass was utilized as band percussion in lieu of a drummer; such was the case with Bill Haley & His Saddlemen (the forerunner group to the Comets), which did not use drummers on recordings and live performances until late 1952; prior to this the slap bass was relied on for percussion, including on recordings such as Haley's versions of \"[[Rock the Joint]]\" and \"[[Rocket 88]]\".<ref>BBC Radio 2, ''Just Keep on Rockin' '', broadcast 17 April 2004. On this radio documentary, host [[Suzi Quatro]] expresses disbelief that no drums were played on the recording of ''Rock the Joint''.</ref>\n\nIn 1951, [[Leo Fender]] released his [[Precision Bass]], the first commercially successful [[electric bass]] guitar.<ref name=\"p-bass\">[http://mickcervino.com/the-electric-guitar/ ''The Electric Guitar: How We Got From Andr\u00e9s Segovia To Kurt Cobain''], Monica M. Smith</ref> The electric bass was easily amplified with its built-in [[magnetic pickup]]s, easily portable (less than a foot longer than an electric guitar), and easier to play in tune than an upright bass, thanks to the metal frets. In the 1960s and 1970s bands were playing at louder volumes and performing in larger venues. The electric bass was able to provide the huge, highly amplified stadium-filling bass tone that the pop and rock music of this era demanded, and the upright bass receded from the limelight of the popular music scene.\n\nPhotos of bassist [[Miroslav Vitous]]:\n<gallery>\nImage:Miroslav-Vitous01.jpg\nImage:Miroslav-Vitous02.jpg\nImage:Miroslav-Vitous03.jpg\n</gallery>\nThe upright bass began making a comeback in popular music in the mid-1980s, in part due to a renewed interest in earlier forms of folk and country music, as part of the [[roots rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] trends. In the 1990s, improvements in pickups and amplifier designs for electro-acoustic horizontal and upright basses made it easier for bassists to get a good, clear amplified tone from an acoustic instrument. Some popular bands decided to anchor their sound with an upright bass instead of an electric bass, such as the [[Barenaked Ladie]]s. A trend for \"unplugged\" performances on [[MTV]], in which rock bands performed with solely acoustic instruments, further helped to enhance the public's interest in the upright bass and [[acoustic bass guitar]]s.\n\n[[File:JimCreeggan1.JPG|thumb|170px| right|Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies, pictured at a 2009 show.]]\n[[Jim Creeggan]] of [[Barenaked Ladies]] primarily plays upright bass, although he has increasingly played bass guitar throughout the band's career. [[Chris Wyse]] of alternative rock group [[Owl]] uses a combination of electric and double bass. [[Athol Guy]] of the Australian folk/pop group [[The Seekers]] plays an upright bass. [[Shannon Birchall]], of the Australian folk-rock group [[The John Butler Trio]],<ref>\"In Australia, the John Butler Trio has established itself as one of the most successful independent acts in recent history.

On the 2008 album ''[[In Ear Park]]'' by the indie/pop band [[Department of Eagles]], a bowed upright bass is featured quite prominently on the songs \"Teenagers\" and \"In Ear Park\". Norwegian ompa-rock band [[Kaizers Orchestra]] use the upright bass exclusively both live and on their recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaizers.no |title=Kaizers Orchestra official web page |publisher=Kaizers.no |date= |accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\nFrench contemporary pop duet \"What a day\" uses double bass extended pizzicato technique with vocals and type writer<ref>What a day - Closet http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2015/08/08/what-a-day-closet/</ref>\n\n[[Hank Williams III]]'s bass players (Jason Brown, [[Joe Buck (musician)|Joe Buck]] and Zach Shedd, most notably) have used upright basses for recording as well as during the country and Hellbilly sets of Hank III's live performances before switching to electric bass for the [[Assjack]] set.\n\nThe late 1970s rockabilly-punk genre of [[psychobilly]] continued and expanded upon the rockabilly tradition of slap bass. Bassists such as [[Kim Nekroman]] and [[Geoff Kresge]] have developed the ability to play rapid slap bass that in effect turns the bass into a percussion instrument.\n\n==Modern playing styles==\n[[File:Double Bass during the break (photo by Garry Knight).jpg|thumb|right200px|A mid-sized bass amp used to amplify a double bass at a small jazz gig.]]\nIn popular music genres, the instrument is usually played with [[bass instrument amplifier|amplification]] and almost exclusively played with the fingers, ''[[pizzicato]]'' style. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes. The use of amplification allows the player to have more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that allow the bassist to accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise).\n\nAn unamplified acoustic bass's tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which changes the frequency response. In addition, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with held notes.\n\nIn traditional jazz, [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[polka]], rockabilly, and psychobilly music, it is sometimes played in the ''[[Slapping (music)|slap style]]''. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are \"slapped\" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a [[snare drum]]-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolated two, three, four, or more slaps in between notes of the bass line.<!-- Regarding the interpolation of 3 or 4 slaps in between the notes of a bassline...it doesn't seem doable at all when you try it...I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen the youtube videos of the psychobilly bassist from the Necromantix clearly interpolating 3 or 4 slaps in between notes of his bassline! I think he may have downtuned the low E so that it is easier to get it to rebound...I found an old bluegrass method book that says detuning the E is a trick used by some old time bluegrass players to make triple and quadruple slapping easier :)  -->\n\n\"Slap style\" may have influenced electric bass guitar players {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} who, from the mid-sixties (particularly Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone), developed a technique called ''[[Slap-back|slap and pop]]'' that used the thumb of the plucking hand to hit the string, making a slapping sound but still letting the note ring, and the index or middle finger of the plucking hand to pull the string back so it hits the fretboard, achieving the pop sound described above. [[Motown]] bass player [[James Jamerson]] routinely used a double bass for enhancement of the electric bass in post-production (\"sweetening\") of recorded tracks and vice versa in many instances.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Double bassists==\n\n===Historical===\n* [[Domenico Dragonetti]] (1763\u20131846) [[Virtuoso]], composer, conductor\n* [[Giovanni Bottesini]] (1821\u20131889) Virtuoso, composer, conductor\n* [[Franz Simandl]] (1840\u20131912) Virtuoso, composer, [[pedagogue]]\n* [[Edouard Nanny]] (1872\u20131943) Virtuoso, composer\n* [[Serge Koussevitzky]] (1874\u20131951) Virtuoso, composer, conductor\n\n===Modern===\n* [[Gary Karr]] (1941\u2013 ) Virtuoso\n* [[Edgar Meyer]] (1960\u2013 ) Virtuoso, composer, teacher\n\n===Contemporary (1900s)===\n\n====Classical====\n{{See also|List of contemporary classical double bass players}}\n[[File:Gary karr.jpg|thumb|right|Double bass soloist Gary Karr]]\nSome of the most influential contemporary classical double bass players are known as much for their contributions to pedagogy as for their performing skills, such as US bassist [[Oscar G.

[[Eddie G\u00f3mez (musician)|Eddie G\u00f3mez]] and [[George Mraz]], who played with [[Bill Evans]] and [[Oscar Peterson]], respectively, and are both acknowledged to have furthered expectations of pizzicato fluency and melodic phrasing. [[Jazz fusion|Fusion]] virtuoso [[Stanley Clarke]] (born 1951) is notable for his dexterity on both the upright bass and the electric bass. [[Terry Plumeri]] is noted for his horn-like arco fluency and vocal-sounding tone.\n\nIn the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, one of the new \"young lions\" was [[Christian McBride]] (born 1972), who has performed with a range of veterans ranging from [[McCoy Tyner]] to fusion gurus [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Chick Corea]], and who has released albums such as 2003's ''[[Vertical Vision]]''. Another young bassist of note is [[Esperanza Spalding]] (born 1984) who, at 27 years of age, had already won a [[Grammy]] for Best New Artist. For a longer list, see the [[List of jazz bassists]], which includes both double bass and electric bass players.\n\n====Other popular genres====\n[[Image:Scottowen-London2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Scott Owen]], double bass player for Australian rock band [[The Living End]].]]\nIn addition to being a noted classical player, [[Edgar Meyer]] is well known in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[Progressive bluegrass|newgrass]] circles. [[Todd Phillips]] is another prominent bluegrass player. Well-known [[rockabilly]] bassists include [[Bill Black]], [[Marshall Lytle]] (with [[Bill Haley & His Comets]]) and [[Lee Rocker]] (with 1980s-era rockabilly revivalists the [[Stray Cats]]).\n\nNotable rockabilly revivalists and [[psychobilly]] performers from the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century include [[Scott Owen]] (from the Australian band [[The Living End]]), [[Jimbo Wallace]] (from the US band [[Reverend Horton Heat]]), [[Kim Nekroman]] ([[Nekromantix]]), [[Patricia Day]] ([[HorrorPops]]), [[Geoff Kresge]] ([[Tiger Army]], ex-[[AFI (band)|AFI]]). [[Willie Dixon]] (1915\u20131992) was one of the most notable figures in the history of [[rhythm and blues]]. In addition to being an upright bassist, he wrote dozens of R&B hits and worked as a producer. He also plays bass on numerous [[Chuck Berry]]'s rock and roll hits. Many other [[rockabilly]] bands like El Rio Trio (from the Netherlands) also use this instrument in their work. See also the [[List of double bassists in popular music]].\n\n==Pedagogy and training==\nThe pedagogy and training for the double bass varies widely by genre and country. Classical double bass has a history of pedagogy dating back several centuries, including teaching manuals, studies, and progressive exercises that help students to develop the endurance and accuracy of the left hand, and control for the bowing hand. Classical training methods vary by country: many of the major European countries are associated with specific methods (e.g., the [[Edouard Nanny]] method in France or the [[Franz Simandl]] method in Germany). In classical training, the majority of the instruction for the right hand focuses on the production of bowing tone; little time is spent studying the varieties of pizzicato tone.\n\nIn contrast, in genres that mainly or exclusively use pizzicato (plucking), such as jazz and blues, a great deal of time and effort is focused on learning the varieties of different pizzicato styles used for music of different styles of tempi. For example, in jazz, aspiring bassists have to learn how to perform a wide range of pizzicato tones, including using the sides of the fingers to create a full, deep sound for ballads, using the tips of the fingers for fast walking basslines or solos, and performing a variety of percussive ''ghost notes'' by raking muted or partially muted strings.\n\n===Formal training===\n[[File:Nobel Peace Price Concert 2009 Esperanza Spalding1.jpg|thumb|upright|Jazz singer/bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]] performing on 10 December 2009 at the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] of 2009]]\nOf all of the genres, classical and jazz have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training. In the classical milieu, children can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in children's or youth orchestras. Teens who aspire to becoming professional classical bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. Colleges offer certificates and diplomas in bass performance.\n\n[[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral experience for double bass players. Universities offer a range of double bass programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and orchestral, opera, or chamber music training festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of music.\n\nBachelor's degrees in bass performance (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M.) are four-year programs that include individual bass lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, bass performance students perform several recitals of solo double bass music, such as concertos, sonatas, and Baroque suites.\n\nMaster of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in double bass performance consist of private lessons, ensemble experience, coaching in playing orchestral double bass parts, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two solo recitals. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often a required credential for people who wish to become a professor of double bass at a university or conservatory.\n[[File:TimothyBCobb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|Manhattan School of Music professor [[Timothy Cobb]] teaching a bass lesson in the late 2000s. His bass has a low C extension with a metal \"machine\" with buttons for playing the pitches on the extension.]]\n\nDoctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D.) degrees in double bass performance provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination-recital, are required. Students perform a number of recitals (around six), including a lecture-recital with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework, and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A. program.\n\nThroughout the early history of jazz, double bass players either learned the instrument informally, or from getting classical training early on, as in the case of Ron Carter and Charles Mingus. In the 1980s and 1990s, colleges and universities began to introduce diplomas and degrees in jazz performance. Students in jazz diploma or Bachelor of Music programs take individual bass lessons, get experience in small jazz combos with coaching from an experienced player, and play in jazz big bands. As with classical training programs, jazz programs also include classroom courses in music history and music theory. In a jazz program, these courses focus on the different eras of jazz history. such as Swing, Bebop, and fusion. The theory courses focus on the musical skills used in jazz improvisation and in jazz comping (accompanying) and the composition of jazz tunes. There are also jazz summer camps and training festivals/seminars, which offer students the chance to learn new skills and styles.\n\n===Informal training===\nIn other genres, such as blues, rockabilly, and psychobilly, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are not as formalized and institutionalized. There are not degrees in blues bass performance, or conservatories offering multiple-year diplomas in rockabilly bass. However, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., on how to play rockabilly-style slap bass). As such, performers in these other genres tend to come from a variety of routes, including informal learning by using bass method books or DVDs, taking private lessons and coaching, and learning from records and CDs. In some cases, blues or rockabilly bassists may have obtained some initial training through the classical or jazz pedagogy systems (e.g., youth orchestra or high school big band). In genres such as tango, which use a lot of bowed passages and jazz-style pizzicato lines, the bassists tend to come from classical or jazz training routes.\n\n==Careers==\nCareers in double bass vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most bassists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, bassists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as ''Now's the Time'') with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play various rock or blues standards. An upright bassist auditioning for a blues band might be asked to play in a Swing-style walking [[bassline]], a rockabilly-style [[Slap bass|\"slapping\"]] bassline (in which the strings are percussively struck against the fingerboard) and a 1950s ballad with long held notes. A person auditioning for a role as a bassist in some styles of pop or rock music may be expected to demonstrate the ability to perform [[harmony vocals]] as a [[backup singer]]. In some pop and rock groups, the bassist may be asked to play other instruments from time to time, such as electric bass, keyboards or acoustic guitar. The ability to play electric bass is widely expected in country groups, in case the band is performing a [[classic rock]] or [[new country]] song. \n[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006311 021 Musiker mit einem Kontrabass.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A German double bass section in 1952. The player to the left is using a German bow.]]\n\n===Classical music===\nIn [[classical music]], bassists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical bass audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a [[J.S. Bach suite for solo cello]] or a movement from a bass concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts of bass parts and bass solos from the orchestral literature. Some of the most commonly requested orchestral excerpts at bass auditions are from [[Beethoven]]'s Symphonies Nos.&nbsp;5, 7 and 9; [[Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' and ''Don Juan''; [[Mozart]]'s Symphonies Nos.&nbsp;35, 39 and 40; [[Brahms]]' Symphonies Nos.&nbsp;1 and 2; [[Stravinsky]]'s Pulcinella; [[Shostakovich]]'s Symphony No.&nbsp;5; [[Ginastera]]'s ''Variaciones Concertante''; [[Tchaikovsky]]'s Symphony No.&nbsp;4; [[Mahler]]'s Symphony No.&nbsp;2; J.&nbsp;S. Bach's Suite No.&nbsp;2 in B; [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'', [[Mendelssohn]]'s Symphony No.&nbsp;4; and the bass solos from [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Otello]]'', [[Mahler]]'s Symphony No.&nbsp;1, [[Britten]]'s ''[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]]'' and [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason |url=http://doublebassblog.org/2006/12/double-bass-orchestral-audition-lists-a-survey.html |title=Double Bass Orchestral Audition Lists \u2013 A Survey \u2013 Jason Heath's Double Bass Blog |publisher=Doublebassblog.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites Performed on Double Bass]]''\n* [[Double bass concerto]]\n* [[Electric upright bass]]\n* [[List of historical classical double bass players]]\n* [[Octobass]]\n* [[Triple contrabass viol]]\n* [[Piccolo bass]]\n* [[Tololoche]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Double bass}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Double basses}}\n* {{dmoz|/Arts/Music/Instruments/Stringed/Bowed_Strings/Bass/|Bass}}\n* [http://www.EarlyBass.com EarlyBass.com by Jerry Fuller]\n* [http://www.paulnemeth.com/basschamber.htm List of chamber music pieces with double bass]\n* [http://ludowe.instrumenty.edu.pl/en/instruments-/categories/category/317 Polish folk music double basses]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{Bass (sound)}}\n{{Violin family}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bass (sound)]]\n[[Category:Bowed instruments]]\n[[Category:Compositions for double bass| ]]\n[[Category:Continuous pitch instruments]]\n[[Category:Contrabass instruments]]\n[[Category:Double basses]]\n[[Category:Double-bassists| ]]\n[[Category:String instruments]]\n[[Category:C instruments]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\n[[Category:Jazz instruments]]\n[[Category:Rockabilly instruments]]\n[[Category:Blues instruments]]\n[[Category:Amplified instruments]]\n[[Category:Folk music instruments]]\n[[Category:Bowed strings]]\n[[Category:Orchestral instruments]]\n[[Category:String section]]\n[[Category:Western Classical music instruments]]\n[[Category:Baroque instruments]]\n[[Category:Basso continuo instruments]]", "sha1": "m5pgtezdnd4tazil0ytcbcq6l9m1gay"}}, {"title": "Deicide (band)", "ns": "0", "id": "8817", "revision": {"id": "862692386", "parentid": "860573706", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T02:05:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "Sixty Minute Limit", "id": "33599302"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Deicide\n| image                 = Deicide-Live-Metaltown 2011.jpg\n| caption            = Deicide performing live at [[Metaltown]] Festival in June 2011\n| image_size            = 250\n| landscape           = yes\n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = Carnage (1987)<br />Amon (1987-1989)\n| origin              = [[Tampa, Florida]], United States\n| genre               = [[Death metal]]\n| years_active        = 1987\u2013present\n| label               = {{flatlist|\n* [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]]\n* [[Earache Records|Earache]]\n* [[Century Media Records|Century Media]]}}\n| associated_acts     = {{flatlist|\n* [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]\n* [[Cannibal Corpse]]\n* [[Vital Remains]]\n* [[Adrift (band)|Adrift]]\n* [[Order of Ennead]]}}\n| website                 =\n| current_members     = [[Steve Asheim]]<br />[[Glen Benton]]<br />Kevin Quirion<br />Mark English\n| past_members        = Eric Hoffman<br />Brian Hoffman<br />Dave Suzuki<br />Ralph Santolla <br />[[Jack Owen]]\n}}\n\n'''Deicide''' is an American [[death metal]] band formed in 1987 by drummer [[Steve Asheim]] and guitarist brothers Eric and Brian Hoffman as \"Carnage\", then hiring bassist/vocalist [[Glen Benton]] and becoming \"Amon\".

The bomb was located to the rear of the stage, behind a heavy, fireproof door. The explosion was big enough to deform the door and blow it off its hinges. Deicide managed to play three songs before the police decided to stop the concert and evacuate the club. At first, Benton blamed that attack on the Norwegian [[black metal]] scene, where Deicide's brand of death metal was despised. Many people blamed [[animal rights]] [[activists]] who were angered at Deicide's lyrical themes of animal sacrifice.<ref>Ekeroth, Daniel (2006).
