The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audio tape that releases a legion of [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s, members of the group suffer from [[demonic possession]], leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the [[short film]] ''[[Within the Woods]]'' as a \"prototype\" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce ''The Evil Dead''. The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in [[Morristown, Tennessee]], in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the cast and crew.\n\nThe low-budget horror film attracted the interest of producer [[Irvin Shapiro]], who helped screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. Horror author [[Stephen King]] gave a rave review of the film, which helped convince [[New Line Cinema]] to serve as its distributor. Though a modest commercial success in the United States, grossing just $2.4 million, it was a bigger success internationally, grossing more than $27 million for a worldwide gross of $29.4 million. Both early and later critical reception were universally positive and in the years since its release, ''The Evil Dead'' has developed a reputation as one of the largest [[cult film]]s and has been cited among the greatest horror films of all time. ''The Evil Dead'' launched the careers of Campbell and Raimi, who would collaborate on several films together throughout the years, including Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].\n\nThe film has spawned a [[Evil Dead (franchise)|media franchise]], beginning with two [[sequel]]s written and directed by Raimi, ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992), as well as video games, [[Army of Darkness (comics)|comic books]], and a television series. The film's protagonist [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is regarded as a cult icon. The fourth film, serving as reboot, remake and sequel, was titled ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' and was released in 2013. Raimi co-produced the film alongside Campbell and the franchise producer, [[Robert Tapert]]. As with the other films, the follow-up television series ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'' was created and produced by [[Sam Raimi|Sam]] and [[Ivan Raimi]], with Campbell also executive producing.\n\n==Plot==\nFive [[Michigan State University]] students\u2014[[Ash Williams]], his girlfriend, Linda; Ash's sister, Cheryl; their friend Scott; and his girlfriend Shelly\u2014are vacationing at an isolated cabin in rural [[Tennessee]]. On their first night there, Cheryl hears a faint, demonic voice telling her to \"join us\" just before her hand seems to become possessed and draw a picture of a book with a deformed face on its cover. Shaken but confused,  she decides not to mention the incident to the others.\n\nWhen the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scott go down to investigate and find the ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Naturan Demanto]]'', a [[Sumer]]ian version of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', along with a [[tape recorder]] belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. Scott plays plays a tape of the archaeologist reciting a series of [[incantation]]s that resurrect a mysterious, demonic entity. Agitated, Cheryl goes outside to investigate strange noises she has heard. In the woods, she is raped by [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]] trees. When she returns to the cabin bruised and anguished, Ash agrees to take her into town for the night. However, they soon discovers that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning that the only way to kill the entity is to dismember the body when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scott is able to lock her in the cellar.\n\nShelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scott to chop up her body with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves to find a way back to town but soon returns mortally wounded; he dies while warning Ash that the trees will not let them escape alive. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she too has become possessed by the demon. She attacks him, but stabs her with a Sumerian dagger. Unwilling to dismember her, he buries her instead. But when she revives and attacks him, he is forced to decapitate her. \n\nBack in the cabin, Ash is attacked by Cheryl, who has escaped the cellar, and the reanimated Scott. Ash manages to throw the Naturan Demanto into the fireplace. As the book burns, Scott and Cheryl gruesomely decompose, leaving the disgusted Ash covered in their blood and entrails. As day breaks, Ash stumbles outside. Before he can get in his car to leave, the entity attacks him from behind, dragging him screaming into the woods.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]]\n*[[Ellen Sandweiss]] as Cheryl Williams\n*Hal Delrich as Scott\n*[[Betsy Baker]] as Linda\n*Sarah York as Shelly\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=A man sitting next to a microphone placed on a table.|[[Sam Raimi]] directed the short film ''[[Within the Woods]]'' to generate the interest of investors for ''The Evil Dead''. |thumb|right|upright]]\n\n===Background and writing===\nRaimi and Campbell grew up together, and have been friends from an early age.<ref name=\"early2\">[[#Winston Dixon|Winston Dixon (2010)]], p. 161</ref> The duo directed several low-budget [[Super 8 mm film]] projects together.<ref name=\"early\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 65</ref> Several were comedies, including ''[[Clockwork (film)|Clockwork]]'' and ''[[It's Murder!]]''.<ref name=\"def\">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 16</ref><ref name=\"writing\"/> Shooting a suspense scene in ''It's Murder!'' inspired Raimi to approach a career in the horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at [[drive-in theater]]s, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to shoot a short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then use the money gained from that to shoot a full-length project.<ref name=\"writing\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 66</ref><ref name=\"becker\">[[#Becker|Becker (2002)]], p. 64</ref> The [[short film]] that Raimi created was called ''[[Within the Woods]]''.<ref name=\"proto\">[[#Lamberson|Lamberson (2008)]], p. 84</ref> It was produced for $1,600, but for ''The Evil Dead'', Raimi needed over $100,000.<ref name=\"money\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;85\u201388</ref>\n\nTo generate funds for the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends.<ref name=\"money\"/><ref name=\"reinforced\"/> Raimi showed him ''Within the Woods'', and although Gillis was not impressed by the short film, he offered Raimi legal advice on how to produce ''The Evil Dead''. With his advice in mind, Raimi asked a variety of people for donations, and even eventually \"begged\" some.<ref name=\"money\"/> Campbell had to ask several of his own family members, and Raimi asked every individual he thought might be interested.<ref name=\"money\"/> He eventually raised enough money to produce a full-length film, though not the full amount he originally wanted.<ref name=\"money\"/>\n\nWith enough money to produce the film, Raimi and Campbell set out to make what was then titled ''Book of the Dead'', a name inspired by Raimi's interest in the fiction of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].<ref name=\"writing\"/><ref name=\"thingstoknow\"/> The film was supposed to be a remake of ''Within the Woods'', with higher production values and a full-length running time.

[[Betsy Baker]] was one of the actresses who responded, and [[Ellen Sandweiss]], who appeared in ''Within the Woods'', was also cast.<ref name=\"ninety five\"/> The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for ''Within the Woods'', Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.<ref name=\"EVIL2\"/>\n\nWithout any formal assistance from location scouts, the cast had to find filming locations on their own. The crew initially attempted to shoot the film in Raimi's hometown of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], but instead chose [[Morristown, Tennessee]], as it was the only state that expressed enthusiasm for the project. The crew quickly found a remote cabin located several miles away from any other buildings.  During pre-production, the 13 crew members had to stay at the cabin, leading to several people sleeping in the same room. The living conditions were notoriously difficult, with several arguments breaking out between crew members.<ref name=\"cabin\"/>\n\nSteve Frankel was the only carpenter on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor.<ref name=\"weird\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;93\u201394</ref> For exterior shots, Frankel had to produce several elaborate props with a circular saw. Otherwise, the cabin mostly remained the way it was found during production.

The crew was surprised when Raimi began using [[dutch angle]]s during shots to build atmosphere during scenes.<ref name=\"raimi\"/> To accommodate Raimi's style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a [[camera dolly]]. One involved the \"vas-o-cam\", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down long wooden platforms to create a more fluid sense of motion.<ref name=\"raimi\"/>\n\n[[File:WW Chicago 2015 - Evil Dead 15 (21037548012).jpg|Sam Raimi's brother [[Ted Raimi]] was the \"[[fake shemp]]\" in several scenes.|thumb|left|upright]]\n\nA camera trick used to emulate a [[Steadicam]] inexpensively was the \"[[shaky camera|shaky cam]]\", which involved mounting the camera to a piece of wood and having two camera operators sprint around the swamp.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/454928-low-budget-camera-tech-sam-raimis-evil-dead/|title=The Low Budget Camera Tech of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead|author=Konow, David|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref> During scenes involving the unseen force in the woods watching the characters, Raimi had to run through the woods with the makeshift rig, jumping over logs and stones.<ref name=\"raimi\"/> This often proved difficult due to mist in the swamp.<ref>[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 309</ref> The film's final scene was shot with the camera mounted to a bike, while it was quickly driven through the cabin to create a seamless [[long take]].<ref name=\"raimi\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p.&nbsp;102\u2013103</ref>\n\nRaimi had been a big fan of ''[[The Three Stooges]]'' franchise during his youth, and it inspired him to use \"[[Fake Shemp]]s\" during production.<ref name=\"def\"/><ref name=\"reinforced\">[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&nbsp;412\u2013413</ref><ref>[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 115</ref> In any scene that required a background shot of a character, he would use another actor as a substitute to save time if the original actor was preoccupied.<ref name=\"shemp\"/> During a [[close-up]] involving Richard DeManicor's hand opening a curtain, Raimi used his own hand in the scene since it was more convenient.

It was then edited down to a more marketable 85 minutes.<ref name=\"editing\"/>  Raimi was inspired by the fact that [[Brian De Palma]] was editing his own film ''[[Blow Out]]'' with [[John Travolta]] at the same sound facility.<ref name=\"editing\"/> One of the most intricate moments during editing was the [[stop-motion]] sequence where the corpses \"melted\", which took hours to cut properly.<ref name=\"editing\"/> The film had unique sounds that required extensive recording from the crew.<ref name=\"editing\"/><ref name=\"kawin\">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 17</ref> Several sounds were not recorded properly during shooting, which meant the effects had to be redone in the editing rooms. Dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sounds of mutilated flesh, and Campbell had to scream into a microphone for several hours.<ref name=\"editing\"/>\n\nMuch like ''Within the Woods'', ''The Evil Dead'' needed to be blown up to 35mm, then the industry standard, to be played at movie theaters.<ref name=\"editing\"/> The relatively large budget made this a much simpler process with ''The Evil Dead'' than it had been with the short film.<ref name=\"editing\"/>\n\n==Promotion and distribution rights==\n[[File:RedfordTheatreMarquee.jpg|alt=View of a movie theater marquee.|thumb|right|''The Evil Dead'' premiered at the [[Redford Theatre]] because Bruce Campbell watched films there as a child.]]\nWith the film completed, Raimi and the crew decided to celebrate with a \"big premiere\".<ref name=\"premiere\"/> They chose to screen the film at Detroit's [[Redford Theatre]], which Campbell had often visited as a child.<ref name=\"reinforced2\"/> Raimi opted to have the most theatrical premiere possible, using custom tickets and wind tracks set in the theater, and ordering ambulances outside the theater to build atmosphere.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref>[[#F.

Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually going with ''The Evil Dead'', deemed the \"least worst\" title.<ref name=\"casa\"/> Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape together what little money he had.<ref name=\"casa\"/>\n\n[[File:Stephen King, Comicon.jpg|alt=Close-up of a man wearing glasses.|thumb|left|upright|[[Stephen King]] cited ''The Evil Dead'' as one of his favorite films, which brought the interest of [[New Line Cinema]].]]\nShapiro was a founder of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and allowed Raimi to screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|1982 festival]] out of competition.<ref name=\"fuckyeah\">[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 24</ref><ref name=\"cannes\"/> [[Stephen King]] was present at its screening and gave the film a rave review.

''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1\u201340, 201\u201343.</ref> In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual [[subjective value theory|subjective values]] are translated into the objective information necessary for [[Rational choice theory|rational]] allocation of resources in society.<ref name=\"Mises\"/>\n\nIn market exchanges, prices reflect the [[supply and demand]] of resources, labor, and products. In his first article, Mises focused his criticism on the inevitable deficiencies of the [[Socialization (economics)|socialisation]] of capital goods, but Mises later went on to elaborate on various different forms of socialism in his book, ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]''. Mises and Hayek argued that economic calculation is only possible by information provided through market prices, and that bureaucratic or technocratic methods of allocation lack methods to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by [[Economic history|economic historians]] as ''The [[Socialist Calculation Debate]]''. Mises' initial criticism received multiple reactions and led to the conception of trial-and-error [[market socialism]], most notably the [[Lange\u2013Lerner theorem]].\n\nIn the 1920 paper, Mises argued that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if a public entity owned all the [[means of production]], no rational prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods and not \"objects of exchange\", unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily irrational, as the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.<ref name=\"Mises\" /> He wrote that \"rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]\".<ref name=\"Mises\" /> Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book ''Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis'', arguing that the market price system is an expression of [[praxeology]] and can not be replicated by any form of bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that central planning has been criticized by socialists who advocated decentralized mechanisms of economic coordination, including [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]] before the [[Austrian school]] critique. Central planning was later criticized by socialist economists such as [[Janos Kornai]] and [[Alec Nove]]. [[Robin Cox]] has argued that the economic calculation argument can only be successfully rebutted on the assumption that a moneyless socialist economy was to a large extent spontaneously ordered via a self-regulating system of stock control which would enable decision-makers to allocate production goods on the basis of their relative scarcity using calculation in kind.  This was only feasible in an economy where most decisions were decentralised.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/215256501/The-Economic-Calculation-Controversy-Unravelling-of-a-Myth|title=The Economic Calculation Controversy, Unravelling of a Myth {{!}} Socialism {{!}} Capitalism|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}</ref> \n==Theory==\n\n=== Comparing heterogeneous goods ===\nSince  capital goods and [[Labour economics|labor]] are highly heterogeneous (i.e., they have different characteristics that pertain to physical productivity), economic calculation requires a common basis for comparison for all forms of capital and labour.\n\n[[Money]], as a [[means of exchange]], enables buyers to compare the costs of goods without having knowledge of their underlying factors; the consumer can simply focus on his personal cost-benefit decision. The price system is therefore said to promote economically efficient use of resources by agents who may not have explicit knowledge of all of the conditions of production or supply. This is called the [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]] function of [[price]]s, as well as the [[rationing]] function which prevents over-use of any resource.<ref>{{Murray N. Rothbard, \"Man, Economy and the State\" Chapter VIII Paragraph 6. pag. 498\n}}</ref>\n\nWithout the market process to fulfill such comparisons, critics of non-market socialism say that it lacks any way to compare different goods and services and would have to rely on [[calculation in kind]]. The resulting decisions, it is claimed, would therefore be made without sufficient knowledge to be considered rational.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Relating utility to capital and consumption goods===\nThe common basis for comparison for capital goods must also be connected to [[consumer welfare]]. It must also be able to compare the desired trade-off between present consumption and delayed consumption (for greater returns later on), via investment in capital goods. The use of money as a medium of exchange and unit of account is necessary to solve the first two problems of economic calculation. Mises (1912) applied the [[marginal utility theory]] developed by [[Carl Menger]] to money.\n\nMarginal consumer expenditures represent the marginal utility or additional consumer satisfaction expected by consumers as they spend money. This is similar to the ''equi-marginal principle'' developed by [[Alfred Marshall]]. Consumers equalize the marginal utility (amount of satisfaction) of the last dollar spent on each good. So the exchange of consumer goods establishes prices that represent the marginal utility of consumers, and money therefore is representative of consumer satisfaction.\n\nIf money is also spent on capital goods and labor, then it is possible to make comparisons between capital goods and consumer goods. The exchange of consumer and capital/labor goods does not imply that capital goods are valued accurately, only that it is possible for the valuations of capital goods to be made.\n\nThese first elements of the Calculation Critique of Socialism are the most basic element: economic calculation requires the use of money across all goods. This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for successful economic calculation.\n\nWithout a price mechanism, Mises argues, socialism lacks the means to relate consumer satisfaction to economic activity. The incentive function of prices allows diffuse interests, like the interests of every household in cheap, high quality shoes, to compete with the concentrated interests of the cobblers in expensive, poor quality shoes. Without it, a panel of experts set up to \u2018rationalise production\u2019, likely closely linked to the cobblers for expertise, would tend to support the cobblers interests in a \u2018conspiracy against the public\u2019. If this happens to all industries however, everyone would be worse off than if they had been subject to the rigours of [[market competition]].\n\nThe von Mises theory of money and calculation conflicts directly with Marxist [[labour theory of value]]. Marxist theory allows for the possibility that Labour content can serve as a common means of valuing capital goods, a position now out of favour with economists following the success of the theory of [[marginal utility]].\n\n===Entrepreneurship===\nThe third condition for economic calculation is the existence of genuine [[entrepreneurship]] and [[Competition (economics)|market rivalry]].\n\nAccording to Kirzner (1973) and Lavoie (1985) entrepreneurs reap profits by supplying unfulfilled needs in all markets. Entrepreneurship therefore brings prices closer to marginal costs. The adjustment of prices in markets towards \u2018equilibrium\u2019 (where supply and demand equal) gives them greater utilitarian significance. The activities of entrepreneurs make prices more accurate in terms of how they represent the marginal utility of consumers. Prices act as guides to the planning of production. Those who plan production use prices to decide which lines of production should be expanded or curtailed.\n\nEntrepreneurs lack the [[profit motive]] to take risks under socialism, and so are far less likely to attempt to supply consumer demands. Without the price system to match consumer utility to incentives for production, or even indicate those utilities \"without providing incentives\", state planners are much less likely to invest in new ideas to satisfy consumers' desires.\n\n===Coherent planning===\nThe fourth condition for successful economic calculation is plan coordination among those who plan production. The problem of planning production is the knowledge problem explained by Hayek (1937, 1945), but first mentioned and illustrated by his mentor Ludwig von Mises in ''Socialism'' (1922), not to be mistaken with ''Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis'' (1951). The planning could either be done in a decentralised fashion, requiring some mechanism to make the individual plans coherent, or centrally, requiring a lot of information.\n\nWithin capitalism, the overall plan for production is composed of individual plans from capitalists in large and small enterprises. Since capitalists purchase labour and capital out of the same common pool of available but scarce labor and capital, it is essential that their plans fit together in at least a semi-coherent fashion. Hayek (1937) defined an efficient planning process as one where all decision makers form plans that contain relevant data from the plans from others. Entrepreneurs acquire data on the plans from others through the price system. The price system is an indispensable communications network for plan coordination among entrepreneurs. Increases and decreases in prices inform entrepreneurs about the general economic situation, to which they must adjust their own plans.\n\nAs for socialism, Mises (1944) and Hayek (1937) insisted that bureaucrats in individual ministries could not coordinate their plans without a price system. If decentralized socialism cannot work, central authorities must plan production. But central planners face [[local knowledge problem|the local knowledge problem]] in forming a comprehensive plan for production. Mises and Hayek saw centralization as inevitable in socialism.\n\nOpponents argued that in principle an economy can be seen as a set of equations. Thus, there should be no need for prices. Using information about available resources and the preferences of people, it should be possible to calculate an optimal solution for resource allocation. [[Friedrich von Hayek]] responded that the system of equations required too much information that would not be easily available and the ensuing calculations would be too difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This is partly because individuals possess useful knowledge but do not realise its importance, may have no incentive to transmit the information, or may have incentive to transmit false information about their preferences.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Hayek\n| first = Friedrich\n| authorlink = Friedrich Hayek\n| title = [[The Road to Serfdom]]\n| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]\n| edition = 50th anniversary\n| year = 1994\n| isbn =  0-226-32061-8}}</ref>\nHe contended that the only rational solution is to utilize all the [[dispersed knowledge]] in the market place through the use of [[price signal]]s.<ref>{{cite book\n|last= Steele\n|first= David Ramsay\n|authorlink= David Ramsay Steele\n|title= From Marx to Mises: post-capitalist society and the challenge of economic calculation\n|year= 1992\n|publisher= Open Court\n|location= La Salle, Ill.\n|isbn= 0-8126-9016-8}}</ref>  The early debates were made before the much greater calculating powers of modern [[computers]] became available but also before research on [[chaos theory]].

Retrieved 04.jan.2015</ref>\n\nHayek (1935, 1937, 1940, 1945) stressed the knowledge problem of central planning, partly because decentralized socialism seemed indefensible. Part of the reason that Hayek stressed the knowledge problem was also because he was mainly concerned with debating the proposal for [[market socialism]] and the [[Lange Model]] by [[Oskar R. Lange]] (1938) and Hayek's student [[Abba Lerner]] (1934, 1937, 1938), which was developed in response to the calculation argument. Lange and Lerner conceded that prices were necessary in socialism. Lange and Lerner thought that socialist officials could simulate some markets (mainly spot markets) and the simulation of spot markets was enough to make socialism reasonably efficient. [[Oskar Lange]] argued that prices can be seen merely as an accounting practice. In principle, claim market socialists, socialist managers of state enterprises could use a price system, as an accounting system, in order to minimize costs and convey information to other managers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, while this can deal with existing stocks of goods, providing a basis for values can be ascertained, it does not deal with the investment in new capital stocks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nHayek responded by arguing that the simulation of markets in socialism would fail due to a lack of genuine competition and entrepreneurship. Central planners would still have to plan production without the aid of economically meaningful prices. Lange and Lerner also admitted that socialism would lack any simulation of financial markets, and that this would cause problems in planning capital investment.\n\nHayek's argumentation is not only regarding computational complexity for the central planners, however. He further argues that much of the information individuals have cannot be collected or used by others. First, individuals may have no or little [[incentive]] to share their information with central or even local planners. Second, the individual may not be aware that he has valuable information, and when he becomes aware, it is only useful for a limited time, too short for it to be communicated to the central or local planners. Third, the information is useless to other individuals if it is not in a form that allows for meaningful comparisons of value (i.e., money prices as a common basis for comparison). Therefore, Hayek argues, individuals must acquire data through prices in real markets.<ref>{{cite web\n |first       = Carlo\n |last        = Zappia\n |authorlink  = Carlo Zappia\n |title       = The economics of information, market socialism and Hayek's legacy\n |url         = http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf\n |format      = PDF\n |accessdate  = 2007-04-03\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614110711/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/pubdocenti/HEI99.pdf\n |archivedate = 2007-06-14\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n===Financial markets===\nThe fifth condition for successful economic calculation is the existence of well functioning [[financial market]]s. Economic efficiency depends heavily upon avoiding errors in capital investment. The costs of reversing errors in capital investment are potentially large. This is not just a matter of rearranging or converting capital goods that are found to be of little use. The time spent reconfiguring the structure of production is time lost in the production of consumer goods. Those who plan capital investment must anticipate future trends in consumer demand if they are to avoid investing too much in some lines of production and too little in other lines of production.\n\nCapitalists plan production for profit. Capitalists use prices to form expectations that determine the composition of capital accumulation, the pattern of investment across industry. Those who invest in accordance with consumers' desires are rewarded with profits, those who do not are forced to become more efficient or go out of business.\n\nPrices in [[futures markets]] play a special role in economic calculation. Futures markets develop prices for commodities in future time periods. It is in futures markets that entrepreneurs sort out plans for production based on their expectations. Futures markets are a link between entrepreneurial investment decisions and household consumer decisions. Since most goods are not explicitly traded in futures markets, substitute markets are needed. The stock market serves as a \u2018continuous futures market\u2019 that evaluates entrepreneurial plans for production (Lachmann 1978). Generally speaking the problem of economic calculation is solved in financial markets.\n\n{{quote|The problem of economic calculation arises in an economy which is perpetually subject to change ... In order to solve such problems it is above all necessary that capital be withdrawn from particular undertakings and applied in other lines of production ... [This] is essentially a matter of the capitalists who buy and sell stocks and shares, who make loans and recover them, who speculate in all kinds of commodities.<ref>Mises 1922 [1936] p. 121</ref>}}\n\nThe existence of financial markets is a necessary condition for economic calculation. The existence of financial markets itself does not automatically imply that entrepreneurial speculation will tend towards efficiency. Mises argued that speculation in financial markets tends towards efficiency because of a \u201ctrial and error\u201d process. Entrepreneurs who commit relatively large errors in investment waste their funds over expanding some lines of production at the cost of other more profitable ventures where consumer demand is higher. The entrepreneurs who commit the worst errors by forming the least accurate expectations of future consumer demands incur financial losses. Financial losses remove these inept entrepreneurs from positions of authority in industry.\n\nEntrepreneurs who commit smaller errors by anticipating consumer demand more correctly attain greater financial success. The entrepreneurs who form the most accurate opinions regarding the future state of markets (i.e., new trends in consumer demands) earn the highest profits and gain greater control of industry. Those entrepreneurs who anticipate future market trends therefore waste the least amount of real capital and find the most favorable terms for finance on markets for financial capital. Minimal waste of real capital goods implies the minimization of the opportunity costs of capital- economic calculation. The value of capital goods is brought into line with the value of future consumer goods through competition in financial markets, because competition for profits among capitalist financiers rewards entrepreneurs who value capital more correctly (i.e., anticipating future prices more correctly) and eliminates capitalists who value capital least correctly.\n\nTo sum things up, the use of money in trading all goods (capital/labor and consumer) in all markets (spot and financial) combined with profit driven entrepreneurship and Darwinian natural selection in financial markets all combine to make rational economic calculation and allocation the outcome of the capitalist process.\n\nMises insisted that socialist calculation is impossible because socialism precludes the exchange of capital goods in terms of a generally accepted medium of exchange, or money. Investment in financial markets determines the capital structure of modern industry with some degree of efficiency. The egalitarian nature of socialism prohibits speculation in financial markets. Mises therefore concluded that socialism lacks any clear tendency towards improvement in the capital structure of industry.\n\n===Example===\nLudwig von Mises gave the example of choosing between producing wine or oil:\n{{quote|\nIt will be evident, even in the socialist society, that 1,000 hectolitres of wine are better than 800, and it is not difficult to decide whether it desires 1,000 hectolitres of wine rather than 500 of oil. There is no need for any system of calculation to establish this fact: the deciding element is the will of the economic subjects involved. But once this decision has been taken, the real task of rational economic direction only commences, i.e., economically, to place the means at the service of the end. That can only be done with some kind of economic calculation. The human mind cannot orient itself properly among the bewildering mass of intermediate products and potentialities of production without such aid. It would simply stand perplexed before the problems of management and location.<ref name=\"Mises\" />}}\n\nSuch intermediate products would include land, warehouse storage, bottles, barrels, oil, transport, etc. Not only would these things have to be assembled, but they would have to compete with the attainment of other economic goals. Without pricing for capital goods, essentially, Mises is arguing, it is impossible to know what their rational/most efficient use is. Investment is particularly impossible, as the potential future outputs cannot be measured by any current standard, let alone a monetary one required for economic calculation. The value consumers have for current consumption over future consumption cannot be expressed, quantified or implemented, as investment is independent from savings.\n\n<!-- THIS IS A PROBLEM OF CENTRAL PLANNING, NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC CALCULATION.  IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE MOVED TO THE CENTRAL PLANNING PAGE.\n\n==Implementation of central planning decisions==\nHayek, in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', also argues that the central administrative resource allocation, which often must take away resources and power from subordinate leader and groups, necessarily requires and therefore selects ruthless leaders and the continued strong threat of coercion and punishment in order for the plans to be somewhat effectively implemented. This, in combination of the failures of the central planning, slowly leads socialism down the road to an oppressive dictatorship.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Hayek\n| first = Friedrich\n| authorlink = Friedrich Hayek\n| title = [[The Road to Serfdom]]\n| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]\n| edition = 50th anniversary\n| date = 1994\n| isbn =  0-226-32061-8}}</ref> [[John Jewkes]], at the same time, made a similar analysis in ''Ordeal by planning''.\n-->\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n=== Efficiency of markets ===\nOne criticism is that the claim that a free market is efficient at resource allocation is incorrect.

The Case Against Markets. ''Journal of Economic Issues''. Vol. XLI, No. 4.</ref>\n\n[[Milton Friedman]] agreed that markets with monopolistic competition are not efficient, but argued that in countries with [[free trade]], the pressure from foreign competition would make monopolies behave in a competitive manner.<ref>''Free to Choose'', Milton Friedman, 1979, Secker and Warburg</ref> In countries with protectionist policies, foreign competition cannot fulfill this role but the threat of potential competition \u2014 that, were companies to abuse their position, new rivals could emerge and gain customers dissatisfied with the old companies \u2014 can still reduce the inefficiencies.\n\nOther libertarian capitalist analysts believe that monopolies and big business are not generally the result of a free market. Rather they say that such concentration is enabled by governmental grants of franchises or privileges.<ref>Murray N. Rothbard, [https://mises.org/daily/3735 \"Capitalism versus Statism,\"] in ''Outside Looking In: Critiques of American Policies and Institutions, Left and Right'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), pp. 60\u201374.</ref><ref>\"Toward a Theory of State Capitalism: Ultimate Decision-making and Class Structure\", ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Vol.1.

As any [[Universal Turing machine]] can do what any other Turing machine can, a central calculator in principle has no advantage over a system of dispersed calculators (i.e., a market), or vice versa.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Cottrell\n| first = Allin\n| authorlink = Allin Cottrell\n|author2=Paul Cockshott |author3=Greg Michaelson\n | year = 2007\n| title = Is Economic Planning Hypercomputational?

The market socialists pointed out the formal similarity between the neoclassical model of Walrasian general equilibrium and that of market socialism. Simply replace the Walrasian auctioneer with a planning board. However, this emphasizes the shortcomings of the model. According to Lavoie, the market socialists, by relying on this formal similarity must adopt the simplifying assumptions of the model. The model assumes that various sorts of information are \"given\" to the auctioneer or planning board. But without a capital market this information does not exist, and if it does exist, it exists in a fundamentally distributed form, unavailable to the planners. If the planners somehow captured this information, it would immediately become stale and relatively useless, unless reality somehow imitated the changeless monotony of the equilibrium model. The existence and usability of this information depends on its creation and situation within a distributed discovery procedure.\n\n===Scale of problem===\nOne criticism is that proponents of the theory overstate the strength of their case by describing socialism as impossible rather than inefficient.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Boettke\n| first = Peter J.\n| authorlink = Peter J.

Darwin was a founding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], a discussion group of pioneering industrialists and natural philosophers.\n\nHe turned down an invitation of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s to become a [[physician to the King]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Darwin cutout.png|thumb|upright|Stone-cast bust of Erasmus Darwin, by [[W. J. Coffee]], c. 1795]]\n[[File:Erasmus Darwin House.jpg|thumb|right|Darwin's House in Lichfield, now a museum dedicated to his life and work.]]\nDarwin was born in 1731 at [[Elston]] Hall, [[Nottinghamshire]] near [[Newark-on-Trent]], England, the youngest of seven children of [[Robert Darwin of Elston]] (12 August 1682 \u2013 20 November 1754), a lawyer and physician, and his wife Elizabeth Hill (1702&ndash;97). The name [[Erasmus (disambiguation)|Erasmus]] had been used by a number of his family and derives from his ancestor [[Erasmus Earle]], Common Sergent of England under [[Oliver Cromwell]].<ref>Burke's ''Landed Gentry'', Darwin ''formerly of'' Downe, 1966</ref> His siblings were: \n* [[Robert Waring Darwin of Elston|Robert Darwin]] (17 October 1724 \u2013 4 November 1816)\n* Elizabeth Darwin (15 September 1725 \u2013 8 April 1800)\n* William Alvey Darwin (3 October 1726 \u2013 7 October 1783)\n* Anne Darwin (12 November 1727 \u2013 3 August 1813)\n* Susannah Darwin (10 April 1729 \u2013 29 September 1789)\n* Charles Darwin, rector of Elston (28 September 1730 \u2013 24 May 1805)\n\nHe was educated at [[Chesterfield]] Grammar School, then later at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=DRWN750E|name=Darwin, Erasmus}}</ref> He obtained his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]]. Whether Darwin ever obtained the formal degree of MD is not known. Darwin settled in 1756 as a physician at Nottingham, but met with little success and so moved the following year to [[Lichfield]] to try to establish a practice there. A few weeks after his arrival, using a novel course of treatment, he restored the health of a young man whose death seemed inevitable. This ensured his success in the new locale. Darwin was a highly successful physician for more than fifty years in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] invited him to be [[Physician to the King|Royal Physician]], but Darwin declined. In [[Lichfield]], Darwin wrote \"didactic poetry, developed his system of evolution, and invented amongst other things, a carriage steering mechanism, a manuscript copier and a speaking machine.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Erasmus Darwin, after Joseph Wright.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Wright of Derby]], ''Erasmus Darwin'' (1770; [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]]).]]Darwin married twice and had 14 children, including two illegitimate daughters by an employee, and, possibly, at least one further illegitimate daughter.\n\nIn 1757 he married Mary (Polly) Howard (1740&ndash;1770). They had four sons and one daughter, two of whom (a son and a daughter) died in infancy:\n\n* [[Charles Darwin (medical student)|Charles Darwin]] (1758&ndash;1778)\n* Erasmus Darwin II (1759&ndash;1799)\n* Elizabeth Darwin (1763, survived 4 months)\n* [[Robert Darwin|Robert Waring Darwin]] (1766&ndash;1848), father of the naturalist Charles Darwin\n* William Alvey Darwin (1767, survived 19 days)\n\nThe first Mrs. Darwin died in 1770. A [[governess]], Mary Parker, was hired to look after Robert. By late 1771, employer and employee had become intimately involved and together they had two illegitimate daughters:\n* Susanna Parker (1772&ndash;1856)\n* Mary Parker Jr (1774&ndash;1859)\n\nSusanna and Mary Jr later established a [[boarding school]] for girls. In 1782, Mary Sr (the governess) married Joseph Day (1745&ndash;1811), a Birmingham merchant, and moved away.\n\nDarwin may have fathered another child, this time with a married woman. A Lucy Swift gave birth in 1771 to a baby, also named Lucy, who was christened a daughter of her mother and William Swift, but there is reason to believe the father was really Darwin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/namedef-2106|title=Darwin Correspondence Project|publisher=}}</ref> Lucy Jr. married John Hardcastle in [[Derby]] in 1792 and their daughter, Mary, married [[Francis Boott]], the physician.\n\nIn 1775 Darwin met Elizabeth Pole, daughter of [[Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore]], and wife of Colonel [[Edward Pole (Colonel)|Edward Pole]] (1718&ndash;1780); but as she was married, Darwin could only make his feelings known for her through poetry. When Edward Pole died, Darwin married Elizabeth and moved to her home, [[Radbourne Hall]], four miles (6&nbsp;km) west of Derby. The hall and village are these days known as [[Radbourne]]. In 1782, they moved to Full Street, Derby. They had four sons, one of whom died in infancy, and three daughters:<!-- I don't understand this, other sources say Breadsall Priory-->\n\n* Edward Darwin (1782&ndash;1829)\n* Frances Ann Violetta Darwin (1783&ndash;1874), married [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], was the mother of [[Francis Galton]]\n* Emma Georgina Elizabeth Darwin (1784&ndash;1818)\n* Sir [[Francis Sacheverel Darwin]] (1786&ndash;1859)\n* John Darwin (1787&ndash;1818)\n* Henry Darwin (1789&ndash;1790), died in infancy.\n* Harriet Darwin (1790&ndash;1825), married Admiral [[Thomas James Maling]]\n\nDarwin's personal appearance is described in unflattering detail in his Biographical Memoirs, printed by the Monthly Magazine in 1802. Darwin, the description reads, \"was of middle stature, in person gross and corpulent; his features were coarse, and his countenance heavy; if not wholly void of animation, it certainly was by no means expressive. The print of him, from a painting of Mr. Wright, is a good likeness. In his gait and dress he was rather clumsy and slovenly, and frequently walked with his tongue hanging out of his mouth.\"\n\n== Death ==\nDarwin died suddenly on 18 April 1802, weeks after having moved to [[Breadsall Priory]], just north of [[Derby]]. The Monthly Magazine of 1802, in its Biographical Memoirs of the Late Dr. Darwin, reports that \"during the last few years, Dr. Darwin was much subject to inflammation in his breast and lungs; he had a very serious attack of this disease in the course of the last Spring, from which, after repeated bleedings, by himself and a surgeon, he with great difficulty recovered.\"\n\nDarwin's death, the Biographical Memoirs continues, \"is variously accounted for: it is supposed to have been caused by the cold fit of an inflammatory fever. Dr. Fox, of Derby, considers the disease which occasioned it to have been angina pectoris; but Dr. Garlicke, of the same place, thinks this opinion not sufficiently well founded. Whatever was the disease, it is not improbable, surely, that the fatal event was hastened by the violent fit of passion with which he was seized in the morning.\"\n\nHis body is buried in All Saints Church, Breadsall.\n\nErasmus Darwin is commemorated on one of the [[Lunar Society Moonstones|Moonstones]], a series of monuments in [[Birmingham]].\n\n== Writings ==\n\n=== Botanical works and the Lichfield Botanical Society ===\nDarwin formed the Lichfield Botanical Society (despite the name, composed of only three men, Erasmus Darwin, [[Sir Brooke Boothby]] and Mr John Jackson, [[proctor]] of [[Lichfield Cathedral]]<ref group=notes>fl.&nbsp;1740s\u20131790s. Also Bookseller and Printer in Lichfield. When Darwin left Lichfield in 1781, Jackson took over his botanical garden. {{harv|Desmond|1994|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=thmPzIltAV8C&pg=PA377 Jackson, John p.&nbsp;377]}} {{harv|Seward|1804|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2fQ0AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA70 p.&nbsp;70]}} His daughter, Miss Mary A(nn) Jackson of Lichfield {{harv|Britten|Boulger|1889|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9lCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA180 p.&nbsp;180]}} (fl. 1830s\u20131840s), was a botanical illustrator, {{harv|Desmond|1994|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=thmPzIltAV8C&pg=PA377 Jackson, Mary Ann p.&nbsp;377]}} and author of ''Botanical Terms illustrated'' (1842) and ''Pictorial Flora'' (1840)</ref>){{sfn|Uglow|2002a}}{{sfn|Uglow|2002b}} to translate the works of the Swedish botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] from Latin into English. This took seven years. The result was two publications: ''A System of Vegetables'' between 1783 and 1785, and ''The Families of Plants'' in 1787. In these volumes, Darwin coined many of the English names of plants that we use today.{{sfn|George|2014}}\n\nDarwin then wrote ''[[The Loves of the Plants]],'' a long poem, which was a popular rendering of Linnaeus'  works. Darwin also wrote ''[[Economy of Vegetation]]'', and together the two were published as ''[[The Botanic Garden]]''. Among other writers he influenced were [[Anna Seward]] and [[Maria Jacson]].\n\n=== Zoonomia ===\nDarwin's most important scientific work, ''[[Zoonomia]]'' (1794&ndash;1796), contains a system of [[pathology]] and a chapter on '[[Generation]]'. In the latter, he anticipated some of the views of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], which foreshadowed the modern theory of [[evolution]]. Erasmus Darwin's works were read and commented on by his grandson [[Charles Darwin]] the naturalist. Erasmus Darwin based his theories on [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s psychological theory of [[associationism]].<ref>Allen, Richard C. 1999. ''David Hartley on human nature.'' Albany, N.Y.: [[SUNY Press]]. {{ISBN|0-7914-4233-0}}</ref> The essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:\n\n<blockquote>Would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which <small>THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE</small> endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!<ref name=\"Zoonomia\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15707/15707-h/15707-h.htm#sect_XXXIX Erasmus Darwin, ''Zoonomia'': Project Gutenberg text XXIX.4.8]</ref> </blockquote>\n\nErasmus Darwin also anticipated survival of the fittest in ''Zo\u00f6nomia'' mainly when writing about the \"three great objects of desire\" for every organism: \"lust, hunger, and security.\"<ref name=\"Zoonomia\"/>  A similar \"survival of the fittest\" view in ''Zo\u00f6nomia'' is Erasmus' view on how a species \"should\" propagate itself. Erasmus' idea that \"the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become improved\".<ref name=\"Zoonomia\"/>  Today, this is called the theory of [[survival of the fittest]].  His grandson Charles Darwin, much less libidinous and who led more of an invalid life, and who is not known to have illegitimately fathered children, or fathered children he did not plan, acknowledge and raise, posited the different and fuller theory of natural selection. Charles' theory was that natural selection is the inheritance of changed genetic characteristics that are better adaptations to the environment; these are not necessarily based in \"strength\" and \"activity\", which themselves ironically can lead to the overpopulation that results in natural selection yielding nonsurvivors of genetic traits.\n\nErasmus Darwin was familiar with the earlier proto-evolutionary thinking of [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]], and cited him in his 1803 work ''Temple of Nature.''\n\n=== Poem on evolution ===\nErasmus Darwin offered the first glimpse of his theory of evolution, obliquely, in a question at the end of a long footnote to his popular poem ''The Loves of the Plants'' (1789), which was republished throughout the 1790s in several editions as ''[[The Botanic Garden]]''. His poetic concept was to anthropomorphise the stamen (male) and pistil (female) sexual organs, as bride and groom. In this stanza on the flower Curcuma (also Flax and Turmeric) the \"youths\" are infertile, and he devotes the footnote to other examples of neutered organs in flowers, insect castes, and finally associates this more broadly with many popular and well-known cases of vestigial organs (male nipples, the third and fourth wings of flies, etc.)\n\n<blockquote>\nWoo'd with long care, CURCUMA cold and shy<br />\nMeets her fond husband with averted eye:<br />\n''Four'' beardless youths the obdurate beauty move<br />\nWith soft attentions of Platonic love.\n</blockquote>\n\nDarwin's final long poem, ''The Temple of Nature'' was published posthumously in 1803.  The poem was originally titled ''The Origin of Society''.  It is considered his best poetic work. It centres on his own conception of [[evolution]]. The poem traces the progression of life from micro-organisms to civilised society. The poem contains a passage that describes the [[struggle for existence]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71\u2013123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}</ref>\n\nHis poetry was admired by [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]], although [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] was intensely critical, writing, \"I absolutely nauseate Darwin's poem\".{{sfn|Uglow|2002b}}\nIt often made reference to his interests in science; for example botany and [[steam engine]]s.\n\n=== Education of women ===\nThe last two leaves of Darwin's ''A plan for the conduct of female education in boarding schools'' (1797) contain a book list, an apology for the work, and an advert for \"Miss Parkers School\". The work probably resulted from his liaison with Mary Parker. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\nThe school advertised on the last page is the one he set up in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire]] for their two illegitimate children, Susanna and Mary.\n\nDarwin regretted that a good education had not been generally available to women in Britain in his time, and drew on the ideas of [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Rousseau]], and [[St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9 du Crest de Saint-Aubin|Genlis]] in organising his thoughts. Addressing the education of middle class girls, Darwin argued that amorous romance novels were inappropriate and that they should seek simplicity in dress. He contends that young women should be educated in schools, rather than privately at home, and learn appropriate subjects. These subjects include physiognomy, physical exercise, botany, chemistry, mineralogy, and [[experimental philosophy]]. They should familiarise themselves with arts and manufactures through visits to sites like [[Coalbrookdale]], and Wedgwood's potteries; they should learn how to handle money, and study modern languages. Darwin's educational philosophy took the view that men and women should have different, capabilities, skills, spheres, and interests, where the woman's education was designed to support and serve male agency, accomplishment and financial reward and relieve him from daily responsibility for children and chores of life.<ref>[[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]] entry for Erasmus Darwin. Oxford.</ref> In the context of the times, this program may be read as a modernising influence in the sense that the woman was at least to learn about the \"man's world\", although not be allowed to participate in it. However, the text was written seven years after [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]] by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], which has the central argument that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society.\n\nSome women of Darwin's era were receiving more substantial educations and participating in the broader world.  An example is [[Susanna Wright]], who was raised in Lancashire and became an American colonist associated with the Midlands Enlightenment. It is not known whether Darwin and Wright knew each other, although they definitely knew many people in common.  Other women who received substantial educations and who participated in the broader world albeit sometimes anonymously, whom Darwin definitely knew, were [[Maria Jacson]] and [[Anna Seward]].\n\n== Lunar Society ==\nThe [[Lunar Society]]: these dates indicate the year in which Darwin became friends with these people, who, in turn, became members of the Lunar Society. The Lunar Society existed from 1765 to 1813.\n\nBefore 1765:\n* [[Matthew Boulton]], originally a buckle maker in Birmingham\n* [[John Whitehurst]] of Derby, maker of clocks and scientific instruments, pioneer of geology\nAfter 1765:\n* [[Josiah Wedgwood]], potter 1765\n* Dr. [[William Small]], 1765, man of science, formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy at the [[College of William and Mary]], where [[Thomas Jefferson]] was an appreciative pupil\n* [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], 1766, inventor\n* [[James Watt]], 1767, improver of steam engine\n* [[James Keir]], 1767, pioneer of the chemical industry\n* [[Thomas Day]], 1768, eccentric and author\n* Dr. [[William Withering]], 1775, the death of Dr. Small left an opening for a physician in the group.\n* [[Joseph Priestley]], 1780, experimental chemist and discoverer of many substances.\n* [[Samuel Galton, Jr.|Samuel Galton]], 1782, a Quaker gunmaker with a taste for science, took Darwin's place after Darwin moved to Derby.\n\nDarwin also established a lifelong friendship with [[Benjamin Franklin]], who shared Darwin's support for the American and French revolutions. The Lunar Society was instrumental as an intellectual driving force behind England's [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe members of the Lunar Society, and especially Darwin, [[abolitionism|opposed the slave trade]]. He attacked it in ''The Botanic Garden'' (1789&ndash;1791), and in ''The Loves of Plants'' (1789), ''The Economy of Vegetation'' (1791), and the ''Phytologia'' (1800).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Erasmus|title=Phytologia, or the philosophy of agriculture and gardening|date=1800|publisher=J. Johnson|location=London|page=77|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n== Other activities ==\nIn addition to the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin belonged to the influential [[Derby Philosophical Society]], as did his brother-in-law Samuel Fox (see family tree below). He experimented with the use of air and gases to alleviate infections and cancers in patients. A Pneumatic Institution was established at [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in 1799 for clinically testing these ideas. He conducted research into the formation of clouds, on which he published in 1788. He also inspired [[Robert Weldon]]'s [[Somerset Coal Canal]] [[caisson lock]].\n\n[[Mary Shelley]] in her introduction to the 1831 edition of [[Frankenstein]] notes that some unspecified \"experiments of Dr. Darwin\" were part of the evening discussion topics leading up to her inspiration and creation of her novel.<ref>Shelley, Mary. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42324/42324-h/42324-h.htm \"Introduction\" ''Frankenstein'' (1831 edition)] Gutenberg<br>\"Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. ...

However Erasmus Darwin had speculated on these sorts of events in ''The Botanic Garden, A Poem in Two Parts: Part 1, The Economy of Vegetation, 1791:''<ref>{{cite book|title=A Thousand and One Gems of English Poetry|editor=Charles Mackay|date=1896|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Roll on, ye Stars! exult in youthful prime,<br />Mark with bright curves the printless steps of Time;<br />Near and more near your beamy cars approach,<br />And lessening orbs on lessening orbs encroach; \u2014<br />Flowers of the sky! ye too to age must yield,<br />Frail as your silken sisters of the field.<br />Star after star from Heaven's high arch shall rush,<br />Suns sink on suns, and systems, systems crush,<br />Headlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall,<br />And death and night and chaos mingle all:<br />\u2014 Till o'er the wreck, emerging from the storm,<br />Immortal Nature lifts her changeful form,<br />Mounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame,<br />And soars and shines, another and the same!''</blockquote>\n\n=== Inventions ===\nDarwin was the inventor of several devices, though he did not patent any.  He believed this would damage his reputation as a doctor, and encouraged his friends to patent their own modifications of his designs.{{sfn|Smith|2005}}\n* A horizontal [[windmill]], which he designed for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] (who would be Charles Darwin's other grandfather, see family tree below).\n* A [[carriage]] that would not tip over (1766).\n* A steering mechanism for his [[carriage]], known today as the [[Ackermann linkage]], that would be adopted by cars 130 years later (1759).{{sfn|Smith|2005}}\n* A speaking machine, which was a mechanical larynx made of wood, silk, and leather and pronounced several sounds so well \u2018as to deceive all who heard it unseen\u2019(at [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in 1799).<ref name=\"EDH\">{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmusdarwin.org/2013/01/project-update-the-speaking-machine/|title=Project Update: The Speaking Machine|last=|first=|date=9 January 2013|website=Erasmus Darwin House|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324115010/http://www.erasmusdarwin.org/2013/01/project-update-the-speaking-machine/|archive-date=24 March 2015|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* A [[boat lift|canal lift]] for barges.\n* A minute artificial bird.{{sfn|Smith|2005}}\n* A [[copying]] machine (1778).\n* A variety of weather monitoring machines.\n\n=== Rocket engine ===\nIn notes dating to 1779, Darwin made a sketch of a simple hydrogen-oxygen [[rocket engine]], with gas tanks connected by plumbing and pumps to an elongated combustion chamber and expansion nozzle, a concept not to be seen again until one century later.\n\n== Major publications ==\n* Erasmus Darwin, ''A Botanical Society at Lichfield.

This inspired the establishment of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070815213429/http://www.infection.bham.ac.uk/BPAG/Dub/dub.html Genomic Dub Collective], whose album includes quotations from Erasmus \"Ras\" Darwin, his grandson [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Haile Selassie]].\n* The forgetting of Erasmus' designs for a rocket is a major plot point in [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s tale of alternate universes, ''Manifold: Origin''.\n* Phrases from Darwin's poem [[The Botanic Garden]] are used as chapter headings in ''The Pornographer of Vienna'' by [[Lewis Crofts]].\n* British poet [[J.H. Prynne]] took on the pseudonym Erasmus W. Darwin for his \"plant time\" bulletins in the pages of ''Bean News'' (1972).\n* A building on the Nottingham Trent University Clifton Campus is named after him. It is the centre for science teaching, academic offices and study space.\n* Erasmus Darwin appears as a character in [[Sergey Lukyanenko]]'s novel ''[[New Watch (novel)|New Watch]]'' as a Dark Other and a prophet living in [[Regent's Park Estate]].\n\n==Surviving houses==\n[[Erasmus Darwin House]], his home in [[Lichfield]], is now a museum dedicated to Erasmus Darwin and his life's work.

Rather, the beginning is defined at the base of a chemically distinctive [[carbonate]] layer that is referred to as a \"[[cap carbonate]],\" because it caps glacial deposits.\n\nThis bed is characterized by an unusual depletion of <sup>13</sup>[[Carbon|C]] that indicates a sudden climatic change at the end of the [[Marinoan]] [[ice age]]. The lower boundary [[GSSP]] of the Ediacaran is at the base of the cap carbonate (Nuccaleena Formation), immediately above the Elatina [[diamictite]] in the Enorama Creek section, Brachina Gorge, Flinders Ranges, South Australia.\n\nThe [[GSSP]] of the upper boundary of the Ediacaran is the lower boundary of the Cambrian on the SE coast of Newfoundland approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the [[Tommotian]] Stage in [[Siberia]] which was selected on the basis of the ichnofossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' (Seilacher, 1955). In the history of stratigraphy it was the first case of usage of bioturbations for the System boundary definition.\n\nNevertheless, the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the Ediacaran on the basis of chemostratigraphy and [[ichnofossil]]s are disputable.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/><ref name=Comments2004>Comments By B.

The exact definition of existence is one of the most important and fundamental topics of [[ontology]], the philosophical study of the nature of [[being]], existence, or reality in general, as well as of the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology deals with questions concerning what things or [[Entity|entities]] exist or can be said to exist, and how such things or entities can be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.\n\n[[Materialism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[matter]] and [[energy]], that all things are composed of material, that all actions require energy, and that all phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of material interactions.\n\n[[Rationalism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[thoughts]] and [[ideas]],{{cn|date=August 2018}} that all things are composed of strings of reasoning, that all thing(s) require an associated idea of the thing(s), and that all the phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of an understanding of the imprint from the noumenal world in which lies beyond the thing-in-itself.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"existence\" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''exsistere'' meaning \"to appear\", \"to arise\", \"to become\", or \"to be\", but literally, it means \"to stand out\" (''ex-'' being the Latin prefix for \"out\" added to the causative of the verb ''stare'', meaning \"to stand\").<ref>{{OEtymD|existence}}</ref> In a technical sense, this refers to ''standing out'' of both [[being]] and [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], thus having the qualities of both.<ref>{{OEtymD|existence}}</ref>\n\n== Historical conceptions ==\n{{See also|Avicennism|Scholasticism}}\nIn the [[Western world|Western]] tradition of philosophy, the earliest known comprehensive treatments of the subject are from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', though earlier fragmentary writing exists. Aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being, according to which only individual things, called substances, fully have to be, but other things such as relations, quantity, time, and place (called the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]) have a derivative kind of being, dependent on individual things. In Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'', there are [[four causes]] of existence or change in nature: the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause and the final cause.\n\nThe [[Neo-Platonist]]s and some early [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except in the mind of God.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Some taught that existence was a snare and a delusion, that the world, the flesh, and the devil existed only to tempt weak humankind away from God.\n\nThe [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that God is pure being, and that in God [[essence]] and existence are the same.<ref>{{cite book | last = Marenbon| first = John| authorlink = | title = Medieval Philosophy: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction| publisher = Routledge| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2006| location = | pages = 239| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veGCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239#v=onepage&q&f=false| doi = | id = | isbn = 9781134461837| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref> At about the same time, the [[nominalist]] philosopher [[William of Ockham]] argued, in Book I of his ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Totius Logicae]]'' (''Treatise on all Logic'', written some time before 1327), that Categories are not a form of Being in their own right, but derivative on the existence of individuals.\n\n===Early modern philosophy===\nThe [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] treatment of the subject derives from [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic'', or ''The Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'', first published in 1662. Arnauld thought that a [[proposition]] or [[Decision making|judgment]] consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them:\n\n{{quote|text=After conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas and, finding that some belong together and others do not, we unite or separate them. This is called affirming or denying, and in general judging.\n\nThis judgment is also called a proposition, and it is easy to see that it must have two terms. One term, of which one affirms or denies something, is called the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]; the other term, which is affirmed or denied, is called the attribute or [[predicate (logic)|Praedicatum]].|sign=Antoine Arnauld|source=''The Art of Thinking'' (''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''), 1662, translated by J. Buroker in 1996, Logic, II.3, p. 82}}\n\nThe two terms are joined by the verb \"is\" (or \"is not\", if the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus every proposition has three components: the two terms, and the \"[[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]\" that connects or separates them. Even when the proposition has only two words, the three terms are still there. For example, \"God loves humanity\", really means \"God is a lover of humanity\", \"God exists\" means \"God is a thing\".\n\nThis theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries, but it has some obvious difficulties: it only considers proposition of the form \"All A are B.\", a form logicians call [[universal quantifier|universal]]. It does not allow propositions of the form \"Some A are B\", a form logicians call [[existential quantifier|existential]]. If neither A nor B includes the idea of existence, then \"some A are B\" simply adjoins A to B. Conversely, if A or B do include the idea of existence in the way that \"triangle\" contains the idea \"three angles equal to two right angles\", then \"A exists\" is automatically true, and we have an [[ontological proof]] of A's existence. (Indeed, Arnauld's contemporary [[Descartes]] famously argued so, regarding the concept \"God\" (discourse 4, Meditation 5)). Arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[David Hume]] argued that the claim that a thing exists, when added to our notion of a thing, does not add anything to the concept. For example, if we form a complete notion of Moses, and superadd to that notion the claim that Moses existed, we are not adding anything to the notion of Moses.\n\n[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also argued that existence is not a \"real\" predicate, but gave no explanation of how this is possible. Indeed, his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of Arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition \"God is omnipotent\", the verb \"is\" signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as \"God\" and \"omnipotence\".{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] claimed that \u201ceverything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, only object in relation to the subject, the perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.\u201d<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, \u00a7 1</ref> According to him there can be \"No object without subject\" because \"everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing, and presupposes these forms&hellip;\"<ref name=\"reference\">''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, \u00a7 7</ref>\n\n==Predicative nature==\n[[John Stuart Mill]] (and also Kant's pupil [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like \"A [[centaur]] is a [[poetic fiction]]\"<ref>[[John Stuart Mill]], ''[[A System of Logic]]'', 1843 I. iv. 1.page 124</ref> or \"A [[greatest number]] is impossible\" (Herbart).<ref>''Uberweg'' (System of Logic) \u00a768</ref> [[Franz Brentano]] challenged this; so also (as is better known) did [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase \"an A\" to the concept represented by an adjective \"B\" to give the concept represented by the noun phrase \"a B-A\". For example, we can join \"a man\" to \"wise\" to give \"a wise man\". But the noun phrase \"a wise man\" is not a sentence, whereas \"some man is wise\" is a sentence. Hence the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] must do more than merely join or separate concepts. Furthermore, adding \"exists\" to \"a wise man\", to give the complete sentence \"a wise man exists\" has the same effect as joining \"some man\" to \"wise\" using the copula. So the copula has the same effect as \"exists\". Brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the \"exists\" and \"does not exist\" of the existential proposition take the place of the copula. He showed this by the following examples:\n\n: The categorical proposition \"Some man is sick\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A sick man exists\" or \"There is a sick man.\"\n\n: The categorical proposition \"No stone is living\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A living stone does not exist\" or \"there is no living stone\".\n\n: The categorical proposition \"All men are mortal\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"An immortal man does not exist\" or \"there is no immortal man\".\n\n: The categorical proposition \"Some man is not learned\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A non-learned man exists\" or \"there is a non-learned man\".\n\nFrege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', as did [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (but Peirce held that [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics|the possible and the real are not limited to the actual, individually existent]]). The Frege-Brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in [[Analytic philosophy|modern Anglo-American philosophy]]: that existence is asserted by the [[existential quantifier]] (as expressed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s slogan \"To be is to be the value of a variable.\" \u2014 ''On What There Is'', 1948).<ref>''On What There Is'' \u2013 in Review of Metaphysics (1948). Reprinted in [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Harvard University Press, 1953)</ref>\n\n===Semantics===\nIn [[mathematical logic]], there are two quantifiers, \"some\" and \"all\", though as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1838\u20131917) pointed out, we can make do with just one quantifier and negation. The first of these quantifiers, \"some\", is also expressed as \"there exists\". Thus, in the sentence \"There exists a man\", the term \"man\" is asserted to be part of existence. But we can also assert, \"There exists a triangle.\" Is a \"triangle\" \u2014 an abstract idea \u2014 part of existence in the same way that a \"man\" \u2014 a physical body \u2014 is part of existence? Do abstractions such as goodness, blindness, and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs, tables, and houses exist? What [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], or kinds of thing, can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition?\n\nWorse, does \"existence\" exist?<ref>''To exist is to have a specific relation to existence \u2013 a relation, by the way, which existence itself does not have''. [[Bertrand Russell]] \u2013 ''The Principles of Mathematics'' \u2013 New York, W. W. Norton & Company, 1903, second edition 1937 pages 449\u2013450.</ref>\n\nIn some statements, existence is implied without being mentioned. The statement \"A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith\" cannot just be about a bridge, the Thames, and Hammersmith. It must be about \"existence\" as well. On the other hand, the statement \"A bridge crosses the Styx at Limbo\" has the same form, but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick, what \"existence\" would mean in the second case is less clear.\n\nThe [[nominalist]] approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be \"eliminated\" by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning but does not contain the noun phrase. Thus [[William of Ockham|Ockham]] argued that \"Socrates has wisdom\", which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for \"wisdom\", can be rewritten as \"Socrates is wise\", which contains only the referring phrase \"Socrates\".<ref>Klima, G., ''John Buridan'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=7A_iBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT146#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 146]</ref> This method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic school]] of philosophy.\n\nHowever, this argument may be inverted by [[Philosophical realism|realists]] in arguing that since the sentence \"Socrates is wise\" can be rewritten as \"Socrates has wisdom\", this proves the existence of a hidden referent for \"wise\".\n\nA further problem is that human beings seem to process information about [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] in much the same way that they process information about real people. For example, in the [[2008 United States presidential election]], a politician and actor named [[Fred Thompson]] ran for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination. In polls, potential voters identified Fred Thompson as a \"law and order\" candidate. Thompson plays a fictional character on the television series ''[[Law & Order franchise|Law and Order]]''. The people who make the comment are aware that ''Law and Order'' is fiction, but at some level, they may process fiction as if it were fact, a process included in what is called the Paradox of Fiction{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/</ref> Another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play.\n\nA scientist might make a clear distinction between objects that exist, and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy. But in the layperson's [[worldview]], existence includes real, fictional, and even contradictory objects. Thus if we reason from the statement \"[[Pegasus]] flies\" to the statement \"Pegasus exists\", we are not asserting that Pegasus is made up of atoms, but rather that Pegasus exists in the worldview of classical myth. When a mathematician reasons from the statement \"ABC is a triangle\" to the statement \"triangles exist\", she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular [[mathematical model]].\n\n==Modern approaches==\nAccording to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Descriptions]], the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope: we distinguish between \"some S is not P\" (where negation takes \"narrow scope\") and \"it is not the case that 'some S is P'\" (where negation takes \"wide scope\"). The problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names. The sentences \"Socrates is not bald\" and \"it is not the case that Socrates is bald\" both appear to have the same meaning, and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (Socrates) who is not bald, so that negation takes a narrow scope. However, Russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem. According to Russell, Socrates can be analyzed into the form 'The Philosopher of Greece.' In the wide scope, this would then read: It is not the case that there existed a philosopher of Greece who was bald. In the narrow scope, it would read the Philosopher of Greece was not bald.\n\nAccording to the [[Direct reference|direct-reference]] view, an early version of which was originally proposed by [[Bertrand Russell]], and perhaps earlier by [[Gottlob Frege]], a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers. This view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us ''which'' object bears the name, and thus to identify some object. But no object can be identified if none exists. Thus, a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful.\n\n===Existence in the wide and narrow senses===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nAccording to the \"two sense\" view of existence, which derives from [[Alexius Meinong]], existential statements fall into two classes.\n\n# Those asserting existence in a ''wide'' sense. These are typical of the form \"N is P\" for singular N, or \"some S is P\".\n# Those asserting existence in a ''narrow'' sense. These are typical of the form \"N exists\" or \"Ss exist\".\n\nThe problem is then evaded as follows. \"Pegasus flies\" implies existence in the wide sense, for it implies that ''something'' flies. But it does not imply existence in the narrow sense, for we deny existence in this sense by saying that Pegasus does not exist. In effect, the world of all things divides, on this view, into those (like [[Socrates]], the planet [[Venus]], and New York City) that have existed in the narrow sense, and those (like [[Sherlock Holmes]], the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Minas Tirith]]) that do not.\n\nHowever, common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] or places.\n\n=== European views ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nInfluenced by the views of Brentano's pupil [[Alexius Meinong]], and by [[Edmund Husserl]], Germanophone and Francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence.\n\n===Anti-realist arguments===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[Anti-realism]] is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world, maintaining either: (1) that nothing exists outside the [[mind]], or (2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist. Realists, in contrast, hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. An \"anti-realist\" who denies that other minds exist (i. e., a [[solipsist]]) is different from an \"anti-realist\" who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i. e., a logical [[behaviorist]]).\n\n== Dharmic \"middle way\" view ==\nThe Indian philosopher [[Nagarjuna#Philosophy|Nagarjuna]] (c. 150\u2013250 CE) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] Buddhism.\n\nIn Eastern philosophy, [[Anicca]] (Sanskrit ''anitya'') or \"[[impermanence]]\" describes existence. It refers to the fact that all conditioned things ([[sankhara]]) are in a constant state of flux. In reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist; only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another. Imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes. While the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases, the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants. Buddhism teaches a middle way, avoiding the extreme views of [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] and [[nihilism]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel186.html | title=The Three Basic Facts of Existence |accessdate=2009-07-14| last=The Buddhist Publication Society | quote=(ref.1) Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, \"this is lasting\"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird's melody, the bee's hum, and a sunset's glory.}}</ref> The middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist. The differences are reconciled in the concept of [[Shunyata]] by addressing the existing object's served purpose for the subject's identity in being. What exists is in non-existence, because the subject changes.\n\n[[Trailokya]] elaborates on three kinds of existence, those of desire, form, and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths. Taken further to the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, it describes how the Buddha exists. In this philosophy, it is accepted that Buddha exists in more than one absolute way.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''\n* [[Conservation law (physics)|Conservation law]]\n* [[Existence precedes essence]]\n* [[Existence theorem]]\n* [[Existential quantification]]\n* [[Existentialism]]\n* [[Solipsism]]\n* [[Three marks of existence]]\n* [[Universal quantification]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* [[Aristotle]], ''The Metaphysics'', translated by Hugh Lawson-Tancred, Penguin Classics, 1999, {{ISBN|0-14-044619-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044619-7}}\n* [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]] ''Logic, or the Art of Thinking'', (known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''), translated J.

It involves [[inflation]] rising as real [[gross domestic product]] rises and [[unemployment]] falls, as the economy moves along the [[Phillips curve]]. This is commonly described as \"''too much money chasing too few [[Good (economics)|goods]].''\"<ref>Barth, J. R. & Bennett, J. T. (1975). Cost-push versus Demand-pull Inflation: Some Empirical Evidence.  Journal of money, credit & banking (Ohio State University Press),7(3), 391.</ref> More accurately, it should be described as involving \"''too much money '''spent''' chasing too few goods,''\" since only money that is spent on goods and services can cause inflation. This would not be expected to happen, unless the economy is already at a [[full employment]] level. It is the opposite of [[cost-push inflation]].\n\n== How it happens ==\nIn [[Keynesian theory]], increased employment results in increased aggregate demand (AD), which leads to further hiring by firms to increase output. Due to capacity constraints, this increase in output will eventually become so small that the price of the good will rise.\nAt first, unemployment will go down, shifting AD1 to AD2, which increases demand (noted as \"Y\") by (Y2 \u2212 Y1). This increase in demand means more workers are needed, and then AD will be shifted from AD2 to AD3, but this time much less is produced than in the previous shift, but the price level has risen from P2 to P3, a much higher increase in price than in the previous shift. \nThis increase in price is called inflation.\n\nDemand-pull inflation is in contrast with [[cost-push inflation]], when price and wage increases are being transmitted from one sector to another. \nHowever, these can be considered as different aspects of an overall inflationary process: '''demand-pull inflation''' explains how price inflation starts, and cost-push inflation demonstrates why inflation once begun is so difficult to stop.<ref>http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095709229 OxfordIndex, A Dictionary of Economics</ref>\n\n== Causes<ref>{{Cite web|title = Causes of Inflation: Demand-Pull Inflation {{!}} Intelligent Economist|url = http://www.intelligenteconomist.com/causes-of-inflation-demand-pull-inflation/|website = Intelligent Economist|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}</ref> ==\n* There is a quick increase in consumption and investment along with extremely confident firms.\n* There is a sudden increase in exports due to huge under-valuation of the currency.\n* There is a lot of government spending.\n* The expectation that inflation will rise often leads to a rise in inflation.

It stands in contrast to [[demand-pull inflation]]. Both accounts of inflation have at various times been put forward with oftentimes inconclusive evidence as to which explanation is superior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=Paul A.|last2=Solow|first2=Robert M.|title=Analytical Aspects of Anti-Inflation Policy|date=1960|volume=50|issue=2|pages=177-194}}</ref> A situation that has been often cited of this was the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of the 1970s, which some economists see as a major cause of the inflation experienced in the [[Western world]] in that decade. It is argued that this inflation resulted from increases in the cost of [[petroleum]] imposed by the member states of [[OPEC]]. Since petroleum is so important to industrialized economies, a large increase in its price can lead to the increase in the price of most products, raising the [[price level]]. Some economists argue that such a change in the price level can raise the [[inflation rate]] over longer periods, due to [[adaptive expectations]] and the [[price/wage spiral]], so that a [[supply shock]] can have persistent effects. \n\n== See also ==\n*[[Stagflation]]\n*[[Demand-pull inflation]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Inflation]]", "sha1": "emura05v2yflk3jtmc9cbk3c7djwgg3"}}, {"title": "Extractor (mathematics)", "ns": "0", "id": "9309", "revision": {"id": "478974773", "parentid": "321430226", "timestamp": "2012-02-26T17:20:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rcsprinter123", "id": "12557839"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Repairing links to disambiguation pages - [[Wikipedia:DPL|You can help!]] using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "An <math>(N,M,D,K,\\epsilon)</math> -'''extractor''' is a [[bipartite graph]] with <math>N</math> nodes on the left and <math>M</math> nodes on the right such that each node on the left has <math>D</math> neighbors (on the right), which has the added property that\nfor any subset <math>A</math> of the left vertices of size at least <math>K</math>, the distribution on right vertices obtained by choosing a random node in <math>A</math> and then following a random [[graph theory|edge]] to get a node x on the right side is <math>\\epsilon</math>-close to the [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] in terms of [[total variation distance]].\n\nA [[disperser]] is a related graph. \n\nAn equivalent way to view an extractor is as a bivariate function \n\n:<math>E : [N] \\times [D] \\rightarrow [M]</math> \n\nin the natural way.

These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.\n\n'''Direct integration'''\u2014ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.\n\n'''Database integration'''\u2014ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.\n\n'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''\u2014These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system\u2013specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off\u2013the\u2013shelf solution.\n\n'''Custom\u2013integration solutions'''\u2014Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom\u2013integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.\n\n==Implementation==\nERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref> Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes\u2014consulting, customization, and support.<ref name=\"tech-faq.com\" /> Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project.

Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:\n* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy\n* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process\n* Understanding existing automated solutions<ref>King.

Davenport, \"Putting the Enterprise into the Enterprise System\", ''Harvard Business Review'', July\u2013August 1998.</ref>\n\nA potential disadvantage is that adopting \"standard\" processes can lead to a loss of [[competitive advantage]]. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.<ref>Turban et al. (2008).

ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting\u2014[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]\u2014to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.<ref name=\"Thomas H. Davenport 1998\"/>\n\n===Two tier enterprise resource planning===\n\nTwo-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company\u2019s customers. Each independent center or subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.\n\nGiven the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.<ref name=\"ferdows\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201388 }}</ref> With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model\u2014separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems.

Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization\u2014with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.<ref name=\"Fryling 2010 391\u2013421\">{{cite journal|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Estimating the impact of enterprise resource planning project management decisions on post-implementation maintenance costs: a case study using simulation modelling|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=391\u2013421|doi=10.1080/17517575.2010.519785|bibcode=2010EntIS...4..391F}}</ref> Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:\n\n* Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).\n* The software is designed to handle various configurations, and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.\n* The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.\n* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre\u2013defined \"hooks\" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting.

This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> to software implementation, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.\n\nThere is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.\n\nThe main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of ERP software packages]]\n* [[Accounting software]]\n* [[Bill of resources]]\n* [[Business process management]]\n* [[Business intelligence]]\n* [[Cost accounting]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Document automation]]\n* [[Data migration]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Enterprise feedback management]] (EFM)\n* [[Enterprise planning systems]]\n* [[Enterprise system]]\n* [[ERP modeling]]\n* [[ERP system selection methodology]]\n* [[Information technology management]]\n* [[List of project management software]]\n* [[Management information system]]\n* [[Manufacturing operations management]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Operations research]]\n* [[Service management]]\n* [[Software as a service]]\n* [[Visitor management|Visitor management systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric.

Hormones have many different functions and modes of action; one hormone may have several effects on different target organs, and, conversely, one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone.\n\n==The endocrine system==\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Examples of '''amine hormones'''\n| background color = white\n| image1 = Norepinephrine structure with descriptor.svg\n| width1 = 115\n| caption1 = [[Norepinephrine]]\n| image2 = (S)-Triiodthyronine Structural Formulae V2.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| caption2 = [[Triiodothyronine]]\n}}{{Main|Endocrine system}} Endocrinology is the study of the endocrine system in the human body. This is a system of [[gland]]s which secrete hormones. Hormones are chemicals which affect the actions of different organ systems in the body. Examples include [[thyroid hormone]], [[growth hormone]], and [[insulin]]. The endocrine system involves a number of feedback mechanisms, so that often one hormone (such as [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|thyroid stimulating hormone]]) will control the action or release of another secondary hormone (such as [[thyroid hormone]]). If there is too much of the secondary hormone, it may provide negative feedback to the primary hormone, maintaining [[homeostasis]].\n\nIn the original 1902 definition by Bayliss and Starling (see below), they specified that, to be classified as a hormone, a chemical must be produced by an organ, be released (in small amounts) into the blood, and be transported by the blood to a distant organ to exert its specific function. This definition holds for most \"classical\" hormones, but there are also [[paracrine]] mechanisms (chemical communication between cells within a tissue or organ), [[autocrine signaling|autocrine]] signals (a chemical that acts on the same cell), and [[intracrine]] signals (a chemical that acts within the same cell).<ref>{{cite book |author=Nussey S|author2=Whitehead S |title=Endocrinology: An Integrated Approach  |date=2001 |isbn=1-85996-252-1 |publisher=Bios Scientific Publ. |location=Oxford}}</ref> A [[neuroendocrine]] signal is a \"classical\" hormone that is released into the blood by a neurosecretory neuron (see article on [[neuroendocrinology]]).\n\n=== Hormones ===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Examples of '''steroid hormones'''\n| background color = white\n| image1 = Cortisol2.svg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = [[Cortisol]]\n| image2 = Cholecalciferol.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| caption2 = [[Cholecalciferol|Vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]]\n}}\nGriffin and Ojeda identify three different classes of hormones based on their chemical composition:<ref>{{cite book |author=Ojeda, Sergio R.|author2=Griffin, James Bennett |title=Textbook of endocrine physiology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |date=2000 |edition=4th |isbn=0-19-513541-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Amines====\nAmines, such as [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] ([[catecholamines]]), are derived from single [[amino acid]]s, in this case tyrosine. [[Thyroid]] hormones such as 3,5,3\u2019-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3\u2019,5\u2019-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T4) make up a subset of this class because they derive from the combination of two iodinated tyrosine amino acid residues.\n\n====Peptide and protein====\n[[Peptide hormones]] and protein hormones consist of three (in the case of [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]]) to more than 200 (in the case of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]]) amino acid residues and can have a molecular mass as large as 30,000 grams per mole. All hormones secreted by the pituitary gland are peptide hormones, as are [[leptin]] from adipocytes, [[ghrelin]] from the stomach, and [[insulin]] from the [[pancreas]].\n\n====Steroid====\n[[Steroid hormones]] are converted from their parent compound, [[cholesterol]]. [[Mammal]]ian steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups by the receptors to which they bind: [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[mineralocorticoid]]s, [[androgen]]s, [[estrogen]]s, and [[progestogen]]s. Some forms of [[vitamin D]], such as [[calcitriol]], are steroid-like and bind to homologous receptors, but lack the characteristic fused ring structure of true steroids.\n\n==As a profession==\n\n{{Infobox Occupation\n| name= Endocrinologist\n| image= \n| caption= manjoi\n| official_names= Doctor, Medical specialist\n<!------------Details------------------->\n| type= [[Specialty (medicine)|Specialty]]\n| activity_sector= [[Medicine]]\n| competencies= \n| formation= *[[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.)\n* [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.)\n* [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (M.B.B.S.)\n| employment_field= [[Hospital]]s, [[Clinic]]s\n| related_occupation= \n}}\n\nAlthough every organ system secretes and responds to hormones (including the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human lungs|lungs]], [[Human heart|heart]], [[intestine]], [[human skin|skin]], and the [[kidney]]), the clinical specialty of endocrinology focuses primarily on the ''endocrine organs'', meaning the organs whose primary function is hormone secretion.  These organs include the [[pituitary]], [[thyroid]], [[adrenal]]s, [[ovary|ovaries]], [[testes]], and  [[pancreas]].\n\nAn ''endocrinologist'' is a [[physician]] who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine system, such as [[diabetes]], [[hyperthyroidism]], and many others (see [[Endocrine disease|list of diseases]]).\n\n===Work===\nThe medical specialty of endocrinology involves the diagnostic evaluation of a wide variety of symptoms and variations and the long-term management of disorders of deficiency or excess of one or more hormones.\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of endocrine diseases are guided by [[laboratory]] tests to a greater extent than for most specialties. Many diseases are investigated through ''excitation/stimulation'' or ''inhibition/suppression'' testing. This might involve injection with a stimulating agent to test the function of an endocrine organ. Blood is then sampled to assess the changes of the relevant hormones or metabolites. An endocrinologist needs extensive knowledge of [[clinical chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] to understand the uses and limitations of the investigations.\n\nA second important aspect of the practice of endocrinology is distinguishing human variation from disease. Atypical patterns of physical development and abnormal test results must be assessed as indicative of disease or not. [[Diagnostic imaging]] of endocrine organs may reveal incidental findings called [[incidentaloma]]s, which may or may not represent disease.\n\nEndocrinology involves caring for the person as well as the disease. Most endocrine disorders are [[chronic disease]]s that need lifelong care. Some of the most common endocrine diseases include [[diabetes]] mellitus, [[hypothyroidism]] and the [[metabolic syndrome]]. Care of diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases necessitates understanding the patient at the personal and social level as well as the molecular, and the physician\u2013patient relationship can be an important therapeutic process.\n\nApart from treating patients, many endocrinologists are involved in [[clinical science]] and [[medical research]], [[teaching]], and [[hospital management]].\n\n===Training===\nEndocrinologists are specialists of [[internal medicine]] or [[pediatrics]]. Reproductive endocrinologists deal primarily with problems of [[fertility]] and menstrual function\u2014often training first in obstetrics. Most qualify as an [[internist]], [[pediatrician]], or [[gynecologist]] for a few years before specializing, depending on the local training system. In the U.S. and Canada, training for board certification in internal medicine, [[pediatrics]], or [[gynecology]] after medical school is called residency. Further formal training to subspecialize in adult, [[pediatric endocrinology|pediatric]], or reproductive endocrinology is called a fellowship. Typical training for a North American endocrinologist involves 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3 years of residency, and 2 years of fellowship. In the US, adult endocrinologists are board certified by the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine]] (AOBIM) in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism.\n\n== Diseases and medicine ==\n\n===Diseases===\n:See main article at ''[[Endocrine diseases]]''\nEndocrinology also involves study of the diseases of the endocrine system. These diseases may relate to too little or too much secretion of a hormone, too little or too much action of a hormone, or problems with receiving the hormone.\n\n=== Societies and organisations ===\nBecause endocrinology encompasses so many conditions and diseases, there are many organizations that provide education to patients and the public. [[The Hormone Foundation]] is the public education affiliate of [[The Endocrine Society]] and provides information on all endocrine-related conditions.

The solution was then used to bathe a non-innervated second heart. If the vagus nerve on the first heart was stimulated, negative [[inotropic]] (beat amplitude) and [[chronotropic]] (beat rate) activity were seen in both hearts. This did not occur in either heart if the vagus nerve was not stimulated. The vagus nerve was adding something to the saline solution. The effect could be blocked using [[atropine]], a known [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] to [[heart]] vagal nerve stimulation. Clearly, something was being secreted by the [[vagus nerve]] and affecting the heart. The \"vagusstuff\" (as Loewi called it) causing the myotropic (muscle enhancing) effects was later identified to be [[acetylcholine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Loewi won the Nobel Prize for his discovery.\n\nRecent work in endocrinology focuses on the molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering the effects of [[hormone]]s. The first example of such work being done was in 1962 by [[Earl Wilbur Sutherland Jr.|Earl Sutherland]]. Sutherland investigated whether hormones enter cells to evoke action, or stayed outside of cells. He studied [[norepinephrine]], which acts on the liver to convert [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]] via the activation of the [[phosphorylase]] enzyme. He homogenized the liver into a membrane fraction and soluble fraction (phosphorylase is soluble), added norepinephrine to the membrane fraction, extracted its soluble products, and added them to the first soluble fraction. Phosphorylase activated, indicating that norepinephrine's target receptor was on the cell membrane, not located intracellularly. He later identified the compound as cyclic AMP ([[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]) and with his discovery created the concept of second-messenger-mediated pathways. He, like Loewi, won the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work in endocrinology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sutherland EW |title=Studies on the mechanism of hormone action |journal=Science |volume=177 |issue=4047 |pages=401\u20138 |date=1972 |pmid=4339614 |doi= 10.1126/science.177.4047.401|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4339614|bibcode = 1972Sci...177..401S }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pediatric endocrinology]]\n*[[Neuroendocrinology]]\n*[[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility]]\n*[[Hormone]]\n*[[Hormone replacement therapy]]\n*[[Endocrine disease]]\n*[[Comparative endocrinology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Medicine}}\n{{endocrine system}}\n{{Endocrinology}}\n{{Endocrine pathology}}\n\n[[Category:Endocrine system]]\n[[Category:Endocrinology| ]]", "sha1": "0cebmuqg94fgcqyd7ymttqkgo6m03ad"}}, {"title": "Endocrine system", "ns": "0", "id": "9312", "revision": {"id": "866487685", "parentid": "866408620", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T17:02:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "BiologicalMe", "id": "21737699"}, "comment": "/* Parathyroid Gland */ remove duplicate consecutive reference", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox anatomy\n| Name        = Endocrine system\n| Latin       = Systema endocrinum\n| Image       = File:Illu endocrine system New.png\n| Caption     = Main glands of the endocrine system.

In [[humans]], the major [[endocrine gland]]s are the [[thyroid gland]] and the [[adrenal gland]]s.  In [[vertebrate]]s, the [[hypothalamus]] is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is [[endocrinology]], a branch of [[internal medicine]].<ref name=\"Marieb\">{{cite book | last = Marieb | first = Elaine | title = Anatomy & physiology | publisher = Pearson Education, Inc | location = Glenview, IL | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0321861580 }}</ref>\n\nSpecial features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, [[exocrine gland]]s, such as [[salivary gland]]s, [[sweat gland]]s, and [[glands]] within the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. A number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to as an axis, for example, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].\n\nIn addition to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above, many other organs that are part of other body systems, such as [[bone]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], [[heart]] and [[gonad]]s, have secondary endocrine functions. For example, the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as [[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]]. Hormones can consist of either amino acid complexes, [[steroid]]s, [[eicosanoid]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, or [[prostaglandin]]s.<ref name=Marieb/>\n\nThe endocrine system is in contrast to the [[exocrine system]], which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using [[Duct (anatomy)|ducts]]. As opposed to endocrine factors that travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system, other signaling molecules, such as [[paracrine]] factors involved in [[paracrine signalling]] diffuse over a relatively short distance.\n\nThe word ''endocrine'' derives via [[New Latin]] from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd|\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd]]}}, ''endon'', \"inside, within,\" and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9#Ancient Greek|\"exocrine\" from the \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9]]}}, ''kr\u012bn\u014d'', \"to separate, distinguish\".\n\n==Structure==\n===Major endocrine systems===\nThe human endocrine system consists of several systems that operate via [[feedback loop]]s.

Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: [[eicosanoid]]s, [[steroid]]s, and [[amino acid]]/[[protein]] derivatives ([[amine]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell ([[autocrine signaling|autocrine]] or [[intracrine|intracrine signalling]]) or nearby cells ([[paracrine signalling]]).\n\nHormones are used to communicate between [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and tissues for [[physiological]] regulation and [[behavioral]] activities, such as digestion, [[metabolism]], [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] function, [[sensory perception]], [[sleep]], [[excretion]], [[lactation]], [[Stress (physiology)|stress]], [[human development (biology)|growth and development]], [[Motor coordination|movement]], [[reproduction]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Neave N | title = Hormones and behaviour: a psychological approach | year =2008 | publisher = Cambridge Univ.

When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results in the activation of a [[signal transduction]] pathway. This may lead to cell type-specific responses that include rapid non-genomic effects or slower [[genomic]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2017}} responses where the hormones acting through their receptors activate gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] resulting in increased [[gene expression|expression]] of target proteins. Amino acid\u2013based hormones ([[amines]] and [[peptide hormone|peptide or protein hormones]]) are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via [[second messenger system|second messengers]]; [[steroid hormone]]s, being lipid-soluble, move through the plasma membranes of target cells (both [[cell membrane|cytoplasmic]] and [[nuclear membrane|nuclear]]) to act within their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]].\n\n===Cell signalling===\nThe typical mode of [[cell signalling]] in the endocrine system is endocrine signaling, that is, using the circulatory system to reach distant target organs. However, there are also other modes, i.e., paracrine, autocrine, and [[neuroendocrine]] signaling. Purely neurocrine signaling between [[neurons]], on the other hand, belongs completely to the [[nervous system]].\n\n====Autocrine====\n{{Main|Autocrine signalling}}\nAutocrine signaling is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the autocrine agent) that binds to autocrine receptors on the same cell, leading to changes in the cells.\n\n====Paracrine====\n{{Main|Paracrine signalling}}\nSome endocrinologists and clinicians include the paracrine system as part of the endocrine system, but there is not consensus. Paracrines are slower acting, targeting cells in the same tissue or organ. An example of this is [[somatostatin]] which is released by some pancreatic cells and targets other pancreatic cells.<ref name=Marieb/>\n\n====Juxtacrine====\n{{Main|Juxtacrine signalling}}\nJuxtacrine signaling is a type of intercellular communication that is transmitted via oligosaccharide, lipid, or protein components of a cell membrane, and may affect either the emitting cell or the immediately adjacent cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2000-01-01|title=Juxtacrine Signaling|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10072/|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIt occurs between adjacent cells that possess broad patches of closely opposed plasma membrane linked by transmembrane channels known as connexons.

Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of loss of reserve, hyposecretion, [[agenesis]], atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[neoplastic]] change, or hyperstimulation.\n\nEndocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland.

Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], design of robust [[computer network]]s, and the theory of [[error-correcting code]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nIntuitively, an expander is a finite, undirected [[multigraph]] in which every subset of the vertices that  is not \"too large\" has a \"large\" boundary. Different formalisations of these notions give rise to different notions of expanders: ''edge expanders'', ''vertex expanders'', and ''spectral expanders'', as defined below.\n\nA disconnected graph is not an expander, since the boundary of a connected component is empty. Every connected graph is an expander; however, different connected graphs have different expansion parameters. The [[complete graph]] has the best expansion property, but it has largest possible degree. Informally, a graph is a good expander if it has low degree and high expansion parameters.\n\n===Edge expansion===\nThe ''edge expansion'' (also ''isoperimetric number'' or [[Cheeger constant (graph theory)|Cheeger constant]]) ''h''(''G'') of a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices is defined as\n: <math>h(G) = \\min_{0 < |S| \\le \\frac{n}{2} } \\frac{|\\partial S|}{|S|},</math>\nwhere <math>\\partial S := \\{ (u, v) \\in E(G) \\ : \\ u \\in S, v \\in V(G) \\setminus S \\}.</math>\n\nIn the equation, the minimum is over all nonempty sets ''S'' of at most ''n''/2 vertices and \u2202''S'' is the ''edge boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in ''S''.<ref>Definition 2.1 in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref>\n\n===Vertex expansion===\nThe ''vertex isoperimetric number'' <math>h_{\\text{out}}(G)</math> (also ''vertex expansion'' or ''magnification'') of a graph ''G'' is defined as\n: <math>h_{\\text{out}}(G) = \\min_{0 < |S|\\le \\frac{n}{2}} \\frac{|\\partial_{\\text{out}}(S)|}{|S|},</math>\nwhere <math>\\partial_{\\text{out}}(S)</math> is the ''outer boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of vertices in <math>V(G)\\setminus S</math> with at least one neighbor in ''S''.<ref name=\"BobkovHoudre\">{{harvtxt|Bobkov|Houdr\u00e9|Tetali|2000}}</ref> In a variant of this definition (called ''unique neighbor expansion'') <math>\\partial_{\\text{out}}(S)</math> is replaced by the set of vertices in ''V'' with ''exactly'' one neighbor in ''S''.<ref name=\"AlonCapalbo\">{{harvtxt|Alon|Capalbo|2002}}</ref>\n\nThe ''vertex isoperimetric number'' <math>h_{\\text{in}}(G)</math> of a graph ''G'' is defined as\n: <math>h_{\\text{in}}(G) = \\min_{0 < |S|\\le \\frac{n}{2}} \\frac{|\\partial_{\\text{in}}(S)|}{|S|},</math>\nwhere <math>\\partial_{\\text{in}}(S)</math> is the ''inner boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of vertices in ''S'' with at least one neighbor in <math>V(G)\\setminus S</math>.<ref name=\"BobkovHoudre\" />\n\n===Spectral expansion===\nWhen ''G'' is [[regular graph|''d''-regular]], a [[linear algebra]]ic definition of expansion is possible based on the [[Eigenvalue#Eigenvalues of matrices|eigenvalues]] of the [[adjacency matrix]] ''A'' = ''A''(''G'') of ''G'', where <math>A_{ij}</math> is the number of edges between vertices ''i'' and ''j''.<ref>cf. Section 2.3 in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref> Because ''A'' is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], the [[spectral theorem]] implies that ''A'' has ''n'' real-valued eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\cdots \\ge \\lambda_{n}</math>. It is known that all these eigenvalues are in [\u2212''d'', ''d''].\n\nBecause ''G'' is regular, the uniform distribution <math>u\\in\\R^n</math> with <math>u_i=1/n</math> for all ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' is the [[stationary distribution]] of ''G''. That is, we have ''Au'' = ''du'', and ''u'' is an eigenvector of ''A'' with eigenvalue \u03bb<sub>1</sub> = ''d'', where ''d'' is the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the vertices of ''G''. The ''[[spectral gap]]'' of ''G'' is defined to be ''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03bb<sub>2</sub>, and it measures the spectral expansion of the graph ''G''.<ref>This definition of the spectral gap is from Section 2.3 in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref>\n\nIt is known that \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub> = \u2212''d'' if and only if ''G'' is bipartite. In many contexts, for example in the [[expander mixing lemma]], a bound on \u03bb<sub>2</sub> is not enough, but indeed it is necessary to bound the absolute value of ''all'' the eigenvalues away from ''d'':\n:<math>\\lambda=\\max\\{|\\lambda_2|, |\\lambda_n|\\}.</math>\nSince this is the largest eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector orthogonal to ''u'', it can be equivalently defined using the [[Rayleigh quotient]]:\n:<math>\\lambda=\\max_{v \\perp u , v \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|Av\\|_2}{\\|v\\|_2},</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\|v\\|_2=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2\\right)^{1/2}</math> \nis the [[2-norm]] of the vector <math>v\\in\\R^n</math>.\n\nThe normalized versions of these definitions are also widely used and more convenient in stating some results. Here one considers the matrix <math>\\tfrac{1}{d} A</math>, which is the [[Markov transition matrix]] of the graph ''G''. Its eigenvalues are between \u22121 and 1. For not necessarily regular graphs, the spectrum of a graph can be defined similarly using the eigenvalues of the [[Laplacian matrix]]. For directed graphs, one considers the [[singular values]] of the adjacency matrix ''A'', which are equal to the roots of the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix ''A<sup>T</sup>A''.\n\n==Relationships between different expansion properties==\nThe expansion parameters defined above are related to each other. In particular, for any ''d''-regular graph ''G'',\n\n:<math>h_{\\text{out}}(G) \\le h(G) \\le d \\cdot h_{\\text{out}}(G).</math>\n\nConsequently, for constant degree graphs, vertex and edge expansion are qualitatively the same.\n\n===Cheeger inequalities===\nWhen ''G'' is ''d''-regular, there is a relationship between the isoperimetric constant ''h''(''G'') and the gap ''d'' \u2212 \u03bb<sub>2</sub> in the spectrum of the adjacency operator of ''G''. By standard spectral graph theory, the trivial eigenvalue of the adjacency operator of a ''d''-regular graph is \u03bb<sub>1</sub>=''d'' and the first non-trivial eigenvalue is \u03bb<sub>2</sub>. If ''G'' is connected, then \u03bb<sub>2</sub> < ''d''. An inequality due to Dodziuk{{Sfn|Dodziuk|1984}} and independently [[Noga Alon|Alon]] and [[Vitali Milman|Milman]]{{Sfn|Alon|Spencer|2011}} states that<ref>Theorem 2.4 in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(d - \\lambda_2) \\le h(G) \\le \\sqrt{2d(d - \\lambda_2)}.</math>\n\nThis inequality is closely related to the [[Cheeger bound]] for [[Markov chains]] and can be seen as a discrete version of [[Cheeger constant#Cheeger.27s inequality|Cheeger's inequality]] in [[Riemannian geometry]].\n\nSimilar connections between vertex isoperimetric numbers and the spectral gap have also been studied:<ref>See Theorem 1 and p.156, l.1 in {{harvtxt|Bobkov|Houdr\u00e9|Tetali|2000}}. Note that \u03bb<sub>2</sub> there corresponds to 2(''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03bb<sub>2</sub>) of the current article (see p.153, l.5)</ref>\n: <math>h_{\\text{out}}(G)\\le \\left(\\sqrt{4 (d-\\lambda_2)} + 1\\right)^2 -1</math>\n: <math>h_{\\text{in}}(G) \\le \\sqrt{8(d-\\lambda_2)}.</math>\nAsymptotically speaking, the quantities <math>\\frac{h^2}{d}</math>, <math>h_{\\text{out}}</math>, and <math>h_{\\text{in}}^2</math> are all bounded above by the spectral gap <math>O(d-\\lambda_2)</math>.\n\n==Constructions==\nThere are three general strategies for constructing families of expander graphs.<ref>see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Yehudayoff|2012}}</ref> The first strategy is algebraic and group-theoretic, the second strategy is analytic and uses [[additive combinatorics]], and the third strategy is combinatorial and uses the [[zig-zag product|zig-zag]] and related graph products. [[Noga Alon]] showed that certain graphs constructed from [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] are the sparsest examples of highly expanding graphs.<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02579382 | doi=10.1007/BF02579382 | volume=6 | title=Eigenvalues, geometric expanders, sorting in rounds, and ramsey theory | journal=Combinatorica | pages=207\u2013219 | year=1986 | last1 = Alon | first1 = Noga}}</ref>\n\n===Margulis\u2013Gabber\u2013Galil===\n[[Abstract algebra|Algebraic]] constructions based on [[Cayley graph]]s are known for various variants of expander graphs. The following construction is due to Margulis and has been analysed by Gabber and Galil.<ref>see, e.g., p.9 of {{harvtxt|Goldreich|2011}}</ref> For every natural number ''n'', one considers the graph ''G<sub>n</sub>'' with the vertex set <math>\\mathbb Z_n \\times \\mathbb Z_n</math>, where <math>\\mathbb Z_n=\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z</math>: For every vertex <math>(x,y)\\in\\mathbb Z_n \\times \\mathbb Z_n</math>, its eight adjacent vertices are\n\n:<math>(x \\pm 2y,y), (x \\pm (2y+1),y), (x,y \\pm 2x), (x,y \\pm (2x+1)).</math>\n\nThen the following holds:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.''' For all ''n'', the graph ''G<sub>n</sub>'' has second-largest eigenvalue <math>\\lambda(G)\\leq 5 \\sqrt{2}</math>.</blockquote>\n\n===Ramanujan graphs===\n{{main article|Ramanujan graph}}\nBy a theorem of Alon and Boppana, all large enough ''d''-regular graphs satisfy <math>\\lambda \\ge 2\\sqrt{d-1} - o(1)</math>, where \u03bb is the second largest eigenvalue in absolute value.<ref>Theorem 2.7 of {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref> [[Ramanujan graph]]s are ''d''-regular graphs for which this bound is tight. That is, they satisfy <math>\\lambda \\le 2\\sqrt{d-1}</math>.<ref>Definition 5.11 of {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref> Hence Ramanujan graphs have an asymptotically smallest possible \u03bb. They are also excellent spectral expanders.\n\n[[Alexander Lubotzky|Lubotzky]], Phillips, and [[Peter Sarnak|Sarnak]] (1988), Margulis (1988), and Morgenstern (1994) show how Ramanujan graphs can be constructed explicitly.<ref>Theorem 5.12 of {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref> By a theorem of Friedman (2003), [[Random regular graph|random ''d''-regular graphs]] on ''n'' vertices are almost Ramanujan, that is, they satisfy\n\n:<math>\\lambda \\le 2\\sqrt{d-1}+\\varepsilon</math>\n\nfor every <math>\\varepsilon > 0</math> with probability <math>1-o(1)</math> as ''n'' tends to infinity.<ref>Theorem 7.10 of {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}</ref>\n\n==Applications and useful properties==\nThe original motivation for expanders is to build economical robust networks (phone or computer): an expander with bounded valence is precisely an asymptotic robust graph with the number of edges growing linearly with size (number of vertices), for all subsets.\n\nExpander graphs have found extensive applications in [[computer science]], in designing [[algorithm]]s, [[Expander code|error correcting codes]], [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractors]], [[pseudorandom generator]]s, [[sorting network]]s ({{harvtxt|Ajtai|Koml\u00f3s|Szemer\u00e9di|1983}}) and robust [[computer network]]s. They have also been used in proofs of many important results in [[computational complexity theory]], such as [[SL (complexity)|SL]]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[L (complexity)|L]] ({{harvtxt|Reingold|2008}}) and the [[PCP theorem]] ({{harvtxt|Dinur|2007}}). In [[cryptography]], expander graphs are used to construct [[hash function]]s.\n\nThe following are some properties of expander graphs that have proven useful in many areas.\n\n===Expander mixing lemma===\n{{Main article|Expander mixing lemma}}\nThe expander mixing lemma states that, for any two subsets of the vertices ''S'', ''T'' \u2286 ''V'', the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T'' is approximately what you would expect in a random ''d''-regular graph. The approximation is better the smaller <math>\\lambda=\\max\\{|\\lambda_2|,|\\lambda_n|\\}</math> is. In a random ''d''-regular graph, as well as in an [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model|Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graph]] with edge probability ''d''/''n'', we expect <math>\\tfrac{d}{n} \\cdot |S| \\cdot |T|</math> edges between ''S'' and ''T''.\n\nMore formally, let ''E''(''S'', ''T'') denote the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T''. If the two sets are not disjoint, edges in their intersection are counted twice, that is,\n\n: <math>E(S,T)=2|E(G[S\\cap T])| + E(S\\setminus T,T) + E(S,T\\setminus S). </math>\n\nThen the expander mixing lemma says that the following inequality holds:\n\n:<math>\\left|E(S, T) - \\frac{d \\cdot |S| \\cdot |T|}{n}\\right| \\leq d\\lambda  \\sqrt{|S| \\cdot |T|},</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bb'' is the absolute value of the '''normalized''' second largest eigenvalue.\n\n===Expander walk sampling===\n{{Main article|Expander walk sampling}}\nThe [[Chernoff bound]] states that, when sampling many independent samples from a random variables in the range [\u22121, 1], with high probability the average of our samples is close to the expectation of the random variable.  The expander walk sampling lemma, due to {{harvtxt|Ajtai|Koml\u00f3s|Szemer\u00e9di|1987}} and {{harvtxt|Gillman|1998}}, states that this also holds true when sampling from a walk on an expander graph. This is particularly useful in the theory of [[derandomization]], since sampling according to an expander walk uses many fewer random bits than sampling independently.\n\n===Expander property of the braingraphs===\nUsing the [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) data of the [[NIH]]-funded large [[Human Connectome Project]], it was shown by Szalkai et al.<ref name=\":47\">{{Cite journal|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130045|title = Graph Theoretical Analysis Reveals: Women\u2019s Brains Are Better Connected than Men\u2019s|last1 = Szalkai |first1 = Balazs | last2 = Varga | first2 = Balint | last3 = Grolmusz | first3 = Vince | date = 2015|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0130045|volume=10|number=7|pages=e0130045|pmid=26132764 | pmc=4488527}}</ref><ref name=\"Szalkai2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Szalkai|first1=Bal\u00e1zs|last2=Varga|first2=B\u00e1lint|last3=Grolmusz|first3=Vince|title=Brain size bias compensated graph-theoretical parameters are also better in women\u2019s structural connectomes|journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior|year=2017|issn=1931-7565|doi=10.1007/s11682-017-9720-0|pmid=28447246}}</ref> that the graph, describing the anatomical brain connections between up to 1015 cerebral areas, is a significantly better expander in women than in men.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algebraic connectivity]]\n*[[Zig-zag product]]\n*[[Superstrong approximation]]\n*[[Spectral graph theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n===Textbooks and surveys===\n* {{cite book|title=The Probabilistic Method|first1=N.|last1=Alon|author1-link=Noga Alon|first2=Joel H.|last2=Spencer|author2-link=Joel Spencer|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|edition=3rd|chapter=9.2.

It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved.\n\nBut in 1952, disappointed at what they saw as the lack of progress within the Council of Europe, six nations decided to go further and created the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which was declared to be \"a first step in the federation of Europe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Declaration of 9 May 1950|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007}}</ref> Visionary men such as [[Alcide De Gasperi]] from Italy, [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]] from France, and [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] from Belgium understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and that by tying their national industries together, future war between their nations was made impossible.<ref name=\"Europa History 45-59\">{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|title=A peaceful Europe&nbsp;\u2013 the beginnings of cooperation|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> These men and others are officially credited as the [[founding fathers of the European Union]].\n\n===Treaty of Rome (1957{{ndash}}92)===\n[[File:EC-EU-enlargement animation.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The continental territories of the member states of the European Union (European Communities pre-1993), coloured in order of accession]]\n\nIn 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and established a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]].

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n\n* the '''[[European Council]]''', which sets the ''general political directions'' and ''priorities'' of the Union by gathering together its member states' [[Head of state|heads of state]]/[[Head of government|government]] (elected chief executives). The conclusions of its summits (held at least quarterly) are adopted by consensus.\n* the '''[[European Commission]]''', the \"Guardian of the Treaties\" consists of an [[Cabinet (government)|executive cabinet]] of public officials, led by an [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] President. This ''College of Commissioners'' manages and directs the Commission's permanent civil service. It turns the consensus objectives of the European Council into [[European Union law|legislative proposals]].\n* the '''[[Council of the European Union]]''' brings together ministers of member states governments' departments. It forms the ''[[upper house]]'' of the EU's essentially [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] and its approval is required for any proposal to enter into law.\n* the '''[[European Parliament]]''' consists of 751 directly elected representatives, forming the EU's ''[[lower house]]'' of its bicameral legislature. It shares with the Council of the EU equal legislative powers to amend, approve or reject Commission proposals for most areas of EU legislation. Its powers are limited in areas where member states' view sovereignty to be of primary concern (i.e. defence). It elects the Commission's President, must approve the College of Commissioners, and may vote to remove them collectively from office.\n* the '''[[Court of Justice of the European Union]]''' ensures the uniform application of EU law and resolves disputes between EU institutions and member states, and against EU institutions on behalf of individuals.\n* the '''[[European Central Bank]]''' is responsible for monetary stability within member states.\n* the '''[[European Court of Auditors]]''' investigates the proper management of finances within both the EU entities and EU funding provided to its member states. As well as providing oversight and advice, it can refer unresolved issues to the European Court of Justice to arbitrate on any alleged irregularities.\n\nEU policy is in general promulgated by [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]], which are then implemented in the [[Sovereignty|domestic legislation]] of its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], and [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulations]], which are immediately enforceable in all member states.

The order includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub|bush]]es, [[liana]]s, and [[herbaceous]] plants. Together with ordinary [[Photosynthesis|autophytic]] plants, the Ericales include [[chlorophyll]]-deficient [[mycoheterotrophic]] plants (e.g., ''[[Sarcodes sanguinea]]'') and [[carnivorous plant]]s (e.g., genus ''[[Sarracenia]]'').\n\nMany species have five petals, often grown together.

Indeed, symbiosis with root fungi is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of it can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate [[aluminum]].<ref>(Jansen et al., 2004).</ref>\n\nEricales are a cosmopolitan order. Areas of distribution of families vary largely - while some are restricted to tropics, others exist mainly in Arctic or temperate regions. The entire order contains over 8,000 species, of which the Ericaceae account for 2,000-4,000 species (by various estimates).\n\n== Economic importance ==\nThe most commercially used plant in the order is [[tea]] (''Camellia sinensis'') from the [[Theaceae]] family. The order also includes some edible fruits, including [[kiwifruit]] (''Actinidia deliciosa''), [[persimmon]] (genus ''Diospyros''), [[blueberry]], [[huckleberry]], [[cranberry]], [[Brazil nut]], and [[Mamey sapote]]. The order also includes [[Vitellaria|shea]] (''Vitellaria paradoxa''), which is the major dietary lipid source for millions of sub-Saharan Africans.  Many Ericales species are cultivated for their showy flowers: well-known examples are [[azalea]], [[rhododendron]], [[camellia]], [[Calluna|heather]], [[Primula|polyanthus]], [[cyclamen]], [[phlox]], and [[busy Lizzie]].\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThese families are recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> as members of the Ericales:\n\n* Family [[Actinidiaceae]] ([[kiwifruit]] family)\n* Family [[Balsaminaceae]] ([[Impatiens|balsam]] family)[[File:Balsam I IMG 9566.jpg|thumb|''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'' from the [[Balsaminaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Clethraceae]] ([[clethra]] family)\n* Family [[Cyrillaceae]] ([[cyrilla]] family)\n* Family [[Diapensiaceae]]\n* Family [[Ebenaceae]] ([[ebony]] and [[persimmon]] family)\n* Family [[Ericaceae]] ([[Erica|heath]], [[rhododendron]], and [[Vaccinium|blueberry]] family)\n* Family [[Fouquieria]]ceae ([[ocotillo]] family)\n* Family [[Lecythidaceae]] ([[Brazil nut]] family)\n* Family [[Marcgraviaceae]]\n* Family [[Mitrastemonaceae]]\n* Family [[Pentaphylacaceae]]\n* Family [[Polemoniaceae]] ([[phlox]] family)\n* Family [[Primulaceae]] ([[Primula|primrose]] and [[Soldanella|snowbell]] family) [[File:Primula rosea I IMG 7210.jpg|thumb|''[[Primula rosea]]'' from the [[Primulaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Roridula]]ceae\n* Family [[Sapotaceae]] ([[sapodilla]] family)\n* Family [[Sarraceniaceae]] (American [[pitcher plant]] family)\n* Family [[Sladeniaceae]]\n* Family [[Styracaceae]] ([[Halesia|silverbell]] family)\n* Family [[Symplocaceae]] (sapphireberry family)\n* Family [[Tetrameristaceae]]\n* Family [[Theaceae]] ([[Camellia sinensis|tea]] and [[camellia]] family)\n\nThese families are not recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> but have been in common use in the recent past:\n\n* Family [[Myrsinaceae]] ([[cyclamen]] and [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] family) \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family [[Pellicieraceae]] \u2192 Tetrameristaceae\n* Family Maesaceae \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family Ternstroemiaceae \u2192 Pentaphylacaceae\n* Family [[Theophrastaceae]] \u2192 Primulaceae\n\nThese make up a basal group of [[asterid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bremer|first=Birgitta|author2=K\u00e5re Bremera |author3=Nahid Heidaria |author4=Per Erixona |author5=Richard G.

(2005). In Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. www.credoreference.com/entry/wileycs/sapir_edward</ref>\n\nSapir was born in [[German Empire|German]] [[Pomerania]]; his parents emigrated to United States of America when he was a child. He studied Germanic linguistics at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], where he came under the influence of [[Franz Boas]] who inspired him to work on [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]]. While finishing his Ph.D. he went to [[University of California, Berkeley|California]] to work with [[Alfred Kroeber]] documenting the indigenous languages there. He was employed by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] for fifteen years, where he came into his own as one of the most significant linguists in North America, the other being [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. He was offered a professorship at the [[University of Chicago]], and stayed for several years continuing to work for the professionalization of the discipline of linguistics. By the end of his life he was professor of anthropology at [[Yale University|Yale]], where he never really fit in. Among his many students were the linguists [[Mary Haas]] and [[Morris Swadesh]], and anthropologists such as [[Fred Eggan]] and [[Hortense Powdermaker]].\n\nWith his linguistic background, Sapir became the one student of Boas to develop most completely the relationship between linguistics and anthropology. Sapir studied the ways in which language and culture influence each other, and he was interested in the relation between linguistic differences, and differences in cultural world views. This part of his thinking was developed by his student [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] into the principle of [[linguistic relativity]] or the \"Sapir-Whorf\" hypothesis. In anthropology Sapir is known as an early proponent of the importance of [[psychology]] to [[anthropology]], maintaining that studying the nature of relationships between different individual personalities is important for the ways in which culture and society develop.<ref>Moore, Jerry D. 2009. \"Edward Sapir: Culture, Language, and the Individual\" in Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists, Walnut Creek, California: Altamira. pp. 88-104</ref>\n\nAmong his major contributions to linguistics is his [[Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas|classification of Indigenous languages of the Americas]], upon which he elaborated for most of his professional life. He played an important role in developing the modern concept of the [[phoneme]], greatly advancing the understanding of [[phonology]].\n\nBefore Sapir it was generally considered impossible to apply the methods of [[historical linguistics]] to languages of [[indigenous peoples]] because they were believed to be more primitive than the [[Indo-European languages]]. Sapir was the first to prove that the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] were equally valid when applied to indigenous languages. In the 1929 edition of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] he published what was then the most authoritative classification of Native American languages, and the first based on evidence from modern comparative linguistics. He was the first to produce evidence for the classification of the [[Algic languages|Algic]], [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], and [[Na-Dene languages]]. He proposed some [[Language family|language families]] that are not considered to have been adequately demonstrated, but which continue to generate investigation such as [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] and [[Penutian languages|Penutian]].\n\nHe specialized in the study of [[Athabascan languages]], [[Chinookan languages]], and Uto-Aztecan languages, producing important grammatical descriptions of [[Takelma language|Takelma]], [[Wasco-Wishram language|Wishram]], [[Colorado River Numic language|Southern Paiute]]. Later in his career he also worked with [[Yiddish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], as well as [[Germanic languages]], and he also was invested in the development of an [[International Auxiliary Language]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood and youth===\nSapir was born into a family of [[Lithuanian Jews]] in \t[[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg]] in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]] where his father, Jacob David Sapir, worked as a [[Hazzan|cantor]]. The family was not [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and his father maintained his ties to Judaism through its music. The Sapir family did not stay long in Pomerania and never accepted German as a nationality. Edward Sapir's first language was [[Yiddish]],<ref name=\"Darnell1\"/> and later English. In 1888, when he was four years old, the family moved to Liverpool, England, and in 1890 to the United States, to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. Here Edward Sapir lost his younger brother Max to [[typhoid fever]]. His father had difficulty keeping a job in a synagogue and finally settled in New York on the [[Lower East Side]], where the family lived in poverty. As Jacob Sapir could not provide for his family, Sapir's mother, Eva Seagal Sapir, opened a shop to supply the basic necessities. They formally divorced in 1910. After settling in New York, Edward Sapir was raised mostly by his mother, who stressed the importance of education for the upwardly social mobile, and turned the family increasingly away from Judaism. Even though Eva Sapir was an important influence, Sapir received his lust for knowledge and interest in scholarship, aesthetics, and music from his father. At age 14 Sapir won a Pulitzer scholarship to the prestigious [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann high school]], but he chose not to attend the school which he found too posh, going instead to [[DeWitt Clinton High School]],<ref name=Allyn>[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/dewitt-clintons-remarkable-alumni/ Allyn, Bobby\"DeWitt Clinton's Remarkable Alumni\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 2009. Accessed September 2, 2014.</ref> and saving the scholarship money for his college education. Through the scholarship Sapir supplemented his mother's meager earnings.<ref name=\"Darnell1\">Darnell 1990:1-4</ref>\n\n===Education at Columbia===\nSapir entered Columbia in 1901, still paying with the Pulitzer scholarship. Columbia at this time was one of the few elite private universities that did not [[Numerus clausus|limit admission of Jewish applicants]] with implicit quotas around 12%. Approximately 40% of incoming students at Columbia were Jewish.<ref>Darnell 1990:5</ref> Sapir earned both a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (1904) and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1905) in [[Germanic philology]] from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia]], before embarking on his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Anthropology]] which he completed in 1909.<ref>Darnell 1990:11-12, 14</ref>\n\n====College====\n[[File:PSM V63 D575 Columbia university library.png|thumb|[[Low Memorial Library|Columbia University library]] in 1903]]\n\nSapir emphasized language study in his college years at Columbia, studying Latin, Greek, and French for eight semesters. From his sophomore year he additionally began to focus on Germanic languages, completing coursework in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old High German]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Danish language|Danish]]. Through Germanics professor [[William Henry Carpenter (philologist)|William Carpenter]], Sapir was exposed to methods of [[comparative linguistics]] that were being developed into a more scientific framework than the traditional philological approach. He also took courses in Sanskrit, and  complemented his language studies by studying music in the department of the famous composer [[Edward MacDowell]] (though it is uncertain whether Sapir ever studied with MacDowell himself). In his last year in college Sapir enrolled in the course \"Introduction to Anthropology\", with Professor [[Livingston Farrand]], who taught the Boas \"four field\" approach to anthropology. He also enrolled in an advanced anthropology seminar taught by [[Franz Boas]], a course that would completely change the direction of his career.<ref>Darnell 1990:7-8</ref>\n\n====Influence of Boas====\n[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Boas]]]]\nAlthough still in college, Sapir was allowed to participate in the Boas graduate seminar on American Languages, which included translations of Native American and Inuit myths collected by Boas. In this way Sapir was introduced to Indigenous American languages while he kept working on his M.A. in Germanic linguistics. [[Robert Lowie]] later said that Sapir's fascination with indigenous languages stemmed from the seminar with Boas in which Boas used examples from Native American languages to disprove all of Sapir's common-sense assumptions about the basic nature of language. Sapir's 1905 Master's thesis was an analysis of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s ''Treatise on the Origin of Language'', and included examples from Inuit and Native American languages, not at all familiar to a Germanicist. The thesis criticized Herder for retaining a Biblical chronology, too shallow to allow for the observable diversification of languages, but he also argued with Herder that all of the world's languages have equal aesthetic potentials and grammatical complexity. He ended the paper by calling for a \"very extended study of all the various existing stocks of languages, in order to determine the most fundamental properties of language\" - almost a program statement for the modern study of [[linguistic typology]], and a very Boasian approach.<ref>Darnell 1990:9-15</ref>\n\nIn 1906 he finished his coursework, having focused the last year on courses in anthropology and taking seminars such as Primitive Culture with Farrand, [[Ethnology]] with Boas, [[Archaeology]] and courses in Chinese language and culture with [[Berthold Laufer]]. He also maintained his Indo-European studies with courses in [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], Old Saxon, Swedish, and Sanskrit. Having finished his coursework, Sapir moved on to his doctoral fieldwork, spending several years in short term appointments while working on his dissertation.<ref>Darnell 1990:13-14</ref>\n\n====Early fieldwork====\n[[File:Tilohash.jpg|thumb|Tony Tillohash with family. Tillohash was Sapir's collaborator on the famous description of the Southern Paiute language]]\nSapir's first fieldwork was on the [[Upper Chinook language|Wishram Chinook language]] in the summer of 1905, funded by the Bureau of American Ethnology. This first experience with Native American languages in the field was closely overseen by Boas, who was particularly interested in having Sapir gathering ethnological information for the Bureau. Sapir gathered a volume of Wishram texts, published 1909, and he managed to achieve a much more sophisticated understanding of the Chinook [[phonology|sound system]] than Boas. In the summer of 1906 he worked on [[Takelma language|Takelma]] and [[Shasta Costa|Chasta Costa]]. Sapir's work on Takelma became his doctoral dissertation, which he defended in 1908. The dissertation foreshadowed several important trends in Sapir's work, particularly the careful attention to the intuition of native speakers regarding sound patterns that later would become the basis for Sapir's formulation of the [[phoneme]].<ref>Darnell 1990:23</ref>\n\nIn 1907 - 1908 Sapir was offered a position at the [[University of California]], where Boas' first student [[Alfred Kroeber]] was the head of a project under the California state survey to document the Indigenous languages of California. Kroeber suggested that Sapir study the nearly extinct [[Yana language]], and Sapir set to work. Sapir worked first with Betty Brown, one of the language's few remaining speakers. Later he began work with Sam Batwi, who spoke another dialect of Yana, but whose knowledge of Yana mythology was an important fount of knowledge. Sapir described the way in which the Yana language distinguishes grammatically and lexically between the speech of men and women.<ref>Darnell 1990:26</ref>\n\nThe collaboration between Kroeber and Sapir was made difficult by the fact that Sapir largely followed his own interest in detailed linguistic description, ignoring the administrative pressures to which Kroeber was subject, among them the need for a speedy completion and a focus on the broader classification issues. In the end Sapir didn't finish the work during the allotted year, and Kroeber was unable to offer him a longer appointment.\n\nDisappointed at not being able to stay at Berkeley, Sapir devoted his best efforts to other work, and did not get around to preparing any of the Yana material for publication until 1910,<ref>Sapir, Edward. 1910. ''Yana Texts''. University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, vol. 1, no. 9. Berkeley: University Press. ([https://archive.org/details/yanatexts00sapirich Online version] at the [[Internet Archive]]).</ref> to Kroeber's deep disappointment.<ref>Darnell 1990:24-29</ref>\n\nSapir ended up leaving California early to take up a fellowship at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he taught Ethnology and American Linguistics. At Pennsylvania he worked closely with another student of Boas, [[Frank Speck]], and the two undertook work on [[Catawba language|Catawba]] in the summer of 1909.<ref>Darnell 1990:29-31</ref> Also in the summer of 1909, Sapir went to Utah with his student [[J. Alden Mason]]. Intending originally to work on Hopi, he studied the [[Colorado River Numic language]]; he decided to work with [[Tony Tillohash]], who proved to be the perfect informant. Tillohash's strong intuition about the sound patterns of his language led Sapir to propose that the [[phoneme]] is not just an abstraction existing at the structural level of language, but in fact has psychological reality for speakers.\n\nTillohash became a good friend of Sapir, and visited him at his home in New York and Philadelphia. Sapir worked with his father to transcribe a number of Southern Paiute songs that Tillohash knew. This fruitful collaboration laid the ground work for the classical description of the Southern Paiute language published in 1930,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sapir | first1 = Edward | title = The Southern Paiute language | url = | journal = Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 1\u2013730 | doi=10.2307/20026309}}</ref> and enabled Sapir to produce conclusive evidence linking the [[Shoshonean languages]] to the [[Nahuan languages]] - establishing the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]]. Sapir's description of Southern Paiute is known by linguistics as \"a model of analytical excellence\".<ref>Darnell 1990:34</ref>\n\nAt Pennsylvania, Sapir was urged to work at a quicker pace than he felt comfortable. His \"Grammar of Southern Paiute\" was supposed to be published in Boas' ''[[Handbook of American Indian Languages]]'', and Boas urged him to complete a preliminary version while funding for the publication remained available, but Sapir did not want to compromise on quality, and in the end the ''Handbook'' had to go to press without Sapir's piece. Boas kept working to secure a stable appointment for his student, and by his recommendation Sapir ended up being hired by the Canadian Geological Survey, who wanted him to lead the institutionalization of anthropology in Canada.<ref>Darnell 1990:42</ref> Sapir, who by then had given up the hope of working at one of the few American research universities, accepted the appointment and moved to Ottawa.\n\n===In Ottawa===\nIn the years 1910\u201325 Sapir established and directed the Anthropological Division in\nthe [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in Ottawa. When he was hired, he was one of the first full-time anthropologists in Canada. He brought his parents with him to Ottawa, and also quickly established his own family, marrying Florence Delson, who also had Lithuanian Jewish roots. Neither the Sapirs nor the Delsons were in favor of the match.  The Delsons, who hailed from the prestigious Jewish center of [[Vilna]], considered the Sapirs to be rural upstarts and were less than impressed with Sapir's career in an unpronounceable academic field. Edward and Florence had three children together: Herbert Michael, Helen Ruth, and Philip.<ref>Darnell 1990:44-48</ref>\n\n====Canada's Geological Survey====\nAs director of the Anthropological division of the Geological Survey of Canada, Sapir embarked on a project to document the Indigenous cultures and languages of Canada. His first fieldwork took him to [[Vancouver Island]] to work on the [[Nuu-chah-nulth language|Nootka]] language. Apart from Sapir the division had two other staff members, [[Marius Barbeau]] and Harlan I. Smith. Sapir insisted that the discipline of linguistics was of integral importance for ethnographic description, arguing that just as nobody would dream of discussing the history of the Catholic Church without knowing Latin or study German folksongs without knowing German, so it made little sense to approach the study of Indigenous folklore without knowledge of the indigenous languages.<ref>Darnell 1990:50</ref> At this point the only Canadian [[first nation]] languages that were well known were Kwakiutl, described by Boas, Tshimshian and Haida. Sapir explicitly used the standard of documentation of European languages, to argue that the amassing knowledge of indigenous languages was of paramount importance. By introducing the high standards of Boasian anthropology, Sapir incited antagonism from those amateur ethnologists who felt that they had contributed important work. Unsatisfied with efforts by amateur and governmental anthropologists, Sapir worked to introduce an academic program of anthropology at one of the major universities, in order to professionalize the discipline.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Stephen O | year = 1991 | title = The Canadian Winter' of Edward Sapir | url = | journal = Historiographia Linguistica | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 63\u201368 | doi=10.1075/hl.8.1.04mur}}</ref>\n\nSapir enlisted the assistance of fellow Boasians: [[Frank Speck]], [[Paul Radin]] and [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], who with Barbeau worked on the peoples of the Eastern Woodlands: the [[Ojibwa]], the Iroquois, the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Sapir initiated work on the [[Athabascan languages]] of the [[Mackenzie valley]] and the [[Yukon]], but it proved too difficult to find adequate assistance, and he concentrated mainly on Nootka and the languages of the North West Coast.<ref>Darnell 1990:74-79</ref>\n\nDuring his time in Canada, together with Speck, Sapir also acted as an advocate for Indigenous rights, arguing publicly for introduction of better medical care for Indigenous communities, and assisting the Six Nation Iroquois in trying to recover eleven [[wampum]] belts that had been stolen from the reservation and were on display in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania.  (The belts were finally returned to the Iroquois in 1988.) He also argued for the reversal of a Canadian law prohibiting the [[Potlatch]] ceremony of the West Coast tribes.<ref>Darnell 1990:59</ref>\n\n====Work with Ishi====\n[[File:Ishi.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred L. Kroeber|Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Ishi]]]]\n\nIn 1915 Sapir returned to California, where his expertise on the Yana language made him urgently needed. Kroeber had come into contact with [[Ishi]], the last native speaker of the [[Yahi language]], closely related to Yana, and needed someone to document the language urgently. [[Ishi]], who had grown up without contact to whites, was monolingual in Yahi and was the last surviving member of his people. He had been adopted by the Kroebers, but had fallen ill with [[tuberculosis]], and was not expected to live long. Sam Batwi, the speaker of Yana who had worked with Sapir, was unable to understand the Yahi variety, and Krober was convinced that only Sapir would be able to communicate with Ishi. Sapir traveled to [[San Francisco]] and worked with Ishi over the summer of 1915, having to invent new methods for working with a monolingual speaker. The information from Ishi was invaluable for understanding the relation between the different dialects of Yana. Ishi died of his illness in early 1916, and Kroeber partly blamed the exacting nature of working with Sapir for his failure to recover. Sapir described the work: \"I think I may safely say that my work with Ishi is by far the most time-consuming and nerve-racking that I have ever undertaken. Ishi's imperturbable good humor alone made the work possible, though it also at times added to my exasperation\".<ref>Darnell 1990:81</ref>\n\n====Moving on====\n[[File:Margaret Mead NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Mead]] decades after her affair with Sapir]]\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] took its toll on the Canadian Geological Survey, cutting funding for anthropology and making the academic climate less agreeable. Sapir continued work on Athabascan, working with two speakers of the Alaskan languages [[Kutchin language|Kutchin]] and [[Ingalik language|Ingalik]]. Sapir was now more preoccupied with testing hypotheses about historical relationships between the [[Na-Dene languages]] than with documenting endangered languages, in effect becoming a theoretician.<ref>Darnell 1990:83-86</ref> He was also growing to feel isolated from his American colleagues. From 1912 Florence's health deteriorated due to a [[lung abscess]], and a resulting depression. The Sapir household was largely run by Eva Sapir, who did not get along well with Florence, and this added to the strain on both Florence and Edward. Sapir's parents had by now divorced and his father seemed to suffer from a psychosis, which made it necessary for him to leave Canada for [[Philadelphia]], where Edward continued to support him financially. Florence was hospitalized for long periods both for her depressions and for the lung abscess, and she died in 1924 due to an infection following surgery, providing the final incentive for Sapir to leave Canada. When the University of Chicago offered him a position, he happily accepted.\n\nDuring his period in Canada, Sapir came into his own as the leading figure in linguistics in North America. Among his substantial publications from this period were his book on ''Time Perspective in the Aboriginal American Culture'' (1916), in which he laid out an approach to using historical linguistics to study the prehistory of Native American cultures. Particularly important for establishing him in the field was his seminal book ''Language'' (1921), which was a layman's introduction to the discipline of linguistics as Sapir envisioned it. He also participated in the formulation of a report to the [[American Anthropological Association]] regarding the standardization of orthographic principles for writing Indigenous languages.\n\nWhile in Ottawa, he also collected and published French Canadian Folk Songs, and wrote a volume of his own poetry.<ref>''Dreams & Gibes'' (1917)</ref> His interest in poetry led him to form a close friendship with another Boasian anthropologist and poet, [[Ruth Benedict]]. Sapir initially wrote to Benedict to commend her for her dissertation on \"The Guardian Spirit\", but soon realized that Benedict had published poetry pseudonymously. In their correspondence the two critiqued each other's work, both submitting to the same publishers, and both being rejected. They also were both interested in psychology and the relation between individual personalities and cultural patterns, and in their correspondences they frequently [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyzed]] each other. However, Sapir often showed little understanding for Benedict's private thoughts and feelings, and particularly his conservative gender ideology jarred with Benedict's struggles as a female professional academic. Though they were very close friends for a while, it was ultimately the differences in worldview and personality that led their friendship to fray.<ref>Darnell 1990:1972-83</ref>\n\nBefore departing Canada, Sapir had a short affair with [[Margaret Mead]], Benedict's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at Columbia. But Sapir's conservative ideas about marriage and the woman's role were anathema to Mead, as they had been to Benedict, and as Mead left to do field work in [[Samoa]], the two separated permanently. Mead received news of Sapir's remarriage while still in Samoa, and burned their correspondence there on the beach.<ref>Darnell 1990:187</ref>\n\n===Chicago years===\nSettling in Chicago reinvigorated Sapir intellectually and personally. He socialized with intellectuals, gave lectures, participated in poetry and music clubs. His first graduate student at Chicago was [[Li Fang-Kuei]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Golla|first= Victor|year=2011|title=California Indian Languages|chapter=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_yqdSE1F8wC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=li+fang-kuei+yale&source=bl&ots=YVgUxPD0cp&sig=ZRnVkk6qAq-rH8-KT92uIEwgCWE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3V8TVZGgNMrnoASXtIHACg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwDQ#v=snippet&q=%22sapir's%20first%20graduate%20student%22&f=false}}</ref> The Sapir household continued to be managed largely by Grandmother Eva, until Sapir remarried in 1926. Sapir's second wife, Jean Victoria McClenaghan, was sixteen years younger than he. She had first met Sapir when a student in Ottawa, but had since also come to work at the University of Chicago's department of Juvenile Research. Their son Paul Edward Sapir was born in 1928.<ref>Darnell 1990:204-7</ref> Their other son [[J. David Sapir]] became a linguist and anthropologist specializing in West African Languages, especially [[Jola languages]]. Sapir also exerted influence through his membership in the [[Chicago School (sociology)|Chicago School of Sociology]], and his friendship with psychologist [[Harry Stack Sullivan]].\n\n===At Yale===\nFrom 1931 until his death in 1939, Sapir taught at [[Yale University]], where he became the head of the Department of Anthropology. He was invited to Yale to found an interdisciplinary program combining anthropology, linguistics and psychology, aimed at studying \"the impact of culture on personality\". While Sapir was explicitly given the task of founding a distinct anthropology department, this was not well received by the department of sociology who worked by [[William Graham Sumner]]'s \"Evolutionary sociology\", which was anathema to Sapir's Boasian approach, nor by the two anthropologists of the Institute for Human Relations [[Clark Wissler]] and [[G. P. Murdock]].<ref name=\"Darnell 1998\">Darnell 1998</ref> Sapir never thrived at Yale, where as one of only four Jewish faculty members out of 569 he was denied membership to the faculty club where the senior faculty discussed academic business.<ref>Gelya Frank. 1997. Jews, Multiculturalism, and Boasian Anthropology. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 99, No. 4, pp. 731-745</ref>\n\nAt Yale, Sapir's graduate students included [[Morris Swadesh]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Mary Haas]], [[Charles Hockett]], and [[Harry Hoijer]], several of whom he brought with him from Chicago.<ref>Haas, M. R. (1953), Sapir and the Training of Anthropological Linguists. American Anthropologist, 55: 447\u2013450.</ref> Sapir came to regard a young [[Semitic languages|Semiticist]] named [[Zellig Harris]] as his intellectual heir, although Harris was never a formal student of Sapir. (For a time he dated Sapir's daughter.)<ref name=\"daughter\">Reported by [[Regna Darnell]], Sapir's biographer (p.c. to Bruce Nevin).</ref>  In 1936 Sapir clashed with the Institute for Human Relations over the research proposal by anthropologist [[Hortense Powdermaker]], who proposed a study of the black community of Indianola, Mississippi. Sapir argued that her research should be funded instead of the more sociological work of [[John Dollard]]. Sapir eventually lost the discussion and Powdermaker had to leave Yale.<ref name=\"Darnell 1998\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1937 while teaching at the Linguistic Institute of the [[Linguistic Society of America]] in [[Ann Arbor]], Sapir began having problems with a heart condition that had initially been diagnosed a couple of years earlier.<ref>Morris Swadesh. 1939. \"Edward Sapir\" Language Vol. 15, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1939), pp. 132-135</ref>  In 1938, he had to take a leave from Yale, during which Benjamin Lee Whorf taught his courses and G. P. Murdock advised some of his students. After Sapir's death in 1939, G. P. Murdock became the chair of the anthropology department. Murdock, who despised the Boasian paradigm of cultural anthropology, dismantled most of Sapir's efforts to integrate anthropology, psychology, and linguistics.<ref>Darnell, R. (1998), Camelot at Yale: The Construction and Dismantling of the Sapirian Synthesis, 1931-39. American Anthropologist, 100: 361\u2013372.</ref>\n\n==Anthropological thought==\nSapir's anthropological thought has been described as isolated within the field of anthropology in his own days. Instead of searching for the ways in which culture influences human behavior, Sapir was interested in understanding how cultural patterns themselves were shaped by the composition of individual personalities that make up a society. This made Sapir cultivate an interest in individual psychology and his view of culture was more psychological than many of his contemporaries.<ref>Moore 2009</ref><ref>Richard J. Preston. 1966.  Edward Sapir's Anthropology: Style, Structure, and Method. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 68, No. 5, pp. 1105-1128</ref> It has been suggested that there is a close relation between Sapir's literary interests and his anthropological thought. His literary theory saw individual aesthetic sensibilities and creativity to interact with learned cultural traditions to produce unique and new poetic forms, echoing the way that he also saw individuals and cultural patterns to dialectically influence each other.<ref>Richard Handler. 1984. Sapir's Poetic Experience. American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 86, No. 2, pp. 416-417</ref>\n\n==Breadth of languages studied==\nSapir's special focus among American languages was in the [[Athabaskan]] languages, a family which especially fascinated him. In a private letter, he wrote: \"[[Dene]] is probably the son-of-a-bitchiest language in America to actually ''know''...most fascinating of all languages ever invented.\"<ref>Krauss 1986:157</ref> Sapir also studied the languages and cultures of [[Chinookan languages|Wishram Chinook]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]], [[Colorado River Numic language|Colorado River Numic]], [[Takelma language|Takelma]], and [[Yahi|Yana]]. His research on Southern Paiute, in collaboration with consultant [[Tony Tillohash]], led to a 1933 article which would become influential in the characterization of the [[phoneme]].<ref name=\"sapir1933\">{{cite journal|language=French|last=Sapir|first= Edward|year= 1933 |title=La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 psychologique des phon\u00e8mes (The psychological reality of phonemes) |journal= Journal de Psychologie Normale et Pathologique}}</ref>\n\nAlthough noted for his work on American linguistics, Sapir wrote prolifically in linguistics in general. His book ''Language'' provides everything from a grammar-typological classification of languages (with examples ranging from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to Nootka) to speculation on the phenomenon of [[language drift]],<ref>Malkiel, Yakov. 1981.  Drift, Slope, and Slant: Background of, and Variations upon, a Sapirian Theme.  Language, Vol. 57, No. 3 (Sep., 1981), pp. 535-570</ref> and the arbitrariness of associations between language, race, and culture. Sapir was also a pioneer in [[Yiddish]] studies (his first language) in the United States (cf. ''Notes on Judeo-German phonology'', 1915).\n\nSapir was active in the [[international auxiliary language]] movement. In his paper \"The Function of an International Auxiliary Language\", he argued for the benefits of a regular grammar and advocated a critical focus on the fundamentals of language, unbiased by the idiosyncrasies of national languages, in the choice of an international auxiliary language.\n\nHe was the first Research Director of the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA), which presented the [[Interlingua]] conference in 1951. He directed the Association from 1930 to 1931, and was a member of its Consultative Counsel for Linguistic Research from 1927 to 1938.<ref>Gopsill, F. Peter.

From the Greek Church the custom was adopted by either the Roman Catholics or the Protestants and then spread through Europe.\"<ref name=\"Thompson2013\"/> Both Thompson, as well as British orientalist [[Thomas Hyde]] state that in addition to dying the eggs red, the early Christians of Mesopotamia also stained Easter eggs green and yellow.<ref name=\"Ellis1877\"/><ref name=\"Thompson2013\"/>\n\nInfluential 19th century [[folkloristics|folklorist]] and [[philology|philologist]] [[Jacob Grimm]] speculates, in the second volume of his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', that the [[folk custom]] of Easter eggs among the continental Germanic peoples may have stemmed from springtime festivities of a [[list of Germanic deities|Germanic goddess]] known in Old English as [[\u0112ostre]] (namesake of modern English ''Easter'') and possibly known in Old High German as *''Ostara'' (and thus namesake of Modern German ''Ostern'' 'Easter'):\n<blockquote>\n:The heathen Easter had much in common with May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people ''Easter-games'' so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of ''Easter eggs'', and to the ''Easter tale'' which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.<ref Name=Grimm>Grimm, Jacob (James Steven Stallybrass Trans.) (1883). ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology: Translated from the Fourth Edition with Notes and Appendix]]'' Vol. II. London: George Bell and Sons. pp780-781</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough one of the Christian traditions are to use dyed or painted chicken eggs, a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with [[candy]] such as [[jelly bean]]s. These eggs can be hidden for children to find on Easter morning, which may be left by the [[Easter Bunny]]. They may also be put in a [[basket]] filled with real or artificial straw to resemble a [[bird nest|bird's nest]].\n\n==Decoration and symbolism==\n{{Main article|Egg decorating||Pisanica (Croatian)|Pysanka|\u015awi\u0119conka}}\n[[File:Uskr\u0161nja ko\u0161arica2.jpg|thumb|Croatian [[Easter basket]]]]\n[[File:\u015awi\u0119cone2007.jpg|thumb|left|Blessing of Easter foods in [[Poland]]]]\n[[File:Pasxalina abga.jpg|thumb|Red coloured Easter eggs]]\n\n===Lenten tradition===\nThe Easter egg tradition may also have merged into the celebration of the end of the privations of [[Lent]] in the West.\nHistorically, it was traditional to use up all of the household's eggs before Lent began.\nEggs were originally forbidden during [[Lent]] as well as on other traditional [[fasting|fast]] days in [[Western Christianity]] (this tradition still continues among the [[Eastern Christian Churches]]).\nLikewise, in [[Eastern Christianity]], meat, eggs, and [[dairy]] are all prohibited during the [[Great Lent|Lenten fast]].\n\nThis established the tradition of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] being celebrated on [[Shrove Tuesday]]. This day, the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]] when Lent begins, is also known as [[Mardi Gras]], a French phrase which translates as \"Fat Tuesday\" to mark the last consumption of eggs and dairy before Lent begins.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, [[Great Lent]] begins on [[Clean Monday]], rather than Wednesday, so the household's dairy products would be used up in the preceding week, called [[Cheesefare Week]].\n\nDuring Lent, since chickens would not stop producing eggs during this time, a larger than usual store might be available at the end of the fast. This surplus, if any, had to be eaten quickly to prevent spoiling. Then, with the coming of Easter, the eating of eggs resumes.  Some families cook a special meatloaf with eggs in it to be eaten with the Easter dinner.\n\nOne would have been forced to hard boil the [[boiled egg|eggs]] that the chickens produced so as not to waste food, and for this reason the [[Spain|Spanish]] dish [[hornazo]] (traditionally eaten on and around Easter) contains hard-boiled eggs as a primary ingredient.\nIn [[Hungary]], eggs are used sliced in potato casseroles around the Easter period.\n\n===Symbolism and related customs===\nSome Christians symbolically link the cracking open of Easter eggs with the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12170383/When-is-Easter-2016-What-are-the-dates-for-Good-Friday-Easter-Sunday-and-Easter-Monday.html|title=When is Easter 2016?

The egg is seen by followers of [[Christianity]] as a symbol of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it.<ref name=Meaning/><ref name=\"Symbolism\"/>\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Poland]], the so-called [[\u015bwi\u0119conka]], i.e. blessing of decorative baskets with a sampling of Easter eggs and other symbolic foods, is one of the most enduring and beloved Polish traditions on Holy Saturday.\n\nDuring [[Paschaltide]], in some traditions the Pascal greeting with the Easter egg is even extended to the deceased. On either the second Monday or Tuesday of Pascha, after a [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] people bring blessed eggs to the cemetery and bring the joyous [[paschal greeting]], \"Christ has risen\", to their beloved departed (see [[Radonitza]]).\n\nIn [[Greece]], women traditionally dye the eggs with onion skins and vinegar on Thursday (also the day of [[Communion rite|Communion]]). These ceremonial eggs are known as kokkina avga. They also bake [[tsoureki]] for the Easter Sunday feast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominiquesvillas.co.uk/en/blog/index.cfm/kalo-paska-happy-easter|title=Kalo Paska - Happy Easter|first=Natalie|last=Wagstaff|publisher=}}</ref> Red Easter eggs are sometimes served along the centerline of tsoureki (braided loaf of bread).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/food/index.ssf/2014/04/todays_easterpassover_recipe_f_1.html|title=Today's Recipe from Our Files: Greek Easter bread, Tsoueki|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Red and Butter, Martha Stewart magazine</ref>\n\nIn [[Egypt]], it's a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during [[Sham el-Nessim]] holiday, which falls every year after the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Easter]].\n\n===Colouring===\n[[File:Ostereier - Easter eggs.jpg|thumb|Colors for the Easter eggs]]\n[[File:Urz\u0105dzenie podgrzewaj\u0105ce kolorowy wosk do malowania pisanek - detal.jpg|thumb|Heated wax paint used to decorate traditional Easter Eggs in the Czech Republic]]\nThe dying of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural substances (such as, [[onion]] peel (brown colour), [[oak]] or [[alder]] bark or [[walnut]] nutshell (black), [[beet]] juice (pink) etc.), or using [[artificial colouring]]s.\n\nA greater variety of colour was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen [[yarn]]. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, from a dialectal form of Middle English ''pasche''. They were usually eaten after an egg-jarping ([[egg tapping]]) competition.\n\nIn the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the [[blood of Christ]], with further symbolism being found in the hard shell of the egg symbolizing the sealed [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]] \u2014 the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead.\n\n===Patterning===\nWhen boiling them with onion skins leaves can be attached prior to dying to create leaf patterns. The leaves are attached to the eggs before they are dyed with a transparent cloth to wrap the eggs with like inexpensive muslin or nylon stockings, leaving patterns once the leaves are removed after the dyeing process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-dye-easter-eggs-naturally-without-a-box-onion-skins-beets-cabbage.html|title=How to Dye Easter eggs naturally without a box onion skins beets cabbage|publisher=seriouseats.com|accessdate=<!-- 2014 -->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://natashaskitchen.com/2013/03/19/natural-easter-eggs-3-ways/|title=Natural Easter Eggs 3 Ways!/ with nylon stockings|publisher=natashaskitchen.com|accessdate=<!-- 2014 -->}}</ref> These eggs are part of [[Easter custom]] in many areas and often accompany other traditional [[Easter food]]s.

The word comes from the verb ''pysaty'', \"to write\", as the designs are not painted on, but written with [[beeswax]]. \n\nDecorating eggs for Easter using wax resistant batik is a popular method in some other eastern European countries. \n\n=== Use of Easter eggs in decorations ===\nIn some [[Mediterranean]] countries, especially in [[Lebanon]], chicken eggs are boiled and decorated by dye and/or painting and used as decoration around the house. Then, on [[Easter Day]], young kids would duel with them saying 'Christ is resurrected, Indeed, He is', breaking and eating them. This also happens in [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], Macedonia, [[Romania]], Russia, Serbia and Ukraine. In Easter Sunday friends and family hit each other's egg with their own. The one whose egg does not break is believed to be in for good luck in the future.\n\nIn Germany, eggs decorate trees and bushes as [[Easter egg tree]]s, and in several areas public wells as [[Osterbrunnen]].\n\nThere used to be a custom in [[Ukraine]], during Easter celebrations to have ''[[krashanky]]'' on a table in a bowl with wheatgrass. The number of the ''krashanky'' equalled the number of departed family members.<ref>Yakovenko, Svitlana 2017, \u201cThe Magical Dyed Egg \u2013 Krashanka\u201d in [http://sovabooks.com.au/the-book-about-ukrainian-easter/ '''''Traditional Velykden: Ukrainian Easter Recipes'''''], Sova Books, Sydney</ref>\n\n<!--====================================================================================================================\n    | PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS GALLERY BECAUSE THIS GALLERY IS HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PICTURES\n====================================================================================================================-->\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Pysanky2011.JPG|Ukrainian Easter eggs\nFile:Sorbische Ostereier.jpg|Easter eggs from [[Sorbs]]\nFile:Marguciai2. 2007-04-21.jpg|Easter eggs from [[Lithuania]]\nFile:Sleepingbeauty.jpg|Perforated egg from [[Germany]], Sleeping Beauty\nFile:Egg dekorerte.jpg|Norwegian Easter eggs\nFile:Ostereier-Griechenland.JPG|Easter eggs from [[Greece]]\nFile:Pisanki a\u017curowe.jpg|Perforated eggs\nFile:Oeuf de paque.JPG|Easter eggs from [[France]]\nFile:White House Easter Egg Roll.jpg|American Easter egg from the [[White House]] [[Washington, D.C.]]\nFile:Oeufs.jpg|Pace eggs boiled with onion skins and leaf patterns.\nFile:Red and blue Easter eggs.jpg|Easter eggs decorated with straw\nFile:04 Easter eggs at a Cultural Miner's House in Sanok.JPG|Easter egg from [[Poland]]\n\n|PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS GALLERY BECAUSE THIS GALLERY IS HAS REACHED ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PICTURES\n</gallery>\n\n== Easter egg games ==\n[[File:Easter Egg Hunt (5623253840).jpg|thumb|Eggs hidden for an [[Egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]]]]\n\n===Egg hunts===\nAn [[egg hunt]] is a game in which [[decorated egg]]s, which may be hard-boiled chicken eggs, [[chocolate]] eggs, or artificial eggs containing [[candy|candies]], are hidden for children to find.

Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a [[lunisolar calendar]] similar to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]]. (See also [[Computus]] and [[Reform of the date of Easter]].) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 7, Chapter 18}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35880795|title=Why can't the date of Easter be fixed|publisher=BBC|language=English|author=Caroline Wyatt|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> inclusive, within about seven days after the astronomical full moon.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter].

Because of the 13-day difference between the calendars between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian calendar (the Julian calendar is no longer used as the civil calendar of the countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate). Also, because the Julian \"full moon\" is always several days after the astronomical full moon, the eastern Easter is often later, relative to the visible moon's phases, than western Easter.\n\nAmong the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] some churches have changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and the date for Easter as for other fixed and moveable feasts is the same as in the Western church.<ref>\"The Church in Malankara switched entirely to the Gregorian calendar in 1953, following Encyclical No. 620 from Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I, dt.

Their starting point in determining the date of Orthodox Easter is also 21 March but according to the Julian reckoning, which in the current century corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIn addition, the lunar tables of the Julian calendar are four days (sometimes five days) behind those of the Gregorian calendar. The 14th day of the lunar month according to the Gregorian system is figured as the ninth or tenth day according to the Julian. The result of this combination of solar and lunar discrepancies is divergence in the date of Easter in most years (see table).\n\nEaster is determined on the basis of [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] cycles. The lunar year consists of 30-day and 29-day lunar months, generally alternating, with an [[embolismic month]] added periodically to bring the lunar cycle into line with the solar cycle. In each solar year (1 January to 31 December inclusive), the lunar month beginning with an [[ecclesiastical new moon]] falling in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive is designated as the paschal lunar month for that year.<ref name=\"smart.net\">Montes, Marcos J.

For the British Empire and colonies, a determination of the date of Easter Sunday using [[Golden number (time)|Golden Numbers]] and [[Sunday letter]]s was defined by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] with its Annexe. This was designed to match exactly the Gregorian calculation.\n\n=== Controversies over the date ===\n{{main|Easter controversy}}\n[[File:5part-icon.jpeg|thumb|right|A five-part [[Russian Orthodox]] icon depicting the Easter story.<br>Eastern Orthodox Christians use a different computation for the date of Easter than the Western churches.]]\nThe precise date of Easter has at times been a matter of contention. By the later 2nd century, it was widely accepted that the celebration of the holiday was a practice of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and an undisputed tradition. The [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodeciman]] controversy, the first of several [[Easter controversy|Easter controversies]], arose concerning the date on which the holiday should be celebrated.\n\nThe term \"Quartodeciman\" refers to the practice of celebrating Easter on [[Nisan]] 14 of the [[Hebrew calendar]], \"the {{LORD}}'s passover\" ({{bibleverse || Leviticus|23:5}}). According to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], the Quartodeciman [[Polycarp]] (bishop of Smyrna, by tradition a disciple of [[John the Apostle]]) debated the question with [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] (bishop of Rome). The [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman province of Asia]] was Quartodeciman, while the Roman and Alexandrian churches continued the fast until the Sunday following (the Sunday of Unleavened Bread), wishing to associate Easter with Sunday. Neither Polycarp nor Anicetus persuaded the other, but they did not consider the matter [[schism (religion)|schismatic]] either, parting in peace and leaving the question unsettled.\n\nControversy arose when [[Pope Victor I|Victor]], bishop of Rome a generation after Anicetus, attempted to excommunicate [[Polycrates of Ephesus]] and all other bishops of Asia for their Quartodecimanism. According to Eusebius, a number of synods were convened to deal with the controversy, which he regarded as all ruling in support of Easter on Sunday.<ref>Eusebius, Church History 5.23.</ref> Polycrates (''circa'' 190), however, wrote to Victor defending the antiquity of Asian Quartodecimanism. Victor's attempted excommunication was apparently rescinded, and the two sides reconciled upon the intervention of bishop [[Irenaeus]] and others, who reminded Victor of the tolerant precedent of Anicetus.\n\nQuartodecimanism seems to have lingered into the 4th century, when [[Socrates of Constantinople]] recorded that some Quartodecimans were deprived of their churches by [[John Chrysostom]]<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'', 6.11, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Of Severian and Antiochus: their Disagreement from John.| work = Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library|date=13 July 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.ix.xii.html| accessdate =28 March 2009}}</ref> and that some were harassed by [[Nestorius]].<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'' 7.29, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Nestorius of Antioch promoted to the See of Constantinople.

But both those who followed the Nisan 14 custom, and those who set Easter to the following Sunday had in common the custom of consulting their Jewish neighbors to learn when the month of Nisan would fall, and setting their festival accordingly. By the later 3rd century, however, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the custom of relying on the Jewish community to determine the date of Easter. The chief complaint was that the Jewish communities sometimes erred in setting Passover to fall before the [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring equinox.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church Histor''y, 7.32.</ref><ref>Peter of Alexandria, quoted in the [[Chronicon Paschale]].

This effectively required the abandonment of the old custom of consulting the Jewish community in those places where it was still used. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote in the mid-4th century:\n\n<blockquote>the emperor&nbsp;... convened a council of 318 bishops&nbsp;... in the city of Nicea&nbsp;... They passed certain ecclesiastical canons at the council besides, and at the same time decreed in regard to the Passover that there must be one unanimous concord on the celebration of God's holy and supremely excellent day.

It took a while for the Alexandrian rules to be adopted throughout Christian Europe, however. The [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] originally employed was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise on the measurement of Easter, after which Rome used his 84-year [[lunisolar calendar]] cycle until 457.

From this time, therefore, all discrepancies between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date for Easter cease, as both churches were using identical tables.\n\nEarly Christians in Britain and Ireland also used an 84-year cycle. From the 5th century onward this cycle set its equinox to 25 March and fixed Easter to the Sunday falling in the 14th to the 20th of the lunar month inclusive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=223\u2013224}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Holford-Strevens, Leofranc|first=and Blackburn, Bonnie|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|pages=870\u2013875}}</ref> This 84-year cycle was replaced by the Alexandrian method in the course of the 7th and 8th centuries. Churches in western continental Europe used a late Roman method until the late 8th century during the reign of [[Charlemagne]], when they finally adopted the Alexandrian method. Since 1582, when the Catholic Church adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] while the Eastern Orthodox and most Oriental Orthodox Churches retained the [[Julian calendar]], the date on which Easter is celebrated has again differed.\n\nThe Greek island of [[Syros]], whose population is divided almost equally between Catholics and Orthodox, is one of the few places where the two Churches share a common date for Easter, with the Catholics accepting the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] date\u2014a practice helping considerably in maintaining good relations between the two communities.<ref>{{cite news| title= Easter: A date with God | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18584376 | date=20 April 2011 | publisher=The Economist | accessdate=23 April 2011| quote= Only in a handful of places do Easter celebrants alter their own arrangements to take account of their neighbours.

The week before Easter, known as [[Holy Week]], is very special in the Christian tradition. The Sunday before Easter is [[Palm Sunday]], with the Wednesday before Easter being known as [[Spy Wednesday]]. The last [[The Three Days|three days]] before Easter are [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] (sometimes referred to as Silent Saturday).\n\nPalm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday respectively commemorate Jesus' entry in Jerusalem, the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Crucifixion]]. Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday are sometimes referred to as the [[Easter Triduum]] ([[Latin]] for \"Three Days\"). Many churches begin celebrating Easter late in the evening of Holy Saturday at a service called the [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nThe week beginning with Easter Sunday is called [[Easter Week]] or the [[Octave of Easter]], and each day is prefaced with \"Easter\", e.g. [[Easter Monday]] (a public holiday in many countries), [[Easter Tuesday]] (a much less widespread public holiday), etc. [[Easter Saturday]] is therefore the Saturday ''after'' Easter Sunday. The day before Easter is properly called Holy Saturday. [[Eastertide]], or Paschaltide, the season of Easter, begins on Easter Sunday and lasts until the day of [[Pentecost]], seven weeks later.\n\n=== Eastern Christianity ===\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], the spiritual preparation for Easter begins with [[Great Lent]], which starts on [[Clean Monday]] and lasts for 40 continuous days (including Sundays). The last week of Great Lent (following the fifth Sunday of Great Lent) is called Palm Week, and ends with [[Lazarus Saturday]]. The [[Vespers]] which begins Lazarus Saturday officially brings Great Lent to a close, although the fast continues through the following week. After Lazarus Saturday comes [[Palm Sunday]], [[Holy Week]], and finally Easter itself, and the fast is broken immediately after the Paschal [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nThe [[Paschal Vigil]] begins with the [[Midnight Office]], which is the last service of the [[Lenten Triodion]] and is timed so that it ends a little before midnight on [[Holy Saturday]] night. At the stroke of midnight the Paschal celebration itself begins, consisting of Paschal [[Matins]], [[Paschal Hours]], and Paschal Divine Liturgy.<ref name=\"Eastern Liturgy\">{{cite web | last = Lash | first = Ephrem (Archimandrite) | title = On the Holy and Great Sunday of Pascha | publisher = Monastery of Saint Andrew the First Called, Manchester, England | date = 25 January 2007 | url = http://www.anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | accessdate = 27 March 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409193104/http://anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | archivedate = 9 April 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Placing the Paschal Divine Liturgy at midnight guarantees that no Divine Liturgy will come earlier in the morning, ensuring its place as the pre-eminent \"Feast of Feasts\" in the [[liturgical year]].\n\nThe liturgical season from Easter to the Sunday of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]) is known as the [[Pentecostarion]] (the \"fifty days\"). The week which begins on Easter Sunday is called [[Bright Week]], during which there is no fasting, even on Wednesday and Friday. The [[Afterfeast]] of Easter lasts 39 days, with its [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] (leave-taking) on the day before [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].

The traditional, [[liturgy|liturgical]] observation of Easter, as practised among Roman Catholics, [[Lutheran]]s, and some [[Anglican]]s begins on the night of [[Holy Saturday]] with the [[Easter Vigil]]. This, the most important liturgy of the year, begins in total darkness with the blessing of the Easter fire, the lighting of the large [[Paschal candle]] (symbolic of the Risen Christ) and the chanting of the [[Exultet]] or Easter Proclamation attributed to Saint [[Ambrose of Milan]].\n\n[[File:Epistle for the Solemn Mass of Easter Day.ogg|thumb|[[Epistle]] reading, [[I Corinthians]] {{Bibleverse-nb|1 Corinthians|5:7\u20138|KJ21}} (in [[Latin]]), for the [[Solemn Mass]] of Easter Day]]\nAfter this service of light, a number of readings from the [[Old Testament]] are read. These tell the stories of [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], the sacrifice of [[Isaac]], the crossing of the [[Red Sea]], and the foretold coming of the [[Messiah]]. This part of the service climaxes with the singing of the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] and the [[Alleluia]] and the proclamation of the [[Gospel]] of the [[resurrection]]. At this time, the lights are brought up and the church bells are rung, according to local custom. A [[sermon]] may be preached after the gospel.\n\nThe focus then moves from the [[lectern]] to the [[Baptismal font|font]]. Anciently, Easter was considered the ideal time for converts to receive [[baptism]], and this practice continues within Roman Catholicism and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Whether there are baptisms at this point or not, it is traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with [[holy water]] from the font. The Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] is also celebrated at the Vigil.\n\nThe Easter Vigil concludes with the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] (known in some traditions as Holy Communion). Certain variations in the Easter Vigil exist: Some churches read the Old Testament lessons before the procession of the Paschal candle, and then read the gospel immediately after the Exsultet.\n\n=== Eastern Christianity ===\n\n[[File:17th-century unknown painters - The Resurrection of Christ - WGA23478.jpg|right|thumb|Icon of the Resurrection by an unknown 17th-century Bulgarian artist]]\nEaster is the fundamental and most important festival of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] Orthodox Churches:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n: This is the Expected and Holy Day,\n: the One among the Sabbaths,\n: the Sovereign and Lady of days,\n: Feast of feasts, Celebration of celebrations,\n: on which we praise Christ for all eternity!\n\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Paskhakustodiev.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Boris Kustodiev]]'s ''Pascha Greetings'' (1912) shows traditional Russian ''[[Paschal greeting|khristosovanie]]'' (exchanging a triple kiss), with such foods as [[Easter eggs|red eggs]], [[kulich]] and [[paskha (dish)|paskha]] in the background.]]\nEvery other religious festival in their calendar, including Christmas, is secondary in importance to the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is reflected in rich Paschal customs in the cultures of countries that have traditionally had an Orthodox Christian majority.

Instead, these events are all seen as necessary but ''preliminary'' to, and illuminated by, the full climax of the Resurrection, in which all that has come before reaches fulfillment and fruition. They shine only in the light of the Resurrection. Easter is the primary act that fulfills the purpose of Christ's ministry on earth\u2014to defeat death by dying and to purify and exalt humanity by voluntarily assuming and overcoming human frailty. This is succinctly summarized by the [[Paschal troparion]], sung repeatedly for forty days, through the [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] of Easter, which is the day before [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n: \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u1f10\u03ba \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd,\n: \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2,\n: \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\n: \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74\u03bd \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n: Christ is risen from the dead,\n: Trampling down death by death,\n: And upon those in the tombs\n: Bestowing life!\n\n</blockquote>\n\nPreparation for Easter begins with the season of [[Great Lent]]. In addition to fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, Orthodox Christians cut down on all entertainment and non-essential worldly activities, gradually eliminating them until [[Good Friday|Great and Holy Friday]], the most austere day of the year. On the evening of [[Holy Saturday|Great and Holy Saturday]], the [[Midnight Office]] commences an hour or two before midnight (see [[Paschal Vigil#Saturday Midnight|paschal vigil]]).\n\n[[File:Kurskaya korennaya.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[Religious Procession in Kursk Province]]'', a controversial painting by [[Ilya Repin]] (1880\u201383), depicting a [[Bright Week]] [[Procession#Outdoors|outdoor procession]].]]\nAt its completion all light in the church building is extinguished, and all wait in darkness and silence for the stroke of midnight. Then, a new flame is struck in the altar, or the priest lights his candle from the [[sanctuary lamp|perpetual lamp]] kept burning there, and he then lights candles held by deacons or other assistants, who then go to light candles held by the congregation (this practice has its origin in the reception of the [[Holy Fire]] at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]]). Then the priest and congregation go in a [[Procession#Outdoors|procession]] around the [[Orthodox church (building)|temple]], holding lit candles, chanting:\n\n<blockquote>\nBy Thy Resurrection O Christ our savior,\nthe angels in Heaven sing,\nenable us who are on Earth,\nto glorify thee in purity of heart.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis procession reenacts the journey of the [[Myrrhbearers]] to the Tomb of Jesus \"very early in the morning\".<ref>{{bibleverse || Luke|24:1|KJV}}</ref> After circling around the temple once or three times, the procession halts in front of the closed doors. In the Greek practice the priest reads a selection from the [[Gospel Book]].<ref>{{bibleverse || Mark|16:1\u20138|KJV}}</ref> Then, in all traditions, the priest makes the [[sign of the cross]] with the censer in front of the closed doors (which represent the sealed tomb).\n\n[[File:Crucession Davidovo-Elizarovo Guslitci Moscow reg 8504.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Traditional Paschal Outdoor Procession during Bright Week by [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]].]]\nHe and the people chant the Paschal Troparion, and all of the [[Church bell|bells]] and [[Semantron|semantra]] are sounded. Then all re-enter the temple and paschal [[matins]] begins immediately, followed by the paschal [[Canonical hours|hours]] and then the paschal [[divine liturgy]]. The [[Paschal Homily]] of [[St. John Chrysostom]] is read at matins.\n\nAfter the [[Dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal of the liturgy]], the priest may bless [[Easter eggs|paschal eggs]] and baskets brought by the faithful containing those foods which have been forbidden during the Great Fast. Immediately after the Liturgy it is customary for the congregation to share a meal, essentially an [[Agape|ag\u00e1p\u0113]] dinner (albeit at 2:00&nbsp;am or later).\n\nIn Greece the traditional meal is ''mageiritsa'', a hearty stew of chopped lamb liver and wild greens seasoned with egg-and-lemon sauce. Traditionally, [[easter eggs]], hard-boiled eggs dyed bright red to symbolize the spilt [[Blood of Christ]] and the promise of eternal life, are cracked together to celebrate the opening of the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]].\n\nThe next morning, Easter Sunday proper, there is no [[Divine Liturgy]], since the liturgy for that day has already been celebrated. Instead, in the afternoon \"[[Agape|Ag\u00e1p\u0113]] [[Vespers]]\" is sung. In this service, it has become customary during the last few centuries for the priest and members of the congregation to read a portion of the [[Gospel of John]] in as many languages as they can manage, to show the universality of the Resurrection.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nFor the remainder of the week, known as \"[[Bright Week]]\", fasting (other than [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|before holy communion]] is suppressed, and the customary [[Paschal greeting]] is: \"Christ is risen!\", to which the response is: \"Truly he is risen!\" This may also be done in many different languages. The services during Bright Week are nearly identical to those on Easter itself, except that they do not take place at midnight, but at their normal times during the day. The outdoor procession during Bright Week takes place either after paschal matins or the paschal divine liturgy.\n\n== Non-observing Christian groups ==\n\n[[File:Croix-sous-neige.jpg|thumb|[[Nonconformist]] Protestant Christians prefer to use a simple [[Christian cross]], rather than a [[crucifix]], to emphasize the Resurrection.]]\nAlong with the celebration of [[Christmas]] and [[Advent]], many Lenten and Easter traditions were altered or even abandoned altogether by various offshoots of the [[Protestant Reformation]], as they were deemed \"[[paganism|pagan]]\" or \"[[Popish]]\" (and therefore tainted) by many of the Reformation's [[Puritan]] movements.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=jmsuoCYAd0IC&pg=PA413&lpg=PA413&dq=easter+pagan+puritan#v=onepage&q=easter%20pagan%20puritan&f=false | title=Guess What I Discovered on the Way to Church? | publisher=Xulon Press | author=Otto, Diane L. | year=2007 | page=413 | isbn=978-1-60266-349-7}}</ref> However, some of the major Reformation Churches and movements ([[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Anglican]] for example), chose to retain a large proportion of the observances of the established [[Church Year]] along with many of its associated traditions.

The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the ''Elements'' was from Proclus, who briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements'' ascribes Euclid as its author.\n\nAlthough best known for its geometric results, the ''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]. It considers the connection between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nThe geometrical system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as ''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]'' that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\n\n===Fragments===\n{{See also|Oxyrhynchus Papyri}}\nThe [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]] (P. Oxy. 29) is a fragment of the second book of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' of Euclid, unearthed by [[Bernard Grenfell|Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt|Hunt]] 1897 in [[Oxyrhynchus]]. More recent scholarship suggests a date of 75\u2013125 AD.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Fowler |year=1999 |title=The Mathematics of Plato's Academy |edition=Second |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-850258-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuwwIdk-xL8C }}</ref>\n\nThe classic translation of [[T.

They follow the same logical structure as ''Elements'', with definitions and proved propositions.\n* ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' deals with the nature and implications of \"given\" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the ''Elements''.\n* ''On Divisions of Figures'', which survives only partially in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given [[ratio]]s. It is similar to a first-century AD work by [[Heron of Alexandria]].\n* ''[[Catoptrics]]'', which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution is held to be anachronistic however by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson who name [[Theon of Alexandria]] as a more likely author.<ref>O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Theon of Alexandria\"</ref>\n* ''Phaenomena'', a treatise on [[spherical astronomy]], survives in Greek; it is quite similar to ''On the Moving Sphere'' by [[Autolycus of Pitane]], who flourished around 310 BC.\n\n[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|20th Century statue by [[Joseph Durham]] in honor of Euclid in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\n* ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by [[Emission theory (vision)|discrete rays which emanate from the eye]]. One important definition is the fourth: \"Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal.\" In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Claudius Ptolemy]].\n\n=== Lost works ===\nOther works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.\n* ''Conics'' was a work on [[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, \"Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics.\" The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.\n* ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.\n* ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary text about errors in [[reasoning]].\n* ''Surface Loci'' concerned either [[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric surfaces]].\n* Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources. ''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity. ''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[Euclid (spacecraft)|Euclid]] [[spacecraft]] was named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Delivers Detectors for ESA's Euclid Spacecraft|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6840|work=NASA|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Axiomatic method]]\n* [[Euclid's orchard]]\n* [[Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[Euclidean geometry]]\n* [[Euclidean relation]]\n* [[Extended Euclidean algorithm]]\n* [[List of topics named after Euclid]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Artmann, Benno (1999).

He is perhaps best known for his 1988 documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', commonly cited among the best and most influential documentaries ever made. In 2003, his [[documentary]] film ''[[The Fog of War|The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara]]'' won the [[76th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMorris was born on February 5, 1948, and raised in a [[Jewish]] family in [[Hewlett, New York|Hewlett]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=September 21, 2012|title=Into Wilderness of Errol|first=Laurie Gwen|last=Shapiro|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/163179/into-wilderness-of-errol/}}</ref>\n\nAfter being treated for [[strabismus]] in childhood, he refused to wear an eye patch. As a consequence, he has limited sight in one eye and lacks normal stereoscopic vision.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/believing-is-seeing-by-errol-morris-book-review.html The New York Times]</ref>\n\nIn the 10th grade, Morris attended [[The Putney School]], a boarding school in Vermont. He began playing the cello, spending a summer in [[France]] studying music under the acclaimed [[Nadia Boulanger]], who also taught Morris's future collaborator [[Philip Glass]]. Describing Morris as a teenager, Mark Singer wrote that he \"read with a passion the fourteen-odd [[List of Oz books|''Oz'' books]], watched a lot of television, and on a regular basis went with a doting but not quite right maiden aunt ('I guess you'd have to say that Aunt Roz was somewhat demented') to Saturday matin\u00e9es, where he saw such films as ''[[This Island Earth]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' \u2014 horror movies that, viewed again 30 years later, still seem scary to him.\"<ref name=\"singer1\">{{cite journal|title=Predilections|last=Singer|first=Mark|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 2, 1989|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html}}</ref>\n\nMorris attended the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Morris graduated in 1969 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history. For a brief time Morris held small jobs, first as a cable television salesman and then as a term-paper writer. His unorthodox approach to applying for grad school included \"trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep.\"<ref name=\"singer1\"/> Having unsuccessfully approached both the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Harvard University]], Morris was able to talk his way into [[Princeton University]], where he began studying the history of science, a topic in which he had \"absolutely no background.\" His concentration was in the history of physics, and he was bored and unsuccessful in the prerequisite physics classes he had to take. This, together with his antagonistic relationship with his advisor [[Thomas Kuhn]] ('You won't even look through my telescope.' And his response was 'Errol, it's not a telescope, it's a kaleidoscope.')<ref name=\"singer1\"/> ensured that his stay at Princeton would be short.\n\nMorris left Princeton in 1972, enrolling at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] as a Ph.D. student in [[philosophy]]. At Berkeley, he once again found that he was not well-suited to his subject. \"Berkeley was just a world of [[pedant]]s. It was truly shocking. I spent two or three years in the philosophy program. I have very bad feelings about it,\" he later said.<ref name=\"singer1\"/> He became a regular at the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Pacific Film Archive]]. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: \"He was a [[film noir]] nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it.\"<ref name=\"singer1\"/>\n\n===Unfinished project on Ed Gein===\nInspired by [[Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', Morris visited [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]] in 1975. While in Wisconsin, he conducted multiple interviews with [[Ed Gein]], the infamous [[serial killer]] who resided at Mendota State Hospital in Madison. He later made plans with German film director [[Werner Herzog]], whom Tom Luddy had introduced to Morris, to return in the summer of 1975 to secretly open the grave of Gein's mother to test their theory that Gein himself had already dug her up. Herzog arrived on schedule, but Morris had second thoughts and was not there. Herzog did not open the grave. Morris later returned to Plainfield, this time staying for almost a year, conducting hundreds of hours of interviews. Although he had plans to either write a book or make a film (which he would call ''Digging up the Past''), Morris never completed his Ed Gein project.\n\nIn the fall of 1976, Herzog visited Plainfield again, this time to shoot part of his film ''[[Stroszek]]''. After the shooting finished, Herzog handed Morris an envelope with cash in it. Morris walked over to the motel window and tossed the envelope, containing about $2,000,  out the window into a parking lot. Herzog went out to the parking lot and brought the money back, again offering it to Morris, saying, \"Please don't do that again.\"<ref name=\"singer1\"/>\n\n===First films===\nMorris accepted the $2,000 from Herzog and used it to take a trip to [[Vernon, Florida]]. Vernon was nicknamed \"Nub City\" because its residents participated in a particularly gruesome form of insurance fraud in which they deliberately amputated a limb in order to collect the insurance money. Morris's second documentary would be about the town and bear its name, although it makes no mention of Vernon as \"Nub City\", but instead explores other idiosyncrasies of the town's residents. Morris made this omission because he received death threats while doing research; the town's residents were afraid that Morris would reveal their secret.<ref name=\"singer1\"/>\n\nAfter spending two weeks in Vernon, Morris returned to Berkeley and began working on a script for a work of fiction that he called ''Nub City''. After a few unproductive months, he happened to read a headline in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that read, \"450 Dead Pets Going To Napa Valley\". Morris left for Napa Valley and began working on the film that would become his first feature, ''[[Gates of Heaven]]''. In 1978, when the film premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a [[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe|short documentary]] by [[Les Blank]]. Herzog had promised to eat his shoe if Morris completed the project, to challenge and encourage Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. At the public shoe-eating, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.<ref name=\"singer1\"/>\n\n''Gates of Heaven'' was given a limited release in the spring of 1981. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] was and remained a champion of the film, including it on his all-time top ten best films list. Morris returned to Vernon in 1979 and again in 1980, renting a house in town and conducting interviews with the town's citizens. ''[[Vernon, Florida (film)|Vernon, Florida]]'' premiered at the 1981 [[New York Film Festival]]. ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it, \"a film as odd and mysterious as its subjects, and quite unforgettable.\" The film, like ''Gates of Heaven'', suffered from poor distribution. It was released on video in 1987, and DVD in 2005.\n\nAfter finishing ''Vernon, Florida'', Morris tried to get funding for a variety of projects. There was ''Road'', a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]], the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of [[Missouri]] bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, \"The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is going wrong in the country. [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without [[the Depression]] as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without [[Vietnam]].\"<ref name=\"singer1\"/> Morris wanted [[Tom Waits]] and [[Mickey Rourke]] to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated [[Stephen King]] adaptations.\n\nIn 1984, Morris married Julia Sheehan, whom he had met in Wisconsin while researching Ed Gein and other serial killers. He would later recall an early conversation with Julia: \"I was talking to a mass murderer but I was thinking of you,\" he said, and instantly regretted it, afraid that it might not have sounded as affectionate as he had wished. But Julia was actually flattered: \"I thought, really, that was one of the nicest things anyone ever said to me. It was hard to go out with other guys after that.\"<ref name=\"singer1\"/>\n\n===''The Thin Blue Line''===\nIn 1985, Morris became interested in Dr. [[James Grigson]], a psychiatrist in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. Under [[Texas]] law, the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] can only be issued if the jury is convinced that the defendant is not only guilty, but will commit further violent crimes in the future if he is not put to death. Grigson had spent 15 years testifying for such cases, and he almost invariably gave the same damning testimony, often saying that it is \"one hundred per cent certain\" that the defendant would kill again.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00375,103386EA575FCA6A.html | title=Expert psychiatric witness was nicknamed Dr. Death | publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |date=June 14, 2004 | first= Pat| last= Gillespie| accessdate =2009-03-21}}</ref> This led to Grigson being nicknamed \"Dr. Death\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ccadp.org/DrDeath.htm |title=Groups Expel Psychiatrist Known for Murder Cases; Witness nicknamed 'Dr. Death' says license won't be affected by allegations |publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |date=July 26, 1995 |first= |last= |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307034749/http://ccadp.org/DrDeath.htm |archivedate=2009-03-07 |df= }}</ref> Through Grigson, Morris would meet the subject of his next film, 36-year-old [[Randall Dale Adams]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00154,101B1DBE87233DDC.html | title=Study: State relies too much on 'killer shrinks' | publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=March 31, 2004| first= | last= | accessdate =2008-03-11}}</ref>\n\nAdams was serving a life sentence that had been commuted from a death sentence on a legal technicality for the 1976 murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams told Morris that he had been framed, and that David Harris, who was present at the time of the murder and was the principal witness for the prosecution, had in fact killed Wood. Morris began researching the case because it related to Dr. Grigson. He was at first unconvinced of Adams's innocence. After reading the transcripts of the trial and meeting David Harris at a bar, however, Morris was no longer so sure.\n\nAt the time, Morris had been making a living as a [[private investigator]] for a well-known private detective agency that specialized in [[Wall Street]] cases. Bringing together his talents as an investigator and his obsessions with murder, narration, and epistemology, Morris went to work on the case in earnest. Unedited interviews in which the prosecution's witnesses systematically contradicted themselves were used as testimony in Adams's 1986 ''[[habeas corpus]]'' hearing to determine if he would receive a new trial. David Harris famously confessed, in a roundabout manner, to killing Wood.\n\nAlthough Adams was finally found innocent after years of being processed by the legal system, the judge in the ''habeas corpus'' hearing officially stated that, \"much could be said about those videotape interviews, but nothing that would have any bearing on the matter before this court.\" Regardless, ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', as Morris's film would be called, was popularly accepted as the main force behind getting its subject, Randall Adams, out of prison. As Morris said of the film, \"''The Thin Blue Line'' is two movies grafted together. On one simple level is the question, Did he do it, or didn't he? And on another level, ''The Thin Blue Line'', properly considered, is an [[Essay#Film|essay]] on false history. A whole group of people, literally everyone, believed a version of the world that was entirely wrong, and my accidental investigation of the story provided a different version of what happened.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/69/articles/2258|title=BOMB Magazine \u2014 Errol Morris by Margot Livesey|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''The Thin Blue Line'' ranks among the most critically acclaimed documentaries ever made. According to a survey by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the film made dozens of critics' top ten lists for 1988, more than any other film that year. It won the documentary of the year award from both the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]]. Despite its widespread acclaim, it was not nominated for an Oscar, which created a small scandal regarding the nomination practices of the Academy. The Academy cited the film's genre of \"non-fiction\", arguing that it was not actually a documentary.\n\n===Commercials===\nAlthough Morris has achieved fame as a documentary filmmaker, he is also an accomplished director of [[television commercial]]s. In 2002, Morris directed a series of television ads for [[Apple Computer]] as part of a popular \"Switch\" campaign. The commercials featured ex-[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users discussing their various bad experiences that motivated their own personal switches to Macintosh. One commercial in the series, starring Ellen Feiss, a high-schooler friend of his son [[Hamilton Morris]], became an Internet meme. Morris has directed hundreds of commercials for various companies and products, including [[Adidas]], [[American International Group|AIG]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Citibank]], [[Kimberly-Clark]]'s [[Depend (undergarment)|Depend brand]], [[Levi's]], [[Miller High Life]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[PBS]], [[The Quaker Oats Company]], [[Southern Comfort]], [[EA Sports]], [[Toyota]] and [[Volkswagen]]. Many of these commercials are available on his website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/commercials.html|title=Errol Morris: Commercials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Morris was commissioned to make a short film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/shortfilms/oscarmovie.html|title=Errol Morris: Short Films|publisher=}}</ref> for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. He was hired based on his advertising resume, not his career as a director of feature-length documentaries. Those interviewed ranged from [[Laura Bush]] to [[Iggy Pop]] to [[Kenneth Arrow]] to Morris's 15-year-old son Hamilton. Morris was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for this short film. He considered editing this footage into a feature-length film, focusing<ref>[http://www.errolmorris.com/content/aborted/projects_donald.html Errolmorris.com]</ref> on [[Donald Trump]] discussing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (this segment was later released on the second issue of ''[[Wholphin (DVD)|Wholphin]]''). Morris went on to make a second short for the [[79th Academy Awards]] in 2007, this time interviewing the various nominees and asking them about their Oscar experiences.\n\nIn 2003, Morris won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Oscar for Best Documentary]] for ''[[The Fog of War]]'', a film about the career of [[Robert S. McNamara]], the [[Secretary of Defense]] during the [[Vietnam War]] under Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In the haunting opening about McNamara's relationship with U.S. General [[Curtis LeMay]] during World War II, Morris brings out complexities in the character of McNamara, which shaped McNamara's positions in the [[Cuban missile crisis]] and the Vietnam War. Like his earlier documentary, ''The Thin Blue Line,'' ''The Fog of War'' included extensive use of re-enactments, a technique which many had believed was inappropriate for documentaries.\n\nIn July 2004, Morris directed another series of commercials in the style of the \"Switch\" ads. This campaign featured [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] who voted for [[George W. Bush|Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] giving their personal reasons for voting for [[John Kerry|Kerry]] in 2004. Upon completing more than 50 commercials, Morris had difficulty getting them on the air. Eventually, the liberal advocacy group [[MoveOn]] [[Political action committee|PAC]] paid to air a few of the commercials. Morris also wrote an editorial<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/editorial/nytimes105.html|title=Errol Morris: Editorial|publisher=}}</ref> for ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussing the commercials and Kerry's losing campaign.\n\nIn late 2004, Morris directed a series of noteworthy commercials for [[Sharp Electronics]]. The commercials enigmatically depicted various scenes from what appeared to be a short narrative that climaxed with a car crashing into a swimming pool. Each commercial showed a slightly different perspective on the events, and each ended with a cryptic weblink. The weblink was to a fake webpage advertising a prize offered to anyone who could discover the secret location of some valuable urns. It was in fact an [[alternate reality game]]. The original commercials can be found on Morris's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/commercials/sharp.html|title=Errol Morris: Commercials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMorris directed a series of commercials for [[Reebok]] that featured six prominent National Football League (NFL) players. The 30-second promotional videos were aired during the 2006 NFL season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football Calls, and Reebok Responds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/24/business/media/24adco.html|accessdate=28 September 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=24 July 2006|author=Jane Levere}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Morris stated that he has made around 1,000 commercials during his career.<ref name=\"Fast\">{{cite web|title=The controversial case of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yd7ltZIqFs|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=28 September 2013|author=FastTheLatestNews|format=Video upload|date=12 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn early 2010, a new Morris documentary was submitted to several film festivals, including [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Cannes Film Festival]], and [[Telluride Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/08/04/bruce-springsteen-errol-morris-and-werner-herzog-in-3-d-as-tiff-unveils-2010-docs/|title=TIFF unveils 2010 docs: Bruce Springsteen, Errol Morris and Werner Herzog in 3D|date=4 August 2010|work=National Post|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708034453/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2010/08/04/bruce-springsteen-errol-morris-and-werner-herzog-in-3-d-as-tiff-unveils-2010-docs/|archivedate=8 July 2012|df=}}</ref> The film, titled ''[[Tabloid (film)|Tabloid]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/03/30/new-details-on-errol-morris-next-documentary-tabloid/|title=New Details on Errol Morris' Next Documentary, TABLOID|work=Collider}}</ref> features interviews with [[Joyce McKinney]], a former [[Miss Wyoming]], who was convicted ''in absentia'' for the kidnap and indecent assault of a [[Mormon sex in chains case|Mormon missionary]] in England during 1977.\n\nMorris has also written long-form journalism, exploring different areas of interest and published on ''The New York Times'' website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/errol-morris/ |title=The New York Times |access-date=2010-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817052951/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/errol-morris/ |archive-date=2010-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> A collection of these essays, titled ''Believing is Seeing: Observations on the Mysteries of Photography,'' was published by Penguin Press on September 1, 2011.

Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Jury Said Jeffrey MacDonald Killed His Wife and Kids.

It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances. And if I can help correct that, I will be a happy camper.\"<ref name=\"Fast\" />\n\n==Style==\nTo conduct interviews, Morris invented a machine, called the '''Interrotron''', which allows Morris and his subject to talk to each other through the camera lens itself. He explains the device as follows:\n\n{{quote|[[Teleprompters]] are used to project an image on a two-way mirror. Politicians and newscasters use them so that they can read text and look into the lens of the camera at the same time. What interests me is that nobody thought of using them for anything other than to display text: read a speech or read the news and look into the lens of the camera. I changed that. I put my face on the Teleprompter or, strictly speaking, my live video image. For the first time, I could be talking to someone, and they could be talking to me and at the same time looking directly into the lens of the camera. Now, there was no looking off slightly to the side. No more faux first person. This was the true first person.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=William|title=Three Documentary Filmmakers: Errol Morris, Ross McElwee, Jean Rouch|date=2009|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|isbn=9781438425016|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the \"aesthetic context\" sense of [[Erik Barnouw]]'s ''Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film'', Morris is a multiple stylist. His \"Prosecutor\"-style ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|Thin Blue Line]]'' influenced legal process and led to [[Randall Adams]]'s release. He uses the \"Chronicler\" style for big events and the \"Observer\" style for given-moment events. He is best known for the \"Catalyst\" style that is seen as direct, natural, and cinematically truthful, as no directorial voice-over or \"voice\" is heard among the voices of others.<ref>Barnouw, Erik. ''Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film'', Oxford University Press, London: 1993.</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2014}}\n\nMorris employs the use of narrative elements within his films. These include but are not limited to: stylized lighting, musical score, and re-enactment. The use of these elements is rejected by many documentary filmmakers who followed the cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style of the previous generations. Cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 is characterized by its rejection of artistic additions to documentary film. While Morris faced backlash from many of the older-era filmmakers, his style has been embraced by the younger generations of filmmakers, as the use of re-enactment is present in many contemporary documentary films.\n\nMorris advocates the reflexive style of documentary filmmaking. In [[Bill Nichols]]'s book ''Introduction to Documentary'' he states that reflexive documentary \"[speaks] not only about the historical world but about the problems and issues of representing it as well.\" Morris uses his films not only to portray social issues and non-fiction events but also to comment on the reliability of documentary making itself.<ref>Nichols, Bill.

The first change offsets the date by 11 days.  The second is that, at the time of Allen's birth, the New Year began on March 25.  As a result, while his birth is officially recorded as happening on January 10, 1737, conversions due to these changes make the date in the modern calendar January 21, 1738. Adjusting for the movement of the New Year to January changes the year to 1738; adjusting for the Gregorian calendar changes the date from January 10 to 21. See [[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 2 and [[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], p. 5.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 February 12, 1789) was a farmer, businessman, land speculator, philosopher, writer, [[lay theologian]],  [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]], and politician. He is best known as one of the founders of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]], and for the [[capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] early in the [[American Revolutionary War]] along with [[Benedict Arnold]]. He was the brother of [[Ira Allen]] and the father of [[Fanny Allen|Frances Allen]].\n\nBorn in rural [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], Allen had a frontier upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he became interested in the [[New Hampshire Grants]], buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks led to the formation of the [[Green Mountain Boys]], whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured [[Fort Ticonderoga]] in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed [[Battle of Longue-Pointe|attempt on Montreal]] that resulted in his capture by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] authorities. First imprisoned aboard [[Royal Navy]] ships, he was paroled in [[New York City]], and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.\n\nUpon his release, Allen returned to the Grants, which had [[Vermont Republic|declared independence]] in 1777, and resumed political activity in the territory. In addition to continuing resistance to New York's attempts to assert control over the territory, Allen was active in efforts by Vermont's leadership for recognition by [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]], and he participated in [[Haldimand Affair|controversial negotiations]] with the British over the possibility of Vermont becoming a separate British province.\n\nAllen wrote accounts of his exploits in the war that were widely read in the 19th century, as well as philosophical treatises and documents relating to the politics of Vermont's formation. His business dealings included successful farming operations, one of [[Connecticut]]'s early iron works, and land speculation in the Vermont territory. Land purchased by Allen and his brothers included tracts of land that eventually became [[Burlington, Vermont]]. He was twice married, fathering eight children.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:PostcardLitchfieldCTEthanAllenBirthplace1916.jpg|thumb|A postcard depicting Allen's birthplace in [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], [[Connecticut]]]]\n\n===Childhood===\nEthan Allen was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen, both descended from [[English American|English]] Puritans.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], p. 11</ref> The family moved to the town of [[Cornwall, Connecticut|Cornwall]] shortly after his birth. The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen's father's quest for freedom of religion during a time of turmoil: the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]], when [[Puritan]]s were separating into churches with differing dogmas, in particular about the proper form of conversion: by works or by grace. His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father's refusal to convert to the covenant by grace.<ref>[[#Randall2011|Randall (2011)]], pp. 59\u201360, 72\u201378, 89\u201389</ref> As a boy Allen already excelled at quoting the Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages.<ref>[[#Randall2011|Randall (2011)]], pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nSeven siblings, all of whom survived to adulthood, joined the family between Allen's birth in 1738 and 1751.<ref>[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 9</ref> Allen had five brothers (Heman, Heber, Levi, Zimri, and [[Ira Allen|Ira]]) and two sisters (Lydia and Lucy). His brothers [[Ira Allen|Ira]] and [[Heman Allen (of Cornwall)|Heman]] would also become prominent figures in the early history of Vermont.<ref name=\"Jellison3\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 3</ref>\n\nAlthough not very much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was frontier territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; at the time of his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town [[selectman]].<ref name=\"B8\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 8</ref> Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] with the goal of gaining admission to [[Yale University|Yale College]]. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.<ref name=\"Jellison5\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 5</ref>\n\n===First marriage and early adulthood===\nAllen was forced to end his studies upon his father's death. While he volunteered for militia service in 1757 in response to French movements resulting in the [[siege of Fort William Henry]], his unit received word while en route that the fort had fallen, and turned back.<ref name=\"Jellison7\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 7</ref> Even though the [[French and Indian War]] continued over the next several years, Allen did not apparently participate in any further military activities, and is presumed to have tended his farm, at least until 1762. In that year, he became part owner of an [[blast furnace|iron furnace]] in Salisbury.<ref name=\"Hall12_3\">[[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], pp. 12\u201313</ref> He also married Mary Brownson, a woman five years his senior, from the nearby town of [[Roxbury, Connecticut|Roxbury]], in July 1762. They first settled in Cornwall, but moved the following year to Salisbury with their infant daughter Loraine. Allen bought a small farm and proceeded to develop the iron works.<ref name=\"Jellison8_9\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 8\u20139</ref> The expansion of the iron works was apparently costly to Allen; he was forced to sell off portions of the Cornwall property to raise funds, and eventually sold half of his interest in the works to his brother Heman.<ref name=\"Jellison9\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 9</ref> The Allen brothers sold their interest in the iron works in October of 1765.<ref>[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 22</ref>\n\nBy most accounts Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and barely able to read and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning.<ref name=\"Jellison8\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 8</ref> In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.<ref>[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 241</ref>\n\nAllen's exploits in those years introduced him to the wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages.<ref name=\"Jellison10_1\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 10\u201311</ref> He was also called to court in Salisbury for [[inoculation|inoculating]] himself against [[smallpox]], a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.<ref name=\"Jellison12\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 12</ref>\n\n===Thomas Young===\nWhen he moved to Salisbury, Allen met [[Thomas Young (American revolutionary)|Thomas Young]], a doctor living and practicing just across the provincial boundary in [[Province of New York|New York]]. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen a great deal about philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a [[Deism|Deist]]. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.<ref name=\"Jellison15_7\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIt was not until many years later, after Young's death, that Allen was able to recover the manuscript. He expanded and reworked the material, and eventually published it as ''Reason: the Only Oracle of Man''.<ref name=\"Holbrook194_225\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], pp. 194\u2013195, 225</ref>\n\n===Moving around===\nWhile Heman remained in Salisbury, where he ran a general store until his death in 1778, Allen's movements over the next few years are poorly documented.<ref name=\"Jellison30\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 30</ref> He is known to have been living in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] in the spring of 1766, where his son Joseph was born, and where he invested in a lead mine.<ref name=\"Randall157\">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 157</ref> He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities; while no official reason is known, biographer [[Michael Bellesiles]] suggests that religious differences and Allen's tendency to be disruptive may have played a role in his departure.<ref name=\"B23\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 23</ref> He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby [[Sheffield, Massachusetts]] with his younger brother Zimri. It is likely that his first visits to the [[New Hampshire Grants]] occurred during these years. While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years, Allen was often absent for extended periods.<ref name=\"Jellison31\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 31</ref>\n\n==The New Hampshire Grants==\n{{See also|New Hampshire Grants}}\n[[File:Governor Benning Wentworth.jpg|thumb|upright|New Hampshire Governor [[Benning Wentworth]]]]\nAs early as 1749, [[Benning Wentworth]], [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]'s governor, was selling land grants in the area west of the [[Connecticut River]], to which New Hampshire had always laid somewhat dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|kicked back]] to Wentworth. In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York.<ref name=\"B28_32\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], pp. 28\u201332</ref> New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, and many of the holders were land-rich and cash-poor, there was a great deal of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.<ref name=\"Jellison20_6\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 20\u201326</ref>\n\n===Allen asked for assistance===\nA few of the holders of Wentworth grants were originally from northwestern Connecticut; and some of them, including [[Remember Baker]] and [[Seth Warner]], were relatives of Allen. In 1770, a group of Wentworth grant holders asked Allen to defend their case before New York's Supreme Court, a move that presented Allen with his first big stage.<ref name=\"Jellison31\"/> This move to leadership was not unusual; he was known among his contemporaries to be willing to step forward and take control.<ref name=\"Jellison32\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 32</ref> The trial, for which Allen hired [[Jared Ingersoll]] to represent the grantholder interest, began in July 1770, pitting Allen against politically powerful New York grant-holders, including New York's Lieutenant Governor [[Cadwallader Colden|Colden]], [[James Duane]] (who was prosecuting the case), and [[Robert Livingston (1708\u20131790)|Robert Livingston]], the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (who was presiding over the case). The trial was brief, and the outcome unsurprising, as the court, citing their fraudulently issued nature, refused to allow the introduction of Wentworth's grants as evidence.<ref name=\"Hall26_7\">[[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], pp. 26\u201327</ref> Before departing for Bennington with the news, Allen was visited by Duane, who offered Allen payments which Duane described in his diary as payment \"for going among the people to quiet them\".<ref name=\"Jellison37\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 37</ref> Allen denied taking any money; even if he did, none of his actions appeared to honor Duane's request.<ref name=\"Jellison37\"/> According to Allen's account he was outraged, and left his visitors with veiled threats, indicating that attempts to enforce the judgment would be met with resistance.<ref name=\"Jellison38\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 38</ref>\n\n[[File:Catamount2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Catamount Tavern]], late in the 19th century]]\nWhile many historians have believed that Allen took these actions because he already held Wentworth grants of his own, there is no evidence that he was issued any such grants until after he had been asked to take up the defense of grants held by others. Between May 1770, when he first began working on the defense, and the trial in July, he acquired, for the price of $50, grants from Wentworth to about {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} of land in [[Poultney, Vermont|Poultney]] and [[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]].<ref name=\"B33_4\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\n===Green Mountain Boys===\nOn Allen's return to Bennington, the settlers met at the [[Catamount Tavern]] to discuss their options. These discussions resulted in the formation of the [[Green Mountain Boys]] in 1770, with local militia companies in each of the surrounding towns. Allen was named their Colonel Commandant, and cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker were captains of two of the companies.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], p. 27</ref> Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority. These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey ''any'' land in the Grants, not just land owned through the Wentworth grants.<ref name=\"Jellison50\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 50</ref>\n\n[[File:GreenMtBoys.jpg|thumb|left|The flag of the [[Green Mountain Boys]]]]\nWhile Allen participated in some of the actions to drive surveyors away, he also spent much time exploring the entire territory, probably ranging as far north as the site of Burlington in his wanderings. After selling off some of his Connecticut properties, he began buying wild lands farther north in the territory, which he sold at a profit as the southern settlements grew and people began to move farther north.<ref name=\"Jellison56_7\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nFriction with the provincial government rose notably when, in October 1771, Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near [[Rupert, Vermont|Rupert]]. Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly constructed cabins. He then ordered them to leave, saying, \"Go your way now, and complain to that damned scoundrel your Governor, God damn your Governor, Laws, King, Council, and Assembly\".<ref name=\"Holbrook50\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 50</ref>  When the settlers protested his language Allen continued the tirade, threatening to send any troops from New York to Hell. In response, New York's governor, [[William Tryon]], issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible, and eventually put a price of \u00a320 on the heads of six participants, including Allen.<ref name=\"Holbrook50\"/> Allen and his comrades countered by issuing offers of their own.\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|\u00a325 REWARD\u2014Whereas James Duane and John Kempe, of New York, have by their menaces and threats greatly disturbed the public peace and repose of the honest peasants of Bennington and the settlements to the northward, which are now and ever have been in the peace of God and the King, and are patriotic and liege subjects of Geo. the 3rd. Any person that will apprehend these common disturbers, viz: James Duane and John Kempe, and bring them to Landlord Fay's at Bennington shall have \u00a315 reward James Duane and \u00a310 reward for John Kempe, paid by|Ethan Allen, Remember Baker, Robert Cochran<ref name=\"Jellison62\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 62</ref>}}\n\nOver the next few years the situation deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to \u00a3100.<ref name=\"Jellison62_91\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 62\u201391</ref>\n\n===Onion River Company===\nAllen persisted with actions against the New York-issued grantholders and their tenants even though a number of the Wentworth proprietors were tiring of the business. In 1772 he, his cousin Remember Baker; and his brothers Ira, Heman, and Zimri formed the Onion River Company, which was basically a land-speculation organization devoted to purchasing land in and around the [[Winooski River]] (known then as the Onion River). The success of this business depended on the successful defense of the Wentworth grants. Early purchases of the company included about {{convert|40000|acre|ha}} of land from Edward Burling and his partners; land was sold at a profit to [[Thomas Chittenden]] among others, and the settlements on the company's land have grown to become the city of Burlington.<ref name=\"Jellison77_86\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 77\u201386</ref>\n\nThe outrage of the Wentworth proprietors was renewed in 1774 when Governor Tryon passed a law containing harsh provisions clearly targeted at the actions of the \"Bennington Mob\".<ref name=\"Jellison92\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 92</ref><ref name=\"Nelson108\">[[#Nelson|Nelson (1990)]], p. 108</ref> Vermont historian Samuel Williams called it \"an act which for its savage barbarity is probably without parallel in the legislation of any civilized country\".<ref name=\"Jellison92\"/>  Its provisions included the penalty of death for interfering with a magistrate, and the criminalization of meetings of more than three people \"for unlawful purposes\" in the Grants.<ref name=\"Jellison92\"/> The Boys countered with rules of their own, forbidding anyone in the Grants from holding \"any office of honor or profit under the colony of N. York\".<ref name=\"Jellison94\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 94</ref>\n\nAllen spent much of the summer of 1774 writing a \"pamphlet\" entitled ''A Brief Narrative of the Proceedings of the Government of New York Relative to Their Obtaining the Jurisdiction of that Large District of Land to the Westward of the Connecticut River''. The length of the name was justified; it was a 200-page polemic arguing the position of the Wentworth proprietors.<ref name=\"Jellison94_5\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp 94\u201395</ref> Allen had the work, which historian Charles Jellison describes as \"rebellion in print\", printed in Connecticut, and began selling and giving away copies in early 1775.<ref name=\"Jellison96\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 96</ref>\n\n===Westminster massacre===\n{{main article|Westminster massacre}}\nAllen traveled into the northern parts of the Grants early in 1775, as was his custom, for solitude and to hunt for game and land opportunities.<ref name=\"Jellison97\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 97</ref> A few days after his return, news came that blood had finally been shed over the land disputes. Most of the resistance activity had until then taken place on the west side of the [[Green Mountains]]; on March 13, [[Westminster massacre|a small riot]] in the [[shire town]] of [[Westminster (town), Vermont|Westminster]], on the east side of the mountains, resulted in the death of two men.<ref name=\"Holbrook85\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 85</ref> Allen and a troop of Boys traveled to Westminster where, under Allen's influence, the town's convention adopted a strongly worded resolution authorizing the drafting of a plea to the King to remove them \"out of so oppressive a jurisdiction\".<ref name=\"Jellison99_0\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 99\u2013100</ref> The preparation of the petition was assigned to a committee which included Allen.<ref name=\"Holbrook86\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 86</ref> Less than a week after the Westminster convention ended, while Allen and the committee worked on their petition, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began.<ref name=\"B113\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 113</ref>\n\n==Revolutionary War==\n\n===Capture of Fort Ticonderoga===\n{{Main article|Capture of Fort Ticonderoga}}\nIn late April, following the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]], Allen received a message from members of an irregular Connecticut militia that they were planning to [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|capture Fort Ticonderoga]], requesting his assistance in the effort.<ref name=\"Jellison109\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 109</ref>  Allen, whether motivated by patriotic impulses (as he describes in his account of the events), or by the realization that the action might improve the political position of his side in the grants disputes, agreed to help, and began rounding up the Green Mountain Boys.<ref name=\"B116\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 116</ref> On May 2, 60 men from Massachusetts and Connecticut met with Allen in Bennington, where they discussed the logistics of the expedition.<ref name=\"Jellison109\"/> By May 7, these men joined Allen and 130 Boys at Castleton. The next morning, Allen was elected to lead the expedition, and a dawn raid was planned for May 10.<ref name=\"Jellison110\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 110</ref> Two small companies were detached to procure boats, and Allen took the main contingent north to Hand's Cove in [[Shoreham, Vermont|Shoreham]] to prepare for the crossing.<ref name=\"Jellison111\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 111</ref>\n\n[[File:Benedict arnold illustration.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Engraving of [[Benedict Arnold]]]]\nOn the afternoon of May 9, [[Benedict Arnold]] quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene. Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would follow only Allen's lead. In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would both be at the front of the troops when the attack on the fort was made.<ref name=\"Randall90\">[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 90</ref>\n\nAround 2:00&nbsp;a.m., a few boats were finally procured for the crossing. However, only 83 men made it to the other side of the lake before Allen and Arnold, concerned that dawn was approaching, decided to attack.<ref name=\"Jellison115\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 115</ref> In the early dawn, the small force marched on the fort, surprising the lone sentry. Allen went directly to the fort commander's quarters, seeking to force his surrender.  Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain.<ref name=\"Randall95\">[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 95</ref> Stalling for time, he demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, said, \"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\"<ref name=\"Randall96\">[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 96</ref> Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers, fully dressed, and surrendered his sword.<ref name=\"Randall96\"/> The rest of the fort's garrison surrendered without firing a shot.<ref name=\"B118\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 118</ref> The only casualty had been a British soldier who became concussed after Allen hit the soldier with a cutlass, hitting the man's hair comb and saving his life.<ref name=\"Randall307\">[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 307</ref>\n\n===Raids on St. John===\nOn the following day, a detachment of the Boys under Seth Warner's command went to nearby [[Fort Crown Point]] and captured the small garrison there.<ref name=\"B118\"/> On May 14, following the arrival of 100 men recruited by Arnold's captains, and the arrival of a [[schooner]] and some [[bateaux]] that had been taken at [[Whitehall (village), New York|Skenesboro]], Arnold and 50 of his men sailed north to raid [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort St. John]], on the [[Richelieu River]] downstream from the lake, where a small British warship was reported by the prisoners to be anchored.<ref name=\"Randall101\">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 101</ref><ref name=\"Smith155\">[[#Smith14I|Smith (1907)]], p. 155</ref> Arnold's raid was a success; he seized the sloop [[HMS Royal George (1776)|HMS ''Royal George'']], supplies, and a number of bateaux.<ref name=\"Smith157\">[[#Smith14I|Smith (1907)]], p. 157</ref>\n\nAllen, shortly after Arnold's departure on the raid, decided, after his successes at the southern end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north.<ref name=\"Jellison130\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 130</ref> After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake.<ref name=\"Randall105\">[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 105</ref> Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.<ref name=\"Jellison129_0\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 129\u2013130</ref>\n\nWhen Allen and his men landed above St. John and scouted the situation, they learned that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which significantly outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew to the other side of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took.<ref name=\"Jellison130_1\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 130\u2013131</ref> The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some{{who|date=October 2016}} even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Promoting an invasion===\nFollowing Allen's failed attempt on St. John, many of his men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm. Arnold then began asserting his authority over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Allen publicly announced that he was stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the [[Second Continental Congress]] was going to name \"a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit\".<ref name=\"Jellison132\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 132</ref> Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open.<ref name=\"B121\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 121</ref> They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that \"I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take [[Montreal]]\".<ref name=\"Jellison134\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 134</ref> Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.<ref name=\"Jellison135_7\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 135\u2013137</ref>\n\nOn June 22, Allen and Seth Warner appeared before Congress in Philadelphia, where they argued for the inclusion of the Green Mountain Boys in the [[Continental Army]]. After deliberation, Congress directed General [[Philip Schuyler]], who had been appointed to lead the Army's Northern Department, to work with New York's provincial government to establish (and pay for) a regiment consisting of the Boys, and that they be paid Army rates for their service at Ticonderoga.<ref name=\"B122\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 122</ref> On July 4, Allen and Warner made their case to New York's Provincial Congress, which, despite the fact that the Royal Governor had placed a price on their heads, agreed to the formation of a regiment.<ref name=\"Holbrook99\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 999</ref> Following a brief visit to their families, they returned to Bennington to spread the news. Allen went to Ticonderoga to join Schuyler, while Warner and others raised the regiment.<ref name=\"Jellison141\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 141</ref>\n\n===Allen loses command of the Boys===\nWhen the regimental companies in the Grants had been raised, they held a vote in [[Dorset, Vermont|Dorset]] to determine who would command the regiment. By a wide margin, Seth Warner was elected to lead the regiment. Brothers Ira and Heman were also given command positions, but Allen was not given any position at all in the regiment.<ref name=\"Smith255\">[[#Smith14I|Smith (1907)]], p. 255</ref> The thorough rejection stung; Allen wrote to Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]], \"How the old men came to reject me I cannot conceive inasmuch as I saved them from the incroachments of New York.\"<ref name=\"B144\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 144</ref>\n\n[[File:EthanAllenBeforePrescott1775.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Engraving depicting Allen before his captors in [[Montreal]]]]\nThe rejection likely had several causes. The people of the Grants were tired of the disputes with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, the failure of the attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader.<ref name=\"Jellison144\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 144</ref> Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at [[Battle of Hubbardton|Hubbardton]] and [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]]) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting.<ref name=\"Jellison145\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 145</ref> In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.<ref name=\"B144\"/>\n\n===Capture===\n{{See also|Invasion of Canada (1775)|Battle of Longue-Pointe}}\n\nThe American invasion of [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Quebec]] departed from Ticonderoga on August 28. On September 4, the army had occupied the [[\u00cele aux Noix]] in the Richelieu River, a few miles above Fort St. John, which they then [[Siege of Fort St. Jean|prepared to besiege]].<ref name=\"Smith322_4\">[[#Smith14I|Smith (1907)]], pp. 322\u2013324</ref> On September 8, Schuyler sent Allen and Massachusetts Major [[John Brown of Pittsfield|John Brown]], who had also been involved in the capture of Ticonderoga, into the countryside between St. John and Montreal to spread the word of their arrival to the [[habitant]]s and the Indians.<ref name=\"Lanctot65\">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], p. 65</ref> They were successful enough in gaining support from the habitants that Quebec's governor, General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], reported that \"they have injured us very much\".<ref name=\"Jellison151\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 151</ref>\n\nWhen he returned from that expedition eight days later, Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] had assumed command of the invasion due to Schuyler's illness. Montgomery, likely not wanting the troublemaker in his camp, again sent him out, this time to raise a regiment of French-speaking [[Canadien]]s. Accompanied by a small number of Americans, he again set out, traveling through the countryside to [[Sorel, Quebec|Sorel]], before turning to follow the [[Saint Lawrence River]] up toward Montreal, recruiting upwards of 200 men.<ref name=\"B126\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 126</ref>\n\nOn September 24, he and Brown, whose company was guarding the road between St. John's and Montreal, met at [[Longueuil, Quebec|Longueuil]], and, according to Allen's account of the events, came up with a plan in which both he and Brown would lead their forces to attack Montreal. Allen and about 100 men crossed the Saint Lawrence that night, but Brown and his men, who were to cross the river at [[Laprairie, Quebec|Laprairie]], did not. General Carleton, alerted to Allen's presence, mustered every man he could, and, in the [[Battle of Longue-Pointe]], scattered most of Allen's force, and captured him and about 30 men. His capture ended his participation in the revolution until 1778, as he was imprisoned by the British.<ref name=\"Lanctot77_8\">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot (1967)]], pp. 77\u201378</ref> General Schuyler, upon learning of Allen's capture, wrote, \"I am very apprehensive of disagreeable consequences arising from Mr. Allen's imprudence.

Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the men should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Jellison162_4\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nIn January 1776, Allen and his men were put on board HMS ''Soledad'', which sailed for [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]]. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a collection to provide him and his men with clothing and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jellison165\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 165</ref> Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS ''[[HMS Mercury (1756)|Mercury]]'', she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained [[William Tryon]]; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor knew who he was.<ref name=\"Jellison167\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 167</ref> In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and [[scurvy]] was rampant.<ref name=\"Holbrook122\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 122</ref> By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole.<ref name=\"Jellison170\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 170</ref> With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777.<ref name=\"Boatner17\">[[#Boatner|Boatner]], pp. 17\u201318</ref> He then learned of the death of his young son Joseph due to [[smallpox]].<ref name=\"Holbrook126\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 126</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=25%|His fortitude and firmness seem to have placed him out of reach of misfortune.

Allen stayed there for two days and was treated politely. On the third day Allen was exchanged for Colonel [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], who was conducted to the exchange by Colonel [[Elias Boudinot]], the American [[commissary general]] of prisoners appointed by General [[George Washington]]. Following the exchange, Allen reported to Washington at [[Valley Forge]]. On May 14, he was [[brevet (military)|breveted]] a colonel in the Continental Army in \"reward of his fortitude, firmness and zeal in the cause of his country, manifested during his long and cruel captivity, as well as on former occasions,\"<ref name=\"Boatner17\"/> and given military pay of $75 per month. The brevet rank, however, meant that there was no active role, until called, for Allen. Allen's services were never requested, and eventually the payments stopped.<ref name=\"Jellison179\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 179</ref>\n\n==Vermont Republic==\n\n===Return home===\nFollowing his visit to Valley Forge, Allen traveled to Salisbury, arriving on May 25, 1778. There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week, and that his brother Zimri, who had been caring for Allen's family and farm, had died in the spring following his capture. The death of Heman, with whom Allen had been quite close, hit him quite hard.<ref name=\"Jellison180_1\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 180\u2013181</ref>\n\nHe then set out for Bennington, where news of his impending return preceded him, and he was met with all of the honor due a military war hero.<ref name=\"Holbrook137\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 137</ref> There he learned that the [[Vermont Republic]] had declared independence in 1777, that a constitution had been drawn up, and that elections had been held.<ref name=\"Jellison181\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 181</ref> Allen wrote of this homecoming that \"we passed the flowing bowl, and rural felicity, sweetened with friendship, glowed in every countenance\".<ref name=\"Jellison187\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 187</ref> The next day he went to [[Arlington, Vermont|Arlington]] to see his family and his brother Ira, whose prominence in Vermont politics had risen considerably during Allen's captivity.<ref name=\"Jellison188\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 188</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:George Clinton, engraved by John Chester Buttre.jpg|thumb|upright|New York Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]]]\nAllen spent the next several years involved in Vermont's political and military matters. While his family remained in Arlington, he spent most of his time either in Bennington or on the road, where he could avoid his wife's nagging.<ref name=\"Jellison194\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 194</ref> Shortly after his arrival, Vermont's Assembly passed the [[Banishment Act (Vermont)|Banishment Act]], a sweeping measure allowing for the confiscation and auction by the republic of property owned by known [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]]. Allen was appointed to be one of the judges responsible for deciding whose property was subject to seizure under the law. (This law was so successful at collecting revenue that Vermont did not impose any taxes until 1781.)<ref name=\"Holbrook140\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 140</ref> Allen personally escorted some of those convicted under the law to Albany, where he turned them over to General [[John Stark]] for transportation to the British lines. Some of these supposed Tories protested to New York Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] that they were actually dispossessed Yorkers. Clinton, who considered Vermont to still be a part of New York, did not want to honor the actions of the Vermont tribunals; Stark, who had custody of the men, disagreed with Clinton. Eventually the dispute made its way to George Washington, who essentially agreed with Stark since he desperately needed the general's services. The prisoners were eventually transported to [[West Point, New York|West Point]], where they remained in \"easy imprisonment\".<ref name=\"Jellison198_0\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 198\u2013200</ref>\n\nWhile Allen's service as a judge in Vermont was brief, he continued to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release while he was in Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there and furnished him with goods and money.<ref name=\"Jellison200_1\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 200\u2013201</ref> Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the ''[[Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]'', even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.<ref name=\"Jellison203\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 203</ref>\n\nEarly in 1779, Governor Clinton issued a proclamation stating that the state of New York would honor the Wentworth grants, if the settlers would recognize New York's political jurisdiction over the Vermont territory. Allen wrote another pamphlet in response, entitled ''An {{sic|Animad|versory}} Address to the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont; with Remarks on a Proclamation under the Hand of his Excellency George Clinton, Esq; Governor of the State of New York''. In typical style, he castigated the governor for issuing \"romantic proclamations ... calculated to deceive woods people\", and for his \"folly and stupidity\".<ref name=\"Jellison205\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 205</ref> Clinton's response, once he recovered his temper, was to issue another proclamation little different from the first. Allen's pamphlet circulated widely, including among members of Congress, and was successful in casting the Vermonters' case in a positive light.<ref name=\"Jellison206\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 206</ref>\n\nIn 1779 Allen published the account of his time in captivity, ''A Narrative of Colonel Ethan Allen's Captivity ... Containing His Voyages and Travels, With the most remarkable Occurrences respecting him and many other Continental Prisoners of Observations. Written by Himself and now published for the Information of the Curious in all Nations''. First published as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] by the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'', the book was an instant best-seller;<ref name=Holbrook158_9>[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], pp. 158\u201359</ref> it is still available today.

He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont.<ref>[[#Hemenway|Hemenway]], p. 941</ref> Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor [[Thomas Chittenden]], and others, in [[Vermont Negotiations|negotiations]] with [[Frederick Haldimand]], the governor of [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Quebec]], that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British [[province]] and gaining military protection for its residents.<ref name=treason>Vermont Historical Society, pp. 83\u2013330, covers much of these negotiations and their political consequences.</ref> The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous,<ref>Vermont Historical Society, p. 220</ref> but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.<ref name=treason/>\n\n==Later years==\nAs the war had ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], and the United States, operating under the [[Articles of Confederation]], resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined.<ref name=\"Jellison301\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 301</ref> Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.<ref name=\"Jellison302\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 302</ref>\n\nIn 1782, Allen's brother Heber died at the relatively young age of 38. Allen's wife Mary died in June 1783 of [[Tuberculosis#Other names|consumption]], to be followed several months later by their first-born daughter Loraine. While they had not always been close, and Allen's marriage had often been strained, Allen felt these losses deeply. A poem he wrote memorializing Mary was published in the ''Bennington Gazette''.<ref name=\"Jellison303\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 303</ref>\n\n===Publication of ''Reason''===\n[[File:Ethan Allen book.jpg|thumb|right|Allen's 'Reason' at CFI's Library|Allen's 'Reason', at [[Center for Inquiry|CFI's Library]]]]In these years, Allen recovered from Thomas Young's widow, who was living in Albany, the manuscript that he and Young had worked on in his youth and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as ''Reason: the Only Oracle of Man''. The work was a typical Allen polemic, but its target was religious, not political. Specifically targeted against [[Christianity]], it was an unbridled attack against the [[Bible]], established churches, and the powers of the priesthood. As a replacement for organized religion, he espoused a mixture of [[deism]], [[Spinoza]]'s naturalist views, and precursors of [[Transcendentalism]], with man acting as a free agent within the natural world. While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work, the writing contains clear indications of Allen's style.<ref name=\"Jellison305_8\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 305\u201308</ref>\n\n[[File:Statue of Ethan Allen by Larkin Goldsmith Mead.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sculpture of Allen by [[Larkin Goldsmith Mead]]]]\nThe book was a complete financial and critical failure. Allen's publisher had forced him to pay the publication costs up front, and only 200 of the 1,500 volumes printed were sold. (The rest were eventually destroyed by a fire at the publisher's house.) The theologically conservative future president of [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], opined that \"the style was crude and vulgar, and the sentiments were coarser than the style.  The arguments were flimsy and unmeaning, and the conclusions were fastened upon the premises by mere force.\"<ref name=\"Jellison310\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 310</ref> Allen took the financial loss and the criticism in stride, observing that most of the critics were clergymen, whose livelihood he was attacking.<ref name=\"Jellison311\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 311</ref>\n\n===Second marriage===\nAllen met his second wife, a young [[widow]] named Frances \"Fanny\" Montresor Brush Buchanan, early in 1784; and after a brief courtship, they wed on February 16, 1784. Fanny came from a notably [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] background (including [[Crean Brush]], notorious for acts during the [[Siege of Boston]], from whom she inherited land in Vermont), but they were both smitten, and the marriage was a happy one.<ref name=\"Jellison314_5\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 314\u2013315</ref> They had three children: [[Fanny Allen|Fanny]] (1784\u20131819),<ref>[[#Goesbriand|Goesbriand]], p. 12</ref> Hannibal Montresor (1786\u20131813), and Ethan Alphonso (1789\u20131855).<ref>[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 279</ref> Fanny had a settling effect on Allen; for the remainder of his years he did not embark on many great adventures.<ref name=\"Jellison315\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 315</ref>\n\nThe notable exception to this was when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the [[Wyoming Valley]], in an area that is now [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"B248\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 248</ref> The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York.<ref name=\"Holbrook217_9\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], pp. 217\u2013219</ref> The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.<ref name=\"B251\">[[#Bellesiles|Bellesiles]], p. 251</ref>\n\nAllen was also approached by [[Daniel Shays]] in 1786 for support in what became the [[Shays's Rebellion]] in western Massachusetts. He was unsupportive of the cause, in spite of Shays's offer to crown him \"king of Massachusetts\"; he felt that Shays was just trying to erase unpayable debts.<ref name=\"Holbrook243\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 243</ref>\n\nIn his later years, independent Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold a great deal of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land. A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further exacerbated by the cost of publishing ''Reason'', and of the construction of a new home near the mouth of the Onion River.<ref name=\"Jellison320\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 320</ref> He was threatened with debtors' prison on at least one occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.<ref name=\"Holbrook221\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 221</ref><ref name=\"Jellison321\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 321</ref>\n\nAllen and his family moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small frontier settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on ''An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being'', which he characterized as an appendix to ''Reason''. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe.<ref name=\"Jellison325_6\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 325\u2013326</ref> The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.<ref name=\"Jellison327\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 327</ref>\n\n===Death===\nOn February 11, 1789, Allen traveled to [[South Hero, Vermont]] with one of his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there and set out the next morning for home.<ref name=\"Hall198\">[[#Hall|Hall (1895)]], p. 198</ref> While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an [[apoplexy|apoplectic]] fit en route and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Bold Leaders of the American Revolution | author = Colonel Red Reeder | publisher = Little, Brown and Company, Boston | page = 22}}</ref><ref name=\"Jellison330\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 330</ref> He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington.<ref name=\"Jellison331\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 331</ref> The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.<ref name=\"Jellison331\"/>\n\nAllen's death made nationwide headlines. The ''Bennington Gazette'' wrote of the local hero, \"the patriotism and strong attachment which ever appeared uniform in the breast of this ''Great Man'', was worth of his exalted character; the public have to lament the loss of a man who has rendered them great service\".<ref name=\"Holbrook253\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 253</ref> Although most obituaries were positive, a number of clergymen expressed different sentiments. \"Allen was an ignorant and profane Deist, who died with a mind replete with horror and despair\" was the opinion of [[Newark, New Jersey]]'s Reverend Uzal Ogden.<ref name=\"Jellison331\"/> Yale's Timothy Dwight expressed satisfaction that the world no longer had to deal with a man of \"peremptoriness and effrontery, rudeness and ribaldry\".<ref name=\"Jellison331\"/> It is not recorded what New York Governor Clinton's reaction was to the news.<ref name=\"Jellison331\"/>\n\n==Family==\n\nAllen's widow Fanny gave birth to a son, Ethan Alphonso, on October 24, 1789. She eventually remarried. Allen's two youngest sons went on to graduate from [[West Point]] and serve in the [[United States Army]]. H.M. Allen was the 7th graduate, a member of the Class of 1804, and served until 1813.  E.A. Allen was the 22nd graduate, a member of the Class of 1806, and served until 1821. His daughter [[Fanny Allen|Fanny]] achieved notice when she converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and entered a convent.<ref name=\"Holbrook258\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 258</ref> His grandson, [[Ethan A.

Photographs of his grandson, General Ethan Allen Hitchcock, are extant, and, Hitchcock's mother said that he bore a strong resemblance to her father.<ref name=\"Holbrook264\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], p. 264</ref> The nearest potential images included one claimed to be by noted Revolutionary War era engraver [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere]] that turned out to be a forgery, and a reference to a portrait possibly by [[Ralph Earl (artist)|Ralph Earl]] that has not been found (as of Stewart Holbrook's writing in 1940).<ref name=\"Holbrook262_3\">[[#Holbrook|Holbrook]], pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Alexander Graydon, with whom Allen was paroled during his captivity in New York, described him like this:\n\n\"His figure was that of a robust, large-framed man, worn down by confinement and hard fare; but he was now recovering his flesh and spirits; and a suit of blue clothes, with a gold laced hat that had been presented to him by the gentlement of Cork, enabled him to make a very passable appearance for a rebel colonel ... I have seldom met with a man, possessing, in my opinion, a stronger mind, or whose mode of expression was more vehement and oratorical.  Notwithstanding that Allen might have had something of the insubordinate, lawless frontier spirit in his composition ... he appeared to me to be a man of generosity and honor.\"<ref name=\"Jellison171\">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 171</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\nAllen's final home, on the Onion River (now called the Winooski River), is a part of the [[Ethan Allen Homestead and Museum]].

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of the future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life; and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the maximum Incan God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claims that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nA small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito. Painting of 18th century. [[Quito School|Quito Painting Colonial School]].]]\nNew infectious diseases, endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the Amerindian population during the first decades of Spanish rule, as they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

The people were very happy about the independence and celebrated, which is now Ecuador's independence day, officially on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830 Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the struggle for independence, before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar in December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin and Tumbes and Jaen which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe river or the Huancabamba river. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:Gran Colombia map 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region which it began calling Loreto with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with the Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924 the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937 the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian Land Claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate= July 15, 2013 |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The final border demarcation came into effect on May 13, 1999 and the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment withdrew on June 17, 1999.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\"/>\n\n===Military governments (1972\u201379)===\nIn 1972, a \"revolutionary and nationalist\" military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra. The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005. Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] took his place and remained in office until the presidential [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election of 2006]], in which [[Rafael Correa]] gained the presidency.<ref name=\"Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent\">{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/01/ecuador-president-police-attack |title=Ecuador's president attacked by police  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= October 1, 2010|accessdate=September 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, president Correa declared Ecuador's [[national debt]] illegitimate, based on the argument that it was [[odious debt]] contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes.

The current president of Ecuador, [[Lenin Moreno]], exercises his power from the presidential [[Palacio de Carondelet]] in Quito. The [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|current constitution]] was written by the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] elected in 2007, and was approved by referendum in 2008.

Provincial governors and councilors (mayors, aldermen, and parish boards) are directly elected. The [[National Assembly of Ecuador]] meets throughout the year except for recesses in July and December. There are thirteen permanent committees. Members of the National Court of Justice are appointed by the National Judicial Council for nine-year terms.\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{Main|List of heads of state of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Quito PalaciodeGobierno.JPG|thumb|[[Palacio de Carondelet]], the executive branch of the Ecuadorian Government]]\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is led by the president, an office currently held by [[Lenin Moreno]]. He is accompanied by the vice-president, currently [[Jorge Glas]], elected for four years (with the ability to be re-elected only once). As head of state and chief government official, he is responsible for public administration including the appointing of national coordinators, ministers, ministers of State and public servants. The executive branch defines foreign policy, appoints the Chancellor of the Republic, as well as ambassadors and consuls, being the ultimate authority over the [[:Military of Ecuador|Armed Forces of Ecuador]], [[National Police of Ecuador]], and appointing authorities. The acting president's wife receives the title of [[First Lady of Ecuador]].\n\n===Legislative branch===\n{{Main|National Assembly (Ecuador)}}\n\nThe legislative branch is embodied by the [[National Assembly of Ecuador|National Assembly]], which is headquartered in the city of [[Quito]] in the Legislative Palace, and consists of 137 assemblymen, divided into ten committees and elected for a four-year term. Fifteen national constituency elected assembly, two Assembly members elected from each province and one for every 100,000 inhabitants or fraction exceeding 150,000, according to the latest national population census. In addition, statute determines the election of assembly of regions, and metropolitan districts.\n\n===Judicial branch===\nEcuador's judiciary has as its main body the Judicial Council, and also includes the National Court of Justice, provincial courts, and lower courts. Legal representation is made by the Judicial Council.\nThe National Court of Justice is composed of 21 judges elected for a term of nine years. Judges are renewed by thirds every three years pursuant to the Judicial Code. These are elected by the Judicial Council on the basis of opposition proceedings and merits.\nThe justice system is buttressed by the independent offices of public prosecutor and the public defender. Auxiliary organs are as follows: [[Civil law notary|notaries]], court auctioneers, and court receivers. Also there is a special legal regime for Amerindians.\n\n===Electoral branch===\nThe electoral system functions by authorities which enter only every four years or when [[Elections in Ecuador|elections or referendums]] occur. Its main functions are to organize, control elections, and punish the infringement of electoral rules. Its main body is the [[National Electoral Council (Ecuador)|National Electoral Council]], which is based in the city of Quito, and consists of seven members of the [[Political parties in Ecuador|political parties]] most voted, enjoying complete financial and administrative autonomy. This body, along with the [[Electoral Tribunal|electoral court]], forms the ''Electoral Branch'' which is one of Ecuador's five [[Separation of powers|branches of government]].\n\n===Transparency and social control branch===\nThe Transparency and Social Control consists of the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, an [[ombudsman]], the Comptroller General of the State, and the superintendents. Branch members hold office for five years. This branch is responsible for promoting transparency and control plans publicly, as well as plans to design mechanisms to combat corruption, as also designate certain authorities, and be the regulatory mechanism of accountability in the country.\n\n===Human rights===\n[[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN's Human Rights Council]]'s (HRC) Universal Periodic Review (UPR) has treated the restrictions on [[freedom of expression]] and efforts to control [[NGO]]s and recommended that Ecuador should stop the criminal sanctions for the expression of opinions, and delay in implementing judicial reforms.

Ecuador's membership in the OPEC in the 1970s and 1980s allowed Ecuadorian leaders to exercise somewhat greater foreign policy autonomy. In Antarctica, Ecuador has maintained a peaceful research station for scientific study as a member nation of the [[Antarctica Treaty]]. Ecuador has often placed great emphasis on multilateral approaches to international issues. Ecuador is a member of the United Nations (and most of its specialized agencies) and a member of many regional groups, including the [[Rio Group]], the [[Latin American Economic System]], the [[Latin American Energy Organization]], the [[Latin American Integration Association]], the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]], the [[Andean Community of Nations]], the Union of South American Nations ([[UNASUR]]), and The Bank of the South (Spanish: Banco del Sur or BancoSur).\n\nThe Ecuadorian government commits itself to upholding a [[progressivism|progressive]] attitude towards [[human migration|migration]] related problems, [[manifesto|declaring]] its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] ''\"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility\"'' (Spanish: ''Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana''). In 2017, the Ecuadorian parliament adopted a ''Law on human mobility'' <ref>[https://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ley_de_movilidad_humana_oficial.pdf Ley Org\u00e1nica de Movilidad Humana]</ref>.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jose Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin.

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n*'''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].\n*'''La Amazon\u00eda''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or \"the east\": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumb\u00edos Province|Sucumb\u00edos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n*'''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region. Its largest city is Guayaquil, in the [[Guayas Province]]. [[Cotopaxi]], just south of Quito, is one of the world's highest active volcanoes. The top of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mount Chimborazo]] (6,268 m, or 20,560&nbsp;ft, above sea level), Ecuador's tallest mountain, is the most distant point from the center of the Earth on the Earth's surface because of the [[ellipsoid]] shape of the planet.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html |title=Ecuador|work=The World Factbook |accessdate= August 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Ecuador map of [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].]]\n\nThere is great variety in the climate, largely determined by altitude. It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the La Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the La Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Ecuador - Serran\u00edas Cof\u00e1n-Bermejo, Sinangoe (2002) (21157752225).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ecuador is one of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world, it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation, and is one of the highest [[endemism]] worldwide.

Faced with the growth of the tourism sector, in June 1994, the decision was taken to separate tourism from information, so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity.\n\nEcuador is a country with vast natural wealth. The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna. It has around 1640 kinds of birds. The species of butterflies border the 4,500, the reptiles 345, the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258, among others. Not in vain, Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet's highest biodiversity is concentrated, being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world. Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State. Also, it has a huge culture spectrum. Since 2007, with the government of Rafael Correa, the tourism brand \"Ecuador Ama la Vida\" has been transformed, with which the nation's tourism promotion would be sold. Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature, natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples. And for this, means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy.\n\nThe country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Quito and Cuenca, as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]], such as the Cajas massif. Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.\n\nAmong the main tourist destinations are:\n\n*Nature attractions: [[Galapagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]].\n\n*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.\n\n*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.\n\n*Beaches: Crucita, [[Atacames]], [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Monta\u00f1ita]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Quito Trole 06 2011 1933.jpg|thumb|The [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Troleb\u00fas]] bus rapid transit system that runs through [[Quito]].

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

The White Ecuadorians ([[White Latin American]]) account for 6.1% of the population of Ecuador and can be found throughout all of Ecuador primarily around the urban areas. Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

However, as more and more North Americans are discovering Ecuador's potential, property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago, particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Ca\u00f1ari people 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Ca\u00f1ari]] children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes]]\nEcuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and, like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish, though many speak Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on.\n[[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It's originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{double image|right|Ceviche ecuador.JPG|150|Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg|154|''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Quito pic b4.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Quito]]\n[[File:Ama la Vida - Flickr - Periodistas espa\u00f1oles recorren Centro Hist\u00f3rico de Quito 2014 (14476342297).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Metropolitan Cultural Center|Centro Cultural Metropolitano]] in the historic center of Quito]]\n\n===Literature===\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972]</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.\n\n===Art===\nThe best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quite\u00f1a]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts.

One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

During this time a variety of cultures and territories influenced what has become the [[Ecuador|Republic of Ecuador]]. The history can be divided into five eras: Pre-Columbian, the Conquest, the Colonial Period, the [[Ecuadorian War of Independence|War of Independence]], [[Gran Colombia]], and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] the final separation of his vision into what is known today as the Republic of Ecuador.\n\n==Pre-Columbian Ecuador==\n{{main|Pre-Columbian Ecuador}}\n{{see also|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}\nDuring the pre-Inca period, people lived in ans, which formed great tribes, some allied with each other to form powerful confederations, as the Confederation of Quito. But none of these confederations could resist the formidable momentum of the [[Tawantinsuyu]]. The invasion of the Incas in the 16th century was very painful and bloody. However, once occupied by the Quito hosts of [[Huayna Capac]] (1593\u20131595), the Incas. developed an extensive administration and began the colonization of the region. The [[Pre-Columbian era]] can be divided up into four eras: the Pre-ceramic Period, the Formative Period, the Period of Regional Development and the Period of Integration and the Arrival of the Incas.\n\nThe Pre-ceramic period begins with the end of the first ice-age  and continued until 4200BC. The [[Las Vegas culture]] and The Inga Cultures dominated this period. The Las Vegas culture lived on the [[Santa Elena Peninsula]] on the coast of Ecuador between 9,000\u20136,000 BC. The earliest people were hunters-gatherers and fishermen. Around 6,000 BC cultures in the region were among the first to begin farming.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stothert |first=Karen E. |date=July 1985 |title=The Pre-ceramic Las Vegas Culture of Coastal Ecuador | journal=American Antiquity |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=613\u2013637 | doi=10.2307/280325 |jstor=280325 |publisher=Society for American Archaeology}}</ref> The Ingas lived in the Sierra near present-day Quito between 9000 and 8000 BC along an ancient trade route.<ref>Pre-Historic Civilizations in Ecuador in Ancient History is owned by Dennis Jamison.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| title = [[Valdivia culture]]\n| image1 = MORTERO JAGUAR VALDIVIA 2.JPG|width1=200|caption1=Mortar, Jaguar Valdivia, South Coast (4000 BCE to 1500 BCE).\n| image2 = Valdivia Female Figurine 2600-1500 BCE Brooklyn Museum.jpg|width2=100|caption2=Ceramic female figurine (2600-1500 BCE).\n}}\nDuring the Formative Period, people of the region moved from hunter-gathering and simple farming into a more developed society, with permanent developments, an increase in agriculture and the use of ceramics. New cultures included the [[Machalilla culture]], [[Valdivia]], Chorrera in the coast; Cotocollao, The Chimba in the sierra; and Pastaza, Chiguaza in the eastern region. The [[Valdivia culture]] is the first culture where significant remains have been discovered. Their civilization dates back as early as 3500 B.C. Living in the area near The Valdivias, they were the first Americans to use pottery. They navigated the seas and established a trade network with tribes in the Andes and the Amazon.<ref name=\"lcweb2\"/> Succeeding the Valdivia, the [[Machalilla culture]] were a farming culture who thrived along the coast of Ecuador between the 2nd and 1st millennia BC. These appear to be the earliest people to cultivate maize in this part of South America.<ref>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology. Copyright \u00a9 2002, 2003 by Oxford University Press.</ref> Existing in the late formative period the Chorrera culture lived in the Andes and Coastal Regions of Ecuador between 1000 and 300 BC.\n\n===Period of Regional Development===\nThe period of Regional Development is identified for the first time the regional differences in the territorial or political and social organization of people that formed. Among the main towns of this period were the cultures: Jambel\u00ed, Guangala, Bahia, Tejar-Daule, La Tolita, Jama Coaque in the coast of Ecuador, in the sierras the Cerro Narr\u00edo Alaus\u00ed; and in the Ecuadorian Amazon jungle the Tayos.\n\n====La Bahia====\nThe figurine of 300 BC \u2013 500 AD) La Chimba is the site of the earliest ceramic northern Andes, north of Quito, and is representative of the Formative Period in its final stage. Its inhabitants contacted several villages on the coast and the mountains, keeping close proximity to the [[Cotocollao Indians|Cotocollao culture]], located on the plateau of Quito and its surrounding valleys. The Bahia culture occupied the area that stretches from the foothills of the Andes to the Pacific Ocean, and from [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], to the south of Manabi. The Jama-Coaque culture inhabited areas between Cabo San Francisco in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], to Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez, in Manabi, in an area of wooded hills and vast beaches of their immigrant who facilitated the gathering of resources of both the jungle and the ocean.\n\n====La Tolita culture====\n[[File:Tolita mythological figure in feathered costume IMJ B77.0161.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|[[History_of_Ecuador#La_Tolita_culture|Tumaco-La Tolita]] mythological figure in feathered costume.

They created better housing that allowed them to improve their living conditions and no longer be subject to the climate. In the mountains Cosangua-P\u00edllaro, the [[Capul\u00ed culture|Capul\u00ed]] and Piartal-Tuza cultures arose, in the eastern region was the Yasun\u00ed Phase while the Milagro, Mante\u00f1a and Huancavilca cultures developed on the coast.\n\n====The Mante\u00f1os====\nThe [[Mante\u00f1o]]s were the last of the pre-Columbian cultures in the coastal region existing between 600\u20131534. They were the first to witness the arrival of Spanish ships sailing in the surrounding Pacific Ocean. According to archaeological evidence and Spanish chronicles the civilization existed from [[Bahia de Caraquez]] to Cerro de Hojas in the south. \nThey were excellent weavers, produced textiles, articles of gold, silver spondylus shells and mother of pearls. The mante\u00f1os mastered the seas and created an extensive trade routes as far as Chile to the south and Western Mexico to the north.<ref>James A. Zeidler of Colorado State University</ref> The center of the culture was in the area of [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]] which was named in their honor.\n\n====The Huancavilcas==== \nThe Huancavilcas constitute the most important pre-Columbian culture of Guayas. These warriors were noted for their appearance. Huancavilca of culture is the legend of Guayas and Quiles, which gives its name to the city of Guayaquil.\n\n====The Shyris and the Kingdom of Quito====\nThe existence of the Kingdom of Quito{{Citation needed|reason=No trustworthy evidence of a pre-Incan kingdom in that area|date=September 2018}} was formed by the Quitus, the Puruhaes and Ca\u00f1ari who inhabited the Andean regions of Ecuador by that time. Their main settlement was located in the area now known as the city of Quito, and its inhabitants were called Quitus. The Quitus were militarily weak, and formed only a small, poorly organized kingdom. Because of this it could not raise a strong resistance against invaders, and were easily defeated and subjugated by the Shyris, ancient indigenous people who joined the Kingdom of Quito. The Shyris dominated for more than 700 years, and their dynasty saw the invasion of the Inca Tupac Yupanqui.\n\n====The Incas====\nThe [[Inca civilization]] expansion northward from modern-day [[Peru]] during the late 15th century met with fierce resistance by several Ecuadorian tribes, particularly the Ca\u00f1ari, in the region around modern-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]; the Cara in the Sierra north of Quito along with the [[Quitu]], occupants of the site of the modern capital, with whom they had formed the Kingdom of Quito. The conquest of Ecuador began in 1463 under the leadership of the ninth Inca, the great warrior [[Pachacuti]] Inca Yupanqui. In that year, his son Tupa took over command of the army and began his march northward through the Sierra.\n\nBy 1500 Tupa's son, [[Huayna Capac]], overcame the resistance of these populations and that of the Cara, and thus incorporated most of modern-day Ecuador into [[Inca Empire|Tawantinsuyu]], or the Inca empire.<ref>{{cite book| last = Rudolph  | first = James D. | title = A Country Study: Ecuador | publisher = Library of Congress | year = 1991 | location = Washington, D.C. | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html | lccn=91009494  | isbn = 0844407305}}</ref> The influence of these conquerors based in [[Cuzco]] (modern-day Peru) was limited to about a half century, or less in some parts of Ecuador. During that period, some aspects of life remained unchanged. Traditional religious beliefs, for example, persisted throughout the period of Inca rule. In other areas, however, such as agriculture, land tenure, and social organization, Inca rule had a profound effect despite its relatively short duration.<ref>Starn, Degregori, Kirk ''The Peru Reader: History, Culture, Politics''; Quote by Pedro de Cieza de Leon; Published by Duke University Press, 1995</ref>\n\nEmperor Huayna Capac became fond of Quito, making it a secondary capital of [[Inca Empire|Tawantinsuyu]] and living out his elder years there before his death in about 1527. Huayna Capac's sudden death and the death days later of the Incan heir apparent from a strange disease, described by one source as [[smallpox]],<ref>Lovell, W. George. \"\"Heavy Shadows and Black Night\": Disease and Depopulation in Colonial Spanish America.\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 82, no. 3, The Americas before and after 1492: Current Geographical Research (Sep., 1992): 426\u2013443.</ref> precipitated a bitter power struggle between the legitimate heir [[Hu\u00e1scar]], whose mother was Coya (Empress) Mama Rahua Occillo, and [[Atahualpa]], a son born to a Quitu princess who was reputedly his father's favorite.\n\nThis struggle raged during the half-decade before the arrival of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s conquering expedition in 1532. The key battle of this [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] was fought on Ecuadorian soil, near [[Riobamba]], where Hu\u00e1scar's northbound troops were met and defeated by Atahualpa's southbound troops. Atahualpa's final victory over Hu\u00e1scar in the days just before the Spanish conquerors arrived resulted in large part from the loyalty of two of Huayna Capac's best generals, who were based in Quito along with Atahualpa. The victory remains a source of national pride to Ecuadorians as a rare case when \"Ecuador\" bested a \"neighboring country\" by force.\n\n==Spanish discovery and conquest==\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire}}\n\nAs the [[Inca Civil War]] raged, in 1531 the Spanish landed in Ecuador. Led by [[Francisco Pizarro]], the conquistadors learned that the conflict and disease were destroying the empire.<ref>Macquarrie, K. ''The Last Days of the Incas''. P Dippolito. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007.</ref> After receiving reinforcements in September 1532, Pizzaro set out to the newly victorious Atahualpa.\n\nArriving at [[Cajamarca]], Pizarro sent an embassy, led by [[Hernando de Soto]], with 15 horsemen and an interpreter; shortly thereafter he sent 20 more horsemen led by his brother [[Hernando Pizarro]] as reinforcements in case of an Inca attack.<ref>Hemming, The conquest, pp. 34\u201335.</ref> [[Atahualpa]] was in awe of these men{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} dressed in full clothing, with long beards and riding horses (an animal he had never seen). In town Pizzaro set a trap for the Inca and the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] began. The Inca forces greatly out numbered the Spanish; however, the Spanish superiority of weapons and tactics and the fact that the most trusted Inca generals were in Cusco led to an easy defeat and the capture of the Incan Emperor.\n\nDuring the next year Pizzaro held Atahualpa for ransom. The Incas filled the Ransom Room with gold and silver awaiting a release that would never happen. On August 29, 1533 Atahualpa was garroted. The Spanish then set out to conquer the rest of [[Tawantinsuyu]], capturing Cuzco in November 1533.\n\nBenalc\u00e1zar, Pizarro's lieutenant and fellow Extremaduran, had already departed from San Miguel with 140 foot soldiers and a few horses on his conquering mission to Ecuador. At the foot of Mount Chimborazo, near the modern city of Riobamba (Ecuador), he met and defeated the forces of the great Inca warrior [[Rumi\u00f1ahui (Inca warrior)|Rumi\u00f1ahui]] with the aid of Ca\u00f1ari tribesmen who served as guides and allies to the conquering Spaniards. Rumi\u00f1ahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalc\u00e1zar encountered another, quite sizable, conquering party led by Guatemalan Governor [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Bored with administering Central America, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra. Most of Alvarado's men joined Benalc\u00e1zar for the siege of Quito. In 1533, Rumi\u00f1ahui burned the city to prevent the Spanish from taking it, destroying the ancient pre-Hispanic city.\n\nIn 1534 [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] along with [[Diego de Almagro]] established the city of San Francisco de Quito on top of the ruins of the secondary Inca capital, naming it in honor of Pizzaro. It was not until December 1540 that Quito received its first captain-general in the person of Francisco Pizarro's brother, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]].\n\nBenalc\u00e1zar had also founded the city of Guayaquil in 1533, but it had subsequently been retaken by the local Huancavilca tribesmen. [[Francisco de Orellana]], yet another lieutenant of Francisco Pizarro from the Spanish city of Trujillo, put down the native rebellion and in 1537 reestablished this city, which a century later would become one of Spain's principal ports in South America.\n\n==Spanish colonial era==\n{{see also|Royal Audience of Quito}}\n[[Image:Real Audiencia de Quito.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Map of [[Royal Audience of Quito]]. Most of its Amazonian territory was never under its effective control.]]\nBetween 1544 and 1563, Ecuador was an integral [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain's colonies in the New World]] under the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], having no administrative status independent of Lima. It remained a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1720, when it joined the newly created [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]; within the viceroyalty, however, Ecuador was awarded its own audiencia in 1563, allowing it to deal directly with Madrid on certain matters. The [[Royal Audience of Quito|Quito Audiencia]], which was both a court of justice and an advisory body to the viceroy, consisted of a president and several judges (oidores).\n\nThe most common form in which the Spanish occupied the land was the [[encomienda]]. By the early 17th century, there were some 500 encomiendas in Ecuador. Although many consisted of quite sizable haciendas, they were generally much smaller than the estates commonly found elsewhere in South America. A multitude of reforms and regulations did not prevent the encomienda from becoming a system of virtual slavery of the Native Ecuadorians, estimated at about one-half the total Ecuadorian population, who lived on them. In 1589 the president of the audiencia recognized that many Spaniards were accepting grants only to sell them and undertake urban occupations, and he stopped distributing new lands to Spaniards; however, the institution of the encomienda persisted until nearly the end of the colonial period.\n\nThe coastal lowlands north of Manta were conquered, not by the Spanish, but by blacks from the Guinean coast who, as slaves, were shipwrecked en route from Panama to Peru in 1570. The blacks killed or enslaved the native males and married the females, and within a generation they constituted a population of [[zambo]]s that resisted Spanish authority until the end of the century and afterwards managed to retain a great deal of political and cultural independence.\n\nThe coastal economy revolved around shipping and trade. Guayaquil, despite being destroyed on several occasions by fire and incessantly plagued by either yellow fever or malaria, was a center of vigorous trade among the colonies, a trade that was technically illegal under the mercantilist philosophy of the contemporary Spanish rulers. Guayaquil also became the largest shipbuilding center on the west coast of South America before the end of the colonial period.\n\nThe Ecuadorian economy, like that in the mother country, suffered a severe depression throughout most of the 18th century. Textile production dropped an estimated 50 to 75 percent between 1700 and 1800. Ecuador's cities gradually fell into ruins, and by 1790 the elite was reduced to poverty, selling haciendas and jewelry in order to subsist. The Native Ecuadorian population, in contrast, probably experienced an overall improvement in its situation, as the closing of the obrajes commonly led Native Ecuadorians to work under less arduous conditions on either haciendas or traditional communal lands. Ecuador's economic woes were, no doubt, compounded by the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] in 1767 by [[King Charles III of Spain]]. Missions in the Oriente were abandoned, and many of the best schools and the most efficient haciendas and obrajes lost the key that made them outstanding institutions in colonial Ecuador.\n\n==Jesuits of Quito during the Colonial era==\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

[[Quito School|Quito Painting Colonial School]].]]\nFather [[Rafael Ferrer (Jesuit)|Rafael Ferrer]] was the first Jesuita de Quito (Jesuit of Quito) to explore and found missions in the upper Amazon regions of [[South America]] from 1602 to 1610, which at that period belonged to the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Audiencia of Quito]], that was a part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until the Audiencia of Quito was transferred to the newly created [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in 1717. In 1602, Father Rafael Ferrer  began to explore the Aguarico, Napo, and  Mara\u00f1on rivers ( Sucumbios region  in what is today Ecuador and Peru),  and set up, between 1604 and 1605, missions among the [[Cofane]] natives.  Father Rafael Ferrer was martyred when an apostate native killed him in 1610.\n\nIn 1637, the Jesuits of Quito, [[Gaspar Cugia]] and [[Lucas de la Cueva]] began establishing some Jesuit missions in Mainas or Maynas. These missions were called the  Mainas Missions after the Mainas natives that were found on the banks of the Mara\u00f1on river,  around the [[Pongo de Manseriche]] region, in close proximity to the close to the Spanish settlement of [[Borja, Peru|Borja]].\n\nIn 1639, the Audiencia of Quito organized an expedition to renew its exploration of the Amazon river and the Quito Jesuit (Jesuita Quite\u00f1o)  Father [[Cristobal de Acu\u00f1a]] was a part of this expedition. The expedition disembarked from the Napo river  February 16, 1639, and arrived in what is today Par\u00e1 Brazil, on the banks of the Amazon river on December 12, 1639. In 1641, Father Cristobal de Acu\u00f1a published in Madrid a memoire of his expedition to the Amazon river. The title of the memoire is called Nuevo Descubrimiento del gran rio de las Amazonas, and it was used by academics as a fundamental reference pertaining to the Amazon region.\n\nBetween 1637 and 1652, there were 14 missions established along the [[Mara\u00f1on river]] and its southern tributaries \u2013 the Huallaga and the Ucayali rivers.  Jesuit Fathers de la Cueva and [[Raimundo de Santacruz]] opened up 2 new routes of communication with Quito, through the Pastaza and Napo rivers.\n\nBetween 1637 and 1715, [[Samuel Fritz]] founded 38 missions along the length of the Amazon river, between the Napo and Negro rivers,  that were called the Omagua Missions. These missions were continually attacked by the Brazilian [[Bandeirantes]] beginning in the year 1705.  In 1768, the only Omagua mission that was left was San Joaquin de Omaguas,  since it had been moved to a new location on the Napo river away from the Bandeirantes.\n\nIn the immense territory of Mainas, also referred to as Maynas, the Jesuitas of Quito, made contact with a number of indigenous tribes which spoke 40 different languages, and founded a total of 173 Jesuit missions with a total population of 150, 000 inhabitants. Because of the constant plague of epidemics (smallpox and measles) and warfare with other tribes and the Bandeirantes,  the total number of Jesuit Missions  were reduced to 40 by 1744.  At  the time when the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish America in 1767,  the Jesuits of Quito registered 36 missions run by 25  Jesuits of Quito in the Audiencia of Quito \u2013 6  Jesuits of Quito in the Napo Missions and Aguarico Missions, and 19 Jesuits of Quito in  the Pastaza Missions and Iquitos Missions of Maynas with a total population of 20,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Struggle for independence and birth of the republic==\n{{main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n\nThe struggle for independence in the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Quito Audiencia]] was part of a movement throughout Spanish America led by [[Criollo people|Criollos]]. The Criollos' resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the [[Peninsulares]] was the fuel of revolution against colonial rule. The spark was [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain, after which he deposed [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] and, in July 1808, placed his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the Spanish throne.<ref name=\"lcweb2\">Rudolph, James D. \"Historical Setting\". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html ''A Country Study: Ecuador''] (Dennis M. Hanratty, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1989). ''This article incorporates text from this source which is in the public domain.''</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Spanish citizens, unhappy at the usurpation of the throne by the French, began organizing local [[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] loyal to Ferdinand. A group of Quito's leading citizens followed suit, and on August 10, 1809, they seized power in the name of Ferdinand from the local representatives, whom they accused of preparing to recognize Joseph Bonaparte. Thus, this early revolt against colonial rule (one of the first in Spanish America) was, paradoxically, an expression of loyalty to the Spanish king.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that Quito's Criollo rebels lacked the anticipated popular support for their cause. As loyalist troops approached Quito, they peacefully turned power back to the crown authorities. Despite assurances against reprisals, the returning Spanish authorities proved to be merciless with the rebels and, in the process of ferreting out participants in the Quito revolt, jailed and abused many innocent citizens. Their actions, in turn, bred popular resentment among Quite\u00f1os, who, after several days of street fighting in August 1810, won an agreement to be governed by a junta composed with a majority of Criollos, although with the Peninsular president of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] acting as its head.\n\nIn spite of strong opposition from the Quito Audiencia, the Junta called for a congress in December 1811 and declared the entire area of the audiencia to be independent of any government currently in Spain. Two months later, the Junta approved a constitution for the state of Quito that provided for democratic governing institutions but also granted recognition to the authority of Ferdinand should he return to the Spanish throne. Shortly thereafter, the Junta elected to launch a military offensive against loyalist regions to the south in Peru, but the poorly trained and badly equipped troops were no match for those of the Viceroy of Peru, which finally crushed the Quite\u00f1o rebellion in December 1812.\n\n===Gran Colombia===\n{{main|Gran Colombia}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|250px|General Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, Commander In Chief, ''Divisi\u00f3n del Sur''.]]\nThe second chapter in Ecuador's struggle for emancipation from Spanish colonial rule began in Guayaquil, where independence was proclaimed in October 1820 by a local patriotic junta under the leadership of the poet [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]. By this time, the forces of independence had grown continental in scope and were organized into two principal armies, one under the Venezuelan [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in the north and the other under the Argentine [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in the south. Unlike the hapless Quito junta of a decade earlier, the Guayaquil patriots were able to appeal to foreign allies, Argentina and Gran Colombia, each of whom soon responded by sending sizable contingents to Ecuador. [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], the brilliant young lieutenant of Bol\u00edvar who arrived in Guayaquil in May 1821, was to become the key figure in the ensuing military struggle against the royalist forces.\n\nAfter a number of initial successes, Sucre's army was defeated at Ambato in the central Sierra and he appealed for assistance from San Mart\u00edn, whose army was by now in Peru. With the arrival from the south of 1,400 fresh soldiers under the command of [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz|Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz Calahumana]], the fortunes of the patriotic army were again reversed. A string of victories culminated in the decisive [[Battle of Pichincha]].\n\nTwo months later Bol\u00edvar, the liberator of northern South America, entered Quito to a hero's welcome. Later that July, he met San Mart\u00edn at the [[Guayaquil conference]] and convinced the Argentine general, who wanted the port to return to Peruvian jurisdiction, and the local Criollo elite in both major cities of the advantage of having the former Quito Audiencia join with the liberated lands to the north. As a result, Ecuador became the District of the South within the Republic of Gran Colombia, which also included present-day [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] and had Bogot\u00e1 as its capital. This status was maintained for eight tumultuous years.\n\n[[File:Gran Colombia map 1824.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\nThese were years in which warfare dominated the affairs of Ecuador. First, the country found itself on the front lines of Gran Colombia's efforts to liberate Peru from Spanish rule between 1822 and 1825; afterward, in 1828 and 1829, Ecuador was in the middle of an armed [[Gran Colombia\u2013Peru War|struggle between Peru and Gran Colombia]] over the location of their common border. After a campaign that included the near destruction of Guayaquil, the forces of Gran Colombia, under the leadership of Sucre and Venezuelan General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], proved victorious. The Treaty of 1829 fixed the border on the line that had divided the Quito audiencia and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] before independence.\n\nThe population of Ecuador was divided during these years among three segments: those favoring the status quo, those supporting union with Peru, and those advocating independence for the former audiencia. The latter group was to prevail following Venezuela's withdrawal from Gran Colombia at the very moment that an 1830 constitutional congress had been called in an ultimately futile effort to stem the growing separatist tendencies throughout country. In May of that year, a group of Quito notables met to dissolve the union with Gran Colombia, and in August, a constituent assembly drew up a constitution for the State of Ecuador, so named for its geographic proximity to the equator, and placed General Flores in charge of political and military affairs. He remained the dominant political figure during Ecuador's first 15 years of independence.\n\n==The Republic of Ecuador==\n\n===The early republic===\n{{further|History of Ecuador (1830\u20131860)}}\n[[Image:Ecuador1830.png|thumb|left|250px|Ecuador in 1830]]\n\nBefore the year 1830 drew to a close, both [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre|Marshal Sucre]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] would be dead, the former murdered (on orders from a jealous General Flores, according to some historians) and the latter from [[tuberculosis]].\n\n[[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], known as the founder of the republic, was of the foreign military variety. Born in Venezuela, he had fought in the wars for independence with Bol\u00edvar, who had appointed him governor of Ecuador during its association with Gran Colombia. As a leader, however, he appeared primarily interested in maintaining his power. Military expenditures, from the independence wars and from an unsuccessful campaign to wrest [[Valle del Cauca Department|Cauca Province]] from Colombia in 1832, kept the state treasury empty while other matters were left unattended.\n\nDiscontent had become nationwide by 1845, when an insurrection in Guayaquil forced Flores from the country. Because their movement triumphed in March (''marzo''), the anti-Flores coalition members became known as ''[[Marcist Revolution|marcistas]]''. They were an extremely heterogeneous lot that included liberal intellectuals, conservative clergymen, and representatives from Guayaquil's successful business community.\n\nThe next fifteen years constituted one of the most turbulent periods in Ecuador's century and a half as a nation. The marcistas fought among themselves almost ceaselessly and also had to struggle against Flores's repeated attempts from exile to overthrow the government. The most significant figure of the era, however, was General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]], who first came to power in 1851 through a coup d'\u00e9tat, remained in the presidency until 1856, and then continued to dominate the political scene until 1860. During this decade and the one that followed, Urbina and his archrival, Garc\u00eda Moreno, would define the dichotomy \u2014 between Liberals from Guayaquil and Conservatives from Quito \u2014 that remained the major sphere of political struggle in Ecuador until the 1980s.\n\nBy 1859 \u2014 known by Ecuadorian historians as \"the Terrible Year\" \u2014 the nation was on the brink of anarchy. Local caudillos had declared several regions autonomous of the central government, known as ''Jefaturas Supremas''. One of these caudillos, Guayaquil's Guillermo Franco, signed the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian war of 1858|Treaty of Mapasingue]], ceding the southern provinces of Ecuador to an occupying Peruvian army led by General [[Ram\u00f3n Castilla]]. This action was outrageous enough to unite some previously disparate elements. Garc\u00eda Moreno, putting aside both his project to place Ecuador under a French protectorate and his differences with General Flores, got together with the former dictator to put down the various local rebellions and force out the Peruvians. The final push of this effort was the defeat of Franco's Peruvian-backed forces at the [[Battle of Guayaquil]], which led to the overturning of the Treaty of Mapasingue. This opened the last chapter of Flores's long career and marked the entrance to the power of Garc\u00eda Moreno.\n\n====The era of conservatism (1860\u20131895)====\n{{further|History of Ecuador (1860\u20131895)}}\n[[Image:Ecuador1860.png|thumb|left|250px|Ecuador in 1860]]\n[[Image:Gabrielgarciamoreno.jpg|thumb|250px|Gabriel Garcia Moreno, considered the ''Father of Ecuadorian conservatism''.]]\n\n[[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno]] was a leading figure of Ecuadorian conservatism. Shortly after the onset of his third presidential term in 1875, Garc\u00eda Moreno was attacked with a machete on the steps of the presidential palace by Faustino Lemos Rayo, a Colombian. As he was dying, Garc\u00eda Moreno took out his gun and shot Faustino Lemos, while he said \"''Dios no muere''\" (\"God doesn't die\"). The dictator's most outstanding critic was the liberal journalist, [[Juan Montalvo]], who exclaimed, \"My pen killed him!\"\n\nBetween 1852 and 1890, Ecuador's exports grew in value from slightly more than US$1 million to nearly US$10 million. Production of cacao, the most important export product in the late 19th century, grew from 6.5 million kilograms (14 million pounds) to 18 million kilograms (40 million pounds) during the same period. The agricultural export interests, centered in the coastal region near Guayaquil, became closely associated with the Liberals, whose political power also grew steadily during the interval. After the death of Garc\u00eda Moreno, it took the Liberals twenty years to consolidate their strength sufficiently to assume control of the government in Quito.\n\n[[Image:Ecuador1893.png|thumb|left|250px|Ecuador in 1893]]\n\n====The liberal era (1895\u20131925)====\n{{further|History of Ecuador (1895\u20131925)}}\n[[Image:Eloy Alfaro.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Eloy Alfaro]]\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|250px|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]].]]\nThe new era brought in liberalism. [[Eloy Alfaro]], under whose direction the government headed out to aid those in the rural sectors of the coast, is credited for finishing the construction of the railroad connecting Guayaquil and Quito, the separation of church and state, establishment of many public schools, implementing civil rights (such as freedom of speech), and the legalization of civil marriages and divorce.\n\nAlfaro was also confronted by a dissident tendency inside his own party, directed by its General [[Leonidas Plaza]] and constituted by the upper middle class of Guayaquil. His death was followed by economic liberalism (1912\u201325), when banks were allowed to acquire almost complete control of the country.\n\nPopular unrest, together with the ongoing economic crisis and a sickly president, laid the background for a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat in July 1925. Unlike all previous forays by the military into Ecuadorian politics, the coup of 1925 was made in the name of a collective grouping rather than a particular caudillo. The members of the League of Young Officers came to power with an agenda, which included a wide variety of social reforms, deal with the failing economy, establish the Central Bank as the unique authorized bank to distribute currency, create a new system of budget and customs.\n\n[[Image:Ecuador1920.png|thumb|left|250px|Ecuador in 1920]]\n\n====Early 20th century====\n{{further|History of Ecuador (1925\u20131944)}}\nMuch of the 20th century was dominated by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]], whose five presidential terms began with a mandate in 1934 and final presidency ending in 1972. However, the only term he actually completed was his third from 1952 to 1956.\n\nMuch of the century was also dominated by the [[History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute|territorial dispute between Peru and Ecuador]]. In 1941 [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|Ecuador invaded]] Peruvian territory, and the Peruvians counterattacked and forced them to retreat into their own territory. At that time Ecuador was immersed in internal political fights and was not well equipped to win its offensive war.\n\nWith the [[World War II|world at war]], Ecuador attempted to settle the matter by means of a third-party settlement. In Brazil the two countries' negotiations were overseen by four \"Guarantor\" states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States \u2014 four of the most powerful countries in the region).<ref>United States Institute of Peace  Washington, D.C.,</ref> The resulting treaty is known as the [[Rio Protocol]]. The protocol became the focus of a surge of Ecuadorian national pride and concomitant opposition, which resulted in an uprising and overthrow of the government.\n\n====The postwar era (1944\u20131948)====\nThe Quite\u00f1o multitudes stood in the pouring rain on May 31, 1944, to hear Velasco promise a \"national resurrection\", with social justice and due punishment for the \"corrupt Liberal oligarchy\" that had been responsible for \"staining the national honor\", believed that they were witnessing the birth of a popular revolution. Arroyo partisans were promptly jailed or sent into exile, while Velasco verbally baited the business community and the rest of the political right. The leftist elements within Velasco's Democratic Alliance, which dominated the constituent assembly that was convened to write a new constitution, were nonetheless destined to be disappointed.<ref name=\"lcweb2\" />\n\nIn May 1945, after a year of growing hostility between the president and the assembly, which was vainly awaiting deeds to substantiate Velasco's rhetorical advocacy of social justice, the mercurial chief executive condemned and then repudiated the newly completed constitution. After dismissing the assembly, Velasco held elections for a new assembly, which in 1946 drafted a far more conservative constitution that met with the president's approval. For this brief period, Conservatives replaced the left as Velasco's base of support.\n\nRather than attending to the nation's economic problems, however, Velasco aggravated them by financing the dubious schemes of his associates. Inflation continued unabated, as did its negative impact on the national standard of living, and by 1947 foreign exchange reserves had fallen to dangerously low levels. In August, when Velasco was ousted by his minister of defense, nobody rose to defend the man who, only three years earlier, had been hailed as the nation's savior. During the following year, three different men briefly held executive power before [[Galo Plaza|Galo Plaza Lasso]], running under a coalition of independent Liberals and socialists, narrowly defeated his Conservative opponent in presidential elections. His inauguration in September 1948 initiated what was to become the longest period of constitutional rule since the 1912\u201324 heyday of the Liberal plutocracy.\n\n====Constitutional rule (1947\u20131960)====\n{{further|History of Ecuador (1944\u20131960)}}\nGalo Plaza differed from previous Ecuadorian presidents by bringing a developmentalist and technocratic emphasis to Ecuadorian government. No doubt Galo Plaza's most important contribution to Ecuadorian political culture was his commitment to the principles and practices of democracy. As president he promoted the agricultural exports of Ecuador, creating economic stability. During his presidency, an earthquake near Ambato severely damaged the city and surrounding areas and killed approximately 8,000 people. Unable to succeed himself, he left his office in 1952 as the first president in 28 years to complete his term in office.\n\nA proof of the politically stabilizing effect of the banana boom of the 1950s is that even Velasco, who in 1952 was elected president for the third time, managed to serve out a full four-year term. Velasco's fourth term in the presidency initiated a renewal of crisis, instability, and military domination and ended conjecture that the political system had matured or developed in a democratic mold.\n\n====Instability and military governments (1960\u20131979)====\n{{further|Military Governments of Ecuador (1960\u20131979)}}\n\n====Return to democratic rule (1979\u20131984)====\n[[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]], democratically [[Ecuadorian general election, 1978\u20131979|elected in 1979]], presided over a nation that had undergone profound changes during the seventeen years of military rule. There were impressive indicators of economic growth between 1972 and 1979: The government budget expanded some 540 percent, whereas exports as well as per capita income increased a full 500 percent. Industrial development had also progressed, stimulated by the new oil wealth as well as Ecuador's preferential treatment under the provisions of the [[Andean Community of Nations|Andean Common Market (AnCoM, also known as the Andean Pact)]].\n\nRold\u00f3s was killed, along with his wife and the minister of defense, in an airplane crash in the southern province of Loja on May 24, 1981. The death of Rold\u00f3s generated intense popular speculation. Some Ecuadorian nationalists attributed it to the Peruvian government because the crash took place near the border where the two nations had participated in a [[Paquisha War]] in their perpetual border dispute. Many of the nation's leftists, pointing to a similar crash that had killed Panamanian President [[Omar Torrijos]] Herrera less than three months later, blamed the United States government.\n\nRold\u00f3s's constitutional successor, [[Osvaldo Hurtado]], immediately faced an economic crisis brought on by the sudden end of the petroleum boom. Massive foreign borrowing, initiated during the years of the second military regime and continued under Rold\u00f3s, resulted in a foreign debt that by 1983 was nearly US$7 billion. The nation's petroleum reserves declined sharply during the early 1980s because of exploration failures and rapidly increasing domestic consumption. The economic crisis was aggravated in 1982 and 1983 by drastic climatic changes, bringing severe drought as well as flooding, precipitated by the appearance of the unusually warm ocean current known as \"El Ni\u00f1o\". Analysts estimated damage to the nation's infrastructure at US$640 million, with balance-of-payments losses of some US$300 million. The real gross domestic product fell to 2% in 1982 and to \u22123.3% in 1983. The rate of inflation in 1983, 52.5%, was the highest ever recorded in the nation's history.\n\nOutside observers noted that, however unpopular, Hurtado deserved credit for keeping Ecuador in good standing with the international financial community and for consolidating Ecuador's democratic political system under extremely difficult conditions. As [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] entered office on August 10, there was no end in sight to the economic crisis nor to the intense struggle that characterized the political process in Ecuador.\n\nDuring the first years of the Rivadeneira administration, Febres-Cordero introduced free-market economic policies, took a strong stand against [[drug trafficking]] and [[terrorism]], and pursued close relations with the United States. His tenure was marred by bitter wrangling with other branches of Government and his own brief kidnapping by elements of the military. A [[1987 Ecuador earthquakes|devastating earthquake in March 1987]] interrupted oil exports and worsened the country's economic problems.\n\n[[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] of the [[Ecuadorian Roldosist Party|PRE]]. His government was committed to improving [[human rights]] protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1990.\n\n=====Economic crisis (1990\u20132000)=====\n{{See also|1998-99 Ecuador banking crisis}}\n\nIn 1992, [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]] won his third run for the presidency. His tough [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] adjustment measures were unpopular, but he succeeded in pushing a limited number of modernization initiatives through Congress. Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n's vice president, [[Alberto Dahik]], was the architect of the administration's economic policies, but in 1995, Dahik fled the country to avoid prosecution on [[political corruption|corruption]] charges following a heated political battle with the opposition. A war with Peru (named [[Cenepa War|the Cenepa War]], after a river located in the area) erupted in January\u2013February 1995 in a small, remote region, where the boundary prescribed by the 1942 [[Rio Protocol]] was in dispute. The Dur\u00e1n-Ball\u00e9n Administration can be credited with beginning the negotiations that would end in a final settlement of the territorial dispute.\n\nIn 1996, [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]], from the populist Ecuadorian Roldosista Party, won the presidency on a platform that promised populist economic and social reforms. Almost from the start, Bucaram's administration languished amidst widespread allegations of corruption. Empowered by the president's unpopularity with organized labor, business, and professional organizations alike, Congress unseated Bucaram in February 1997 on grounds of mental incompetence. The Congress replaced Bucaram with Interim President [[Fabi\u00e1n Alarc\u00f3n]].\n\nIn May 1997, following the demonstrations that led to the ousting of Bucaram and appointment of Alarc\u00f3n, the people of Ecuador called for a National Assembly to reform the Constitution and the country's political structure. After a little more than a year, the National Assembly produced a new Constitution.\n\nCongressional and first-round presidential elections were held on May 31, 1998. No presidential candidate obtained a majority, so a run-off election between the top two candidates \u2013 Quito Mayor [[Jamil Mahuad]] of the DP and Social Christian \u00c1lvaro Noboa Pont\u00f3n \u2013 was held on July 12, 1998. Mahuad won by a narrow margin. He took office on August 10, 1998. On the same day, Ecuador's new constitution came into effect.\n\nMahuad concluded a well-received peace with [[Peru]] on October 26, 1998, but increasing economic, fiscal, and financial difficulties drove his popularity steadily lower. However, the coup de gr\u00e2ce for Mahuad's administration was Mahuad's decision to make the local currency, the [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]] (named after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]), obsolete and replace it with the [[U.S. dollar]] (a policy called [[dollarization]]). This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless sucres to US dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in US dollars) gained wealth in turn. Under Mahuad's recession-plagued term, the economy shrank significantly, and inflation reached levels of up to 60 percent.\n\n====Ecuador since 2000====\n{{Update|section|date=June 2013}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}\nOn January 21, 2000, during demonstrations in Quito by indigenous groups, the military and police refused to enforce public order, beginning what became known as the [[2000 Ecuadorean coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Demonstrators entered the National Assembly building and declared, in a move that resembled the [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] endemic to Ecuadorean history, a three-person [[Military dictatorship|junta]] in charge of the country. Field-grade military officers declared their support for the concept. During a night of confusion and failed negotiations, President Mahuad was forced to flee the presidential palace for his own safety. Vice President [[Gustavo Noboa]] took charge by vice-presidential decree; Mahuad went on national television in the morning to endorse Noboa as his successor. The military triumvirate that was effectively running the country also endorsed Noboa. The Ecuadorean Congress then met in an emergency session in Guayaquil on the same day, January 22, and ratified Noboa as President of the Republic in constitutional succession to Mahuad.\n\nAlthough Ecuador began to improve economically in the following months, the government of Noboa came under heavy fire for the continuation of the dollarization policy, its disregard for social problems, and other important issues in Ecuadorean politics.\n\nRetired Colonel [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]], a member of the military junta that overthrew Mahuad, was elected president in 2002 and assumed the presidency on January 15, 2003. Gutierrez's [[January 21 Patriotic Society Party|Patriotic Society Party]] had a small fraction of the seats in Congress and therefore depended on the support of other parties in Congress to pass legislation.\n\nIn December 2004, Guti\u00e9rrez unconstitutionally dissolved the Supreme Court and appointed new judges to it. This move was generally seen as a kickback to deposed ex-President Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram, whose political party had sided with Guti\u00e9rrez and helped derail attempts to impeach him in late 2004. The new Supreme Court dropped charges of corruption pending against the exiled Bucaram, who soon returned to the politically unstable country. The [[political corruption|corruption]] evident in these maneuvers finally led Quito's middle classes to seek the ousting of Guti\u00e9rrez in early 2005. In April 2005, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces declared that it \"withdrew its support\" for the President. After weeks of public protests, Guti\u00e9rrez was overthrown in April. Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] assumed the Presidency and vowed to complete the term of office and hold elections in 2006.\n\nOn January 15, 2007, the social democrat [[Rafael Correa]] succeeded Palacio as President of Ecuador, with the promise of summoning a [[constituent assembly]] and bringing focus on poverty. The 2007-8 [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] drafted the [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador]], approved via the [[Ecuadorian constitutional referendum, 2008]].\n\nIn November 2009, Ecuador faced an [[2009 Ecuador electricity crisis|energy crisis]] that led to power rationing across the country.\n\n==See also==\n*[[1830 Constitution of Ecuador]]\n*[[2008 Constitution of Ecuador]]\n*[[Economic history of Ecuador]]\n*[[History of Latin America]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[Military history of Ecuador]]\n*[[Politics of Ecuador]]\n*[[President of Ecuador]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Andrien, Kenneth.

Ecuador encompasses a wide range of natural formations and climates, from the [[desert]]-like southern coast to the snowcapped peaks of the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] to the [[plain]]s of the [[Amazon Basin]]. [[Cotopaxi]] in Ecuador is one of the world's highest active [[volcano]]s. It also has a large series of rivers that follow the southern border and spill into the northwest area of Peru.\n\n== Area and borders ==\n\n{{Coord|2|00|S|77|30|W|type:country|display=title}}\n\nEcuador is located on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and has 2,237 km of [[coastline]]. It has 2237 km of land boundaries, with [[Colombia]] in the north (708&nbsp;km border) and Peru in the east and south (1,529&nbsp;km border).  \n\nEcuador has a total area is {{convert|283561|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, including the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. Of this, {{convert|276841|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|6720|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} water. Ecuador is one of the smaller countries in South America, slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]].\n\n== Cities ==\nThe capital and second most-populous city is [[Quito]], with a population of 1.4 million. The most-populous city is [[Guayaquil]] (2 million). Other important cities include [[Cuenca (Ecuador)|Cuenca]] (0.41 million), [[San Juan de Ambato|Ambato]] (0.28 million), [[Portoviejo]] (0.23 million), [[Machala]] (0.21 million), and [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]] (0.14 million).\n\n== Geographical regions ==\n\n{{Main|Regions of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|right|thumbnail|Extent of Ecuador's western [[EEZ]] in the Pacific]]\n\nEcuador is divided into three continental regions&mdash;the Costa (coast), Sierra (mountains), and Oriente (east)&mdash;and one insular region, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (officially Archipi\u00e9lago de Col\u00f3n). The continental regions extend the length of the country from north to south and are separated by the Andes Mountains.\n\n=== Gal\u00e1pagos Islands ===\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos are located 1,000&nbsp;km west of the Ecuadorian coast. They are noted for their association with [[Charles Darwin]], whose observation of animals here during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']] led to his formation of the theory of [[natural selection]] as a means of [[evolution]]. The islands have witnessed a large number of tourists and travellers over recent years. As a result, various hotels and restaurants are now flourishing in the area offering [http://naturegalapagos.com/land-tours/ tour packages] and [http://www.naturegalapagos.com/cruises/ cruise services.] Special species that could be found here include [[blue-footed booby|blue footed boobies]], [[Iguanidae|iguanas]] and many more. Internal flight services from Ecuador to Galapagos are also available for tourists making it more convenient for guests from outside.\n\n[[File:Black Turtle Cove - panorama.jpg|thumb|Panoramic of [[Black Turtle Cove]], Island of Santa Cruz, Galapagos.]]\n\n\n[[Image:School of Hammerhead sharks.jpg|thumb|right|School of scalloped hammerheads, [[Wolf Island]], [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]]][[Image:Sphyrna lewini galapagos.jpg|thumb|right|Another school of scalloped hammerheads at Wolf Island, Galapagos]]\n[[Image:Ecuador aguablanca sulfur laguna.jpg|thumb|Sulfur laguna on the site of AguaBlanca, Machalilla National Park, Ecuador]]\n[[File:Gigantic Turtle on the Island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos.JPG|277px|right|thumb|[[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]] on [[Santa Cruz Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)]]]]\n[[File:Fresh Water Swimming in the Galapagos on the Island of Santa Cruz.JPG|277px|thumb|right|Fresh water swimming in Puerto Ayora, Galapagos on the Island of Santa Cruz.]]\n\n=== La Costa ===\nThe western coastal area of Ecuador borders the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, encompasses a broad coastal plain, and then rises to the foothills of the [[Andes]] Mountains to the east. It is estimated that 98% of the native forest of coastal Ecuador has been eliminated in favor of cattle ranching and other agricultural production, including [[banana]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations. The forest fragments that still survive are primarily found along the coastal mountain ranges of Mache-Chindul, [[Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve|Jama-Coaque]], and Chongon-Colonche, and include tropical dry forest, tropical wet forest, tropical moist evergreen forest, premontane cloud forest, and mangrove forest. Collectively known as the [[Pacific Equatorial Forest]], these forest remnants are considered the most endangered tropical forest in the world, and are part of the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Hotspots|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/tumbes_choco/Pages/default.aspx|work=Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena|accessdate=13 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809042100/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/tumbes_choco/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=9 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  [[Guayaquil]], located on the southern part of the coast is the biggest city in the country. On the north coast of Ecuador the port of Balao in [[Esmeraldas (city)|Esmeraldas]] is used for oil export and the port of Manta was formerly used by the [[United States Air Force]] as a control point for narcotics traffic control until 2009.\n\n=== La Sierra ===\n\n[[Image:Imbabura des del sud.JPG|thumb|left|Mount Imbabura (Ecuador) from south-east]]\n\nThe central belt of Ecuador that includes the [[Andes]] Mountains, inland from the coast; with volcanoes and mountain peaks that sport year-round snow on the [[equator]]; many areas long since deforested by agriculture; a number of cut-flower growing operations; at a certain altitude zone may be found [[cloud forests]].\n\nThe northern Ecuadorian Andes are divided into three parallel [[cordillera]]s which run in what is similar to an S-shape from north to south: the western, central ([[Cordillera Real (Ecuador)|Cordillerra Real]]) and eastern ([[Cordillera Occidental (Ecuador)|Cordillera Occidental]]) cordilleras. The cordilleras were formed earlier in the [[Cenozoic]] era (the current geological era), as the [[Nazca Plate]] has [[subduction|subduct]]ed underneath the [[South American Plate]] and has raised the mountain range. In the south, the cordilleras are not well defined.\n\n[[Quito]], the capital city, is located in a high mountain valley on the foothills of the [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]]. The town of [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa|Ba\u00f1os]] features [[hot spring]]s swimming pools on the foothills of the [[Tungurahua]] in the Central Cordillera. The road from Ba\u00f1os to Puyo has long been known for its narrowness, curves and sheer drops (only one lane in some places, on one area, actually cut into the side of a cliff so that the cliff roofs over it). The most important east-west road across the Andes is the road from Quito to Lago Agrio, which is paved for most of its length yet is heavily traveled by tractor-trailers\u2014and the Trans-Ecuadorian Oil Pipeline serves as the guardrail for long stretches of this road.\n\n==== Notable Mountains and Volcanoes ====\n{{Volcanoes in Ecuador}}\n[[Image:Ecuador Chimborazo fromnorthwest.JPG|right|thumb|The volcano Chimborazo from the Northwest]]\n\n* [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] (6,267 m) inactive volcano, the furthest point from the Earth's center.\n* [[Cotopaxi]] (5,897 m) the second highest active volcano in the world.\n* [[Illiniza]] \t(5,248 m)\n* [[Tungurahua]] (5,023 m) It is an active volcano in eruption since 1998 near Ba\u00f1os-Tunguragua\n* [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]] (4,784 m) volcano overlooking Quito\n\nPartial, incomplete table of volcanoes in the north of the Ecuadorian Andes, from north to south:\n{| border cellspacing=0\n|-\n| West || Interandean || Center || East\n|-\n| Chiles<br />[[Yanaurcu (Ecuador)|Yanaurcu]]<br />[[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]]<br />[[Atacazo]]<br />[[Coraz\u00f3n (volcano)|Coraz\u00f3n]]<br />[[Carihuairazo]]<br />[[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] || [[Imbabura Volcano|Imbabura]]<br />[[Mojanda]]<br />Ilal\u00f3<br />[[Pasochoa]]<br />[[Rumi\u00f1ahui (volcano)|Rumi\u00f1ahui]]<br /> || [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]]<br />Saraurcu<br />Pambamarca<br />Filocorrales<br />[[Antisana]]<br />[[Sincholagua Volcano|Sincholahua]]<br />[[Cotopaxi]]<br />[[Tungurahua]]<br />[[El Altar|Altar]]|| [[Soche]]<br />[[Sumaco]]<br />[[Reventador]]<br />[[Sangay]]\n|}\n\n=== El Oriente (the East) Amazon Basin ===\n\nMuch of the Oriente is [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] (Spanish: ''la selva''), on the east slopes of the [[Andes]] Mountains and descending into the [[Amazon Basin]], with strikingly different upland rainforest with steep, rugged ridges and cascading streams (can be seen around [[Puyo, Pastaza|Puyo]]) and lowland rainforest. The oil fields are located in the Amazon basin, headquartered at [[Lago Agrio]]; some of the rainforest has been seriously damaged in this region and environmental degradation is severe, with catastrophic oil pollution in some areas. Some 38% of Ecuador's land is forested,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Ecuador.htm |title=Ecuador Forest Information and Data |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> and despite a 1.5% annual deforestation rate remains one of the most [[biodiversity|biodiverse]] locations on the planet. The Oriente is also home to a large number of Ecuador's indigenous groups, notably the lowland [[Quechuas|Quechua]], [[Siona people|Siona]], [[Secoya people|Secoya]], [[Huaorani]], and [[Cof\u00e1n]].\n[[File:Andes Mountains South America Photograph 022.JPG|thumb|Imbabura Volcano photographed in black and white.]]\n\n== Drainage ==\n\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n\n[[Image:Ecuador Pastazas near Banos.JPG|thumb|left|Pastazas river near Ba\u00f1os, Ecuador]]\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador rise in the Sierra region and flow east toward the Amazon River or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the Andes to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\nIn the Costa region, the Costa Externa has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the Costa Externa from the Costa Internal and the Sierra on their way to the Pacific Ocean. The Costa Internal, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nThe Guayas River system, which flows southward to the Gulf of Guayaquil, constitutes the most important of the drainage systems in the Costa Internal. The Guayas River Basin, including land drained by its tributaries, is 40,000 square kilometers in area. The sixty-kilometer-long Guayas River forms just north of Guayaquil out of the confluence of the Babahoyo and Daule rivers. Briefly constricted at Guayaquil by hills, the Guayas widens south of the city and flows through a deltaic network of small islands and channels. At its mouth, the river forms a broad estuary with two channels around Pun\u00e1 Island, the deeper of which is used for navigation.\n\nThe second major Costa river system\u2014the Esmeraldas\u2014rises in the Hoya de Quito in the Sierra as the Guayllabamba River and flows westward to empty into the Pacific Ocean near the city of Esmeraldas. The Esmeraldas River is 320 kilometers long and has a 20,000-square-kilometer drainage basin.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at sixty-one meters is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the Eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 meters. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the Amazon River. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs.\n\n== Climate ==\n\n{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\n[[Image:Ecuador ParamosnearAmbato.JPG|thumb|Paramo meadows near Ambato, Ecuador]]\n\nEach region has different factors that affect its climate. The Costa is influenced primarily by proximity to warm or cool ocean currents. By contrast, climate in the Sierra varies more as a function of altitude. The Oriente has a fairly uniform climate that varies only slightly between the two subregions. Climate in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is both moderated by the ocean currents and affected by altitude. Throughout Ecuador variation in rainfall primarily determines seasons. Temperature is determined by altitude. With each ascent of {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in altitude, temperature drops {{convert|1|C-change}}. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the Sierra.\n\n\n\n\n=== The Sierra ===\n\nTemperatures in the Sierra do not vary greatly on a seasonal basis; the hottest month averages {{convert|16|\u00b0C|1}} and the coolest month, {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} in the upper elevations. Diurnal temperatures, however, vary dramatically, from cold mornings to hot afternoons. The almost vertical sun and the rarefied air in the higher Sierra region allow the land to warm quickly during the day and lose heat quickly at night. Mornings typically are bright and sunny, whereas afternoons often are cloudy and rainy. In general, rainfall amounts are highest on exposed locations at lower altitudes. Rain can also vary on a local basis. Sheltered valleys normally receive {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year, whereas annual rainfall is {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in Quito and can reach {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} on exposed slopes that catch rain-bearing winds. On a seasonal basis, the driest months are June through September.\n\nThe climate in the Sierra is divided into levels based on altitude. The tropical level\u2014{{convert|400|to|1800|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures ranging from {{convert|20|to|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and heavy precipitation. The subtropical level\u2014{{convert|1800|to|2500|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2014has temperatures from {{convert|15|to|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and moderate precipitation. The temperate level\u2014\u2264{{convert|2500|to|3200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}\u2265- -has a year-round temperature in the range of {{convert|10|to|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and an annual rainfall of {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. The temperate level experiences rainstorms, hailstorms, and fog. Winter, or the rainy season, lasts from January through June, and the dry season or summer from July through December. Most rain falls in April. There also is a short rainy period in early October caused by moisture penetrating the Sierra from the Oriente. Quito and most other populated areas in the Sierra are located at this temperate level. The cold level extends from the temperate zone to {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Here, average temperatures are {{convert|3|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the precipitation often appears in the form of rain, hail, and thick fog. Above {{convert|4650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is the frozen level, where peaks are constantly capped with snow and ice, and temperatures range from below {{convert|0|to|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Precipitation frequently is in the form of snow, fog, and rain.\n\n=== The Oriente/Amazon Basin ===\n\nThe Eastern lowlands in the Oriente experience abundant rainfall, especially in the Andean piedmont, sometimes exceeding {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Temperatures average {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} in the western parts of this region. The jungle-covered plains of the Eastern lowlands register high levels of rainfall and temperatures surpassing {{convert|28|\u00b0C|1}}.\n\nBeing located on the equator, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands would have an equatorial climate were it not for the modifying effects of the Peruvian Current. Instead, climate on the islands follows a pattern more like that of the Sierra than the Costa. At sea level, the land is desertlike with temperatures of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}}. The eight summer months experience no precipitation, whereas the winter months of January through April have some fog and drizzle. [[Above mean sea level|Above sea level]] to an altitude of {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, the islands have a mixture of tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates. In general, temperatures are around {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}}. There is constant fog and drizzle in the summer and rain in the winter. The cold level above {{convert|450|m|ft|0|sp=us}} has temperatures below {{convert|14|\u00b0C|1}}. It is cool along the tropical coast.\n\n== Elevation extremes ==\n\n* lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m\n* highest point: [[Chimborazo]] 6,267 m\n\n== Natural resources ==\nEcuador has land which is rich in petroleum.

Ecuador is a multiethnic society, a home to people of various ethnic origins; as a result, Ecuadorians do not equate their nationality with their ethnicity, but rather their allegiance or affinity for Ecuador. Majority of Ecuadorians trace their origins to one or more of three geographical sources of [[human migration]]s to the territory of modern Ecuador: the [[pre-Hispanic]] [[Pre-Columbian South America|indigenous populations]] who settled the region over 15,000 years ago, the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s (principally [[Spaniards]] which are also the source of the [[Spanish language]]) who arrived over five centuries ago, and ultimately the [[Black Ecuadorians|sub-Saharan Africans]] who were imported to [[New Spain]] as [[slaves]] during the same period. The mixing of two or more of these three groups established other mixed ethnic groups.\n\n''[[Mestizo]]s'', the multiracial group of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups and comprise around 71.9% of the current population. [[White people|Whites]] are estimated at 6.1% and consist largely of those of unmixed or predominant European descent.<ref>[http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html Poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC]. (Census results, in Spanish) eluniverso.com (2011-09-02)</ref> Most white Ecuadorians are of colonial-era Spanish origin, also known as ''[[criollo people|criollos]]'' (literally meaning \"local-born Spaniards\", as opposed to \"[[Peninsulares]]\", which were Spaniards born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in Spain. They also include descendants of immigrants from Italy, Germany, and France, as well as other countries.  The third most numerous group are the indigenous [[Amerindians]], who account for approximately 7% of the population. [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|Afro-Ecuadorians]] make up most of the balance of the percentage and include [[mulattos]] (mixed European and sub-Saharan African) and [[zambos]] (mixed indigenous and sub-Saharan African).\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref>{{cite web|title=EVOLUCI\u00d3N DE LAS VARIABLES INVESTIGADAS EN LOS CENSOS DE POBLACI\u00d3N Y VIVIENDA DEL ECUADOR|url=http://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/documentos/web-inec/Publicaciones/Evolucion_variables_1950_2010_24_04_2014.pdf|website=Ecuador en Cifras|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n|1950 | 3202757\n|1962 | 4467007\n|1974 | 6521710\n|1982 | 8060712\n|1990 | 9648189\n|2001 | 12156608\n|2010 | 14483499\n|2017 | 16554812\n}}\n\n===Census data===\nThe '''Ecuadorian census''' is conducted by the [[Politics of Ecuador|governmental institution]] known as ''INEC'', ''Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos'' (National Institute of Statistics and Census).<ref name=\"inec.gob.ec\">INEC https://web.archive.org/web/20110201014932/http://www.inec.gob.ec/preliminares/somos.html</ref> The census in Ecuador is conducted every ten years, and its objective is to obtain the number of people residing within its borders.

Today's population is distributed more evenly between the \"Sierra\" and the \"Costa\" (the coastal lowlands)region. Migration towards the cities\u2014particularly larger cities\u2014in all regions has increased the urban population to about 55 percent.\n\nThe \"Oriente\" region, consisting of Amazonian lowlands to the East of the Andes and covering about half the country's land area, remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the country's population, that for the most are indigenous peoples who maintain a wary distance from the recent mestizo and white settlers. The territories of the \"Oriente\" are home to as many as nine indigenous groups: [[Quichua]], [[Shuar people|Shuar]], [[Achuar people|Achuar]], [[Huaorani]], [[Siona people|Siona]], [[Siona people|Secoya]], [[Shiwiar]], and [[Cofan]], all represented politically by the [[CONFENIAE|Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, CONFENIAE]].\n\nAs a result of the oil exploration and the development of the infrastructure required for the exploitation of the oil fields in the eastern jungles during the seventies and early eighties, there was a wave of settlement in the region. The Majority of these wave of internal immigration came from the southern province of Loja as a result of a drought that lasted three years and affected the southern provinces of the country. This boom of the petroleum industry has led to a mushrooming of the town of [[Lago Agrio]] ([[Nueva Loja]]) as well as substantial [[deforestation]] and pollution of wetlands and lakes.\n\n==Nationality, ethnicity, and race==\nThere are five major '''ethnic groups in Ecuador''': [[mestizo]], [[White Latin American|white]], [[Afroecuatoriano|Afroecuadorian]], [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Amerindian]], and Montubio.  Mestizos constitute more than 70% of the population.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ethnic composition of Ecuador<ref name=ethn>[http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html Poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC]. eluniverso.com.

The mix of these groups is described as [[mestizo]] or [[cholo]]. Censuses do not record ethnic affiliation, which in any event remains fluid; thus, estimates of the numbers of each group should be taken only as approximations. In the 1980s, Indians and mestizos represented the bulk of the population, with each group accounting for roughly 40 percent of total population. Whites represented 10 to 15 percent and blacks the remaining 5 percent.<ref name=overview>{{csref|country=ecuador|section=Ethnic Groups|author=Patricia Kluck}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kluck, writing in 1989, ethnic groups in Ecuador have had a traditional hierarchy of white, [[mestizo]], blacks, and then others.<ref name=whites>{{csref | country = ecuador| section = Whites and Mestizos| author  = Patricia Kluck}}</ref> Her review depicts this hierarchy as a consequence of colonial attitudes and of the terminology of colonial legal distinctions. Spanish-born persons residing in the New World (peninsulares) were at the top of the social hierarchy, followed by [[criollo people|criollos]], born of two Spanish parents in the colonies. The 19th century usage of mestizo was to denote a person whose parents were an Indian and a white; a [[cholo]] had one Indian and one mestizo parent. By the 20th century, mestizo and cholo were frequently used interchangeably. Kluck suggested that societal relationships, occupation, manners, and clothing all derived from ethnic affiliation.<ref name=whites/>\n\nNonetheless, according to Kluck, individuals could potentially switch ethnic affiliation if they had culturally adapted to the recipient group; such switches were made without resort to subterfuge.<ref name=whites/> Moreover, the precise criteria for defining ethnic groups varies considerably. The vocabulary that more prosperous mestizos and whites used in describing ethnic groups mixes social and biological characteristics. Ethnic affiliation thus is dynamic; Indians often become mestizos, and prosperous mestizos seek to improve their status sufficiently to be considered whites. Ethnic identity reflects numerous characteristics, only one of which is physical appearance; others include dress, language, community membership, and self-identification.<ref name=overview/>\n\nA geography of ethnicity remained well-defined until the surge in migration that began in the 1950s. Whites resided primarily in larger cities. Mestizos lived in small towns scattered throughout the countryside. Indians formed the bulk of the Sierra rural populace, although mestizos filled this role in the areas with few Indians. Most blacks lived in [[Esmeraldas Province]], with small enclaves found in the Carchi and Imbabura provinces. Pressure on Sierra land resources and the dissolution of the traditional hacienda, however, increased the numbers of Indians migrating to the Costa, the Oriente, and the cities. By the 1980s, Sierra Indians\u2014or Indians in the process of switching their ethnic identity to that of mestizos\u2014lived on Costa plantations, in Quito, Guayaquil, and other cities, and in colonization areas in the Oriente and the Costa. Indeed, Sierra Indians residing in the coastal region substantially outnumbered the remaining original Costa inhabitants, the Cayapa and Colorado Indians. In the late 1980s, analysts estimated that there were only about 4,000 Cayapas and Colorados. Some blacks had migrated from the remote region of the Ecuadorian-Colombian border to the towns and cities of Esmeraldas.<ref name=overview/>\n\n===Afro-Ecuadorian===\n{{Main|Afro-Ecuadorian people}}\nAfro-Ecuadorians are an [[ethnic group]] in Ecuador who are descendants of black African slaves brought by the Spanish during their conquest of Ecuador from the [[Inca]]s. They make up from 3% to 5% of Ecuador's population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2010/06/ecuador_dreamto.html|title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Rough Cut . Ecuador: Dreamtown \u2013 PBS|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nEcuador has a population of about 1,120,000 descendants from African people. The Afro-Ecuadorian culture is found primarily in the country's northwest coastal region. Africans form a majority (70%) in the province of [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]] and also have an important concentration in the [[Valle del Chota]] in the [[Imbabura Province]]. They can be also found in important numbers in [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].\n\n=== Indigenous ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}\n\n====Sierra Indians====\n[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|left|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]\nSierra Indians had an estimated population of 1.5 to 2 million in the early 1980s and live in the intermontane valleys of the Andes. Prolonged contact with Hispanic culture, which dates back to the conquest, has had a homogenizing effect, reducing the variation among the indigenous Sierra tribes.<ref name=sierra>{{csref\n| country = ecuador\n| section = Sierra Indians\n| author  = Patricia Kluck\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Indians of the Sierra are separated from whites and mestizos by a castelike gulf. They are marked as a disadvantaged group; to be an Indian or ind\u00edgena in Ecuador is to be stigmatized. Indians are usually poor and frequently illiterate, they enjoy limited participation in national institutions, and they command access to few of the social and economic opportunities available to more privileged groups.<ref name=sierra/>\n\nVisible markers of ethnic affiliation, especially hairstyle, dress, and language, separate Indians from the rest of the populace. Indians wore more manufactured items by the late 1970s than previously; their clothing, nonetheless, was distinct from that of other rural inhabitants. Indians in communities relying extensively on wage labor sometimes assumed Western-style dress while still maintaining their Indian identity. Indians speak Quichua\u2014a Quechua dialect\u2014although most are bilingual, speaking Spanish as a second language with varying degrees of facility. By the late 1980s, some younger Indians no longer learned Quichua.<ref name=sierra/>\n\n====Oriente Indians====\n[[File:Huaorani village.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huaorani]] village]]\nAlthough the Indians of the Oriente first came into contact with whites in the 16th century, the encounters were more sporadic than those of most of the country's indigenous population. Until the 19th century, most non-Indians entering the region were either traders or missionaries. Beginning in the 1950s, however, the government built roads and encouraged settlers from the Sierra to colonize the Amazon River Basin. Virtually all remaining Indians were brought into increasing contact with national society. The interaction between Indians and outsiders had a profound impact on the indigenous way of life.<ref name=oriente>{{csref\n| country = ecuador\n| section = Oriente Indians\n| author  = Patricia Kluck\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1970s, roughly 30,000 Quichua speakers and 15,000 J\u00edvaros lived in Oriente Indian communities. Quichua speakers (sometimes referred to as the Yumbos) grew out of the detribalization of members of many different groups after the Spanish conquest. Subject to the influence of Quichua-speaking missionaries and traders, various elements of the Yumbos adopted the tongue as a lingua franca and gradually lost their previous languages and tribal origins. Yumbos were scattered throughout the Oriente, whereas the J\u00edvaros\u2014subdivided into the Shuar and the Achuar\u2014were concentrated in southeastern Ecuador. Some also lived in northeastern Peru. Traditionally, both groups relied on migration to resolve intracommunity conflict and to limit the ecological damage to the tropical forest caused by slash-and-burn agriculture.<ref name=oriente/>\n\nBoth the Yumbos and the J\u00edvaros depended on agriculture as their primary means of subsistence. [[Manioc]], the main staple, was grown in conjunction with a wide variety of other fruits and vegetables. Yumbo men also resorted to wage labor to obtain cash for the few purchases deemed necessary. By the mid-1970s, increasing numbers of Quichua speakers settled around some of the towns and missions of the Oriente. Indians themselves had begun to make a distinction between Christian and jungle Indians. The former engaged in trade with townspeople. The J\u00edvaros, in contrast to the Christian Quichua speakers, lived in more remote areas. Their mode of horticulture was similar to that of the non-Christian Yumbos, although they supplemented crop production with hunting and some livestock raising.<ref name=oriente/>\n\nShamans ([[curandero]]s) played a pivotal role in social relations in both groups. As the main leaders and the focus of local conflicts, shamans were believed to both cure and kill through magical means. In the 1980s group conflicts between rival shamans still erupted into full-scale feuds with loss of life.<ref name=oriente/>\n\nThe Oriente Indian population dropped precipitously during the initial period of intensive contact with outsiders. The destruction of their crops by mestizos laying claim to indigenous lands, the rapid exposure to diseases to which Indians lacked immunity, and the extreme social disorganization all contributed to increased mortality and decreased birth rates. One study of the Shuar in the 1950s found that the group between ten and nineteen years of age was smaller than expected. This was the group that had been youngest and most vulnerable during the initial contact with national society. Normal population growth rates began to reestablish themselves after approximately the first decade of such contact.<ref name=oriente/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Ecuadorian dress, Carnival del Pueblo 2010, London.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|A mestizo woman in Ecuadorian garment participating in the 2010 [[Carnaval del Pueblo]].]]\n{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}\n\nEcuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions, and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains of South America, given the subjugation of the indigenous people through evangelism and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador.{{dubious| date=May 2015}}\n\nEcuador's indigenous communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080502041028/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm South-images.com] ''Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador''</ref> but some may also practice their own indigenous cultures, particularly the more remote indigenous communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population, and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish, though many speak Amerindian languages such as [[Kichwa]]. Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Ecuador}}\nAccording to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census, 91.95% of the country's population have a religion, 7.94% are [[Atheism|atheists]] and 0.11% are agnostics. Among those with a religion, 80.44% are [[Roman Catholic]], 11.30% are [[Protestants]], and 8.26% other (mainly Jewish, Buddhists and Latter-day Saints).<ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101377532/-1/El_80%25_de_ecuatorianos_es_cat%C3%B3lico.html#.UGyc6k3LQ5w El 80% de ecuatorianos es cat\u00f3lico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811033609/http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101377532/-1/El_80%25_De_ecuatorianos_es_cat%C3%B3lico.html#.UGyc6k3LQ5w |date=11 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{es icon}} [http://www.eluniverso.com/2012/08/15/1/1382/80-ecuatorianos-afirma-ser-catolico-segun-inec.html El 80% de los ecuatorianos afirma ser cat\u00f3lico, seg\u00fan el INEC]</ref>\n\nIn the rural parts of Ecuador, indigenous beliefs and Catholicism are sometimes [[syncretism|syncretized]].

[[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music.\" Through the years, many cultures have influenced to establish new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] highly established in afro-Ecuadorian society like [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], and so on.\n[[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of foreign cultures influence. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is Sanjuanito. It is originally from the North of Ecuador ([[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a danceable music used in the festivities of the mestizo and indigenous culture. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by indigenous people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on 24 June, coincidentally the same date when indigenous people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Ceviche ecuador.JPG|thumb|left|Ecuadorian ''[[ceviche]]'', made of shrimp and lemon, onions and some herbs. Tomato sauce and orange are used at some places, but does not form a part of the basic recipe]]\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup, a second course which includes rice and a protein such as meat or fish, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter, and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn or [[corn nut|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]] which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of bananas, cacao beans (to make chocolate), shrimp, tilapia, mangos and passion fruit, among other products.\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including bananas, tree grapes, and peach palms.\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja,Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ALHI/article/viewFile/ALHI7272110053A/25162 Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972]</ref> an indigenous chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of the [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any indigenous language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned, and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito, and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include: [[Eugenio Espejo]] a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled [[La victoria de Junin|''La Victoria de Junin'']]; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; [[Luis A.

[[Ecuadorian painters]] include: [[Eduardo Kingman]], [[Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn]] and [[Camilo Egas]] from the Indiginist Movement; [[Manuel Rendon]], [[Jaime Zapata]], [[Enrique T\u00e1bara]], [[An\u00edbal Villac\u00eds]], [[Theo Constante]], Le\u00f3n Ricaurte and [[Estuardo Maldonado]] from the Informalist Movement; and [[Luis Burgos Flor]] with his abstract, Futuristic style. The indigenous people of Tigua, Ecuador are also world-renowned for their [[Culture of Ecuador#Indigenous art of Tigua|traditional paintings]].\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Ecuador}}\n[[File:Perez-flag.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Jefferson P\u00e9rez]], Olympian Gold Medalist.]]\n[[File:Estadio Monumental 6.JPG|thumb|Estadio Monumental of Guayaquil.]]\n[[File:N Lapentti 2009 Davis Cup 1.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Nicol\u00e1s Lapentti]]\nThe most popular [[sport in Ecuador]], as in most South American countries, is football (soccer).

Currently the most successful football club in Ecuador is [[LDU Quito]], and it is the only Ecuadorian club that have won the ''[[Copa Libertadores]]'', the ''[[Copa Sudamericana]]'' and the ''[[Recopa Sudamericana]]''; they were also runners-up in the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]]. The matches of the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuadorian national team]] are the most-watched sporting events in the country. Ecuador qualified for the final rounds of both the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants. Ecuador finished in 2nd place on the qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champion, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] to come in second to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup. [[Futsal]], often referred to as ''\u00edndor'', is particularly popular for mass participation.\n\nThere is considerable interest in tennis in the middle and upper classes of Ecuadorian society, and several Ecuadorian professional players have attained international fame. Basketball has a high profile, while Ecuador's specialties include [[Ecuavolley]], a three-person variation of volleyball. Bullfighting is practiced at a professional level in Quito, during the annual festivities that commemorate the Spanish founding of the city, and it also features in festivals in many smaller towns. [[Rugby union]] is found to some extent in Ecuador, with teams in Guayaquil, Quito and Cuenca.\n\nEcuador has won only two medals in the Olympic Games, both gained by 20&nbsp;km racewalker [[Jefferson P\u00e9rez]], who took gold in the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] games, and silver [[2008 Summer Olympics|12 years later]].

Many other Ecuadorians have emigrated across Latin America, thousands have gone to Japan and Australia. One famous American of [[Ecuadorian American|Ecuadorian]] descent is pop music vocalist [[Christina Aguilera]].\n\nIn Ecuador there are about 100,000 Americans and over 30,000 [[European Union]] expatriates. They move to Ecuador for business opportunities and as cheaper place for retirement.\n\nAs a result of the political conflict in [[Colombia]] and of the criminal gangs that had appeared in the areas of power vacuum a constant flow of refugees and asylum seekers as well as economic migrants of [[Colombian people|Colombian origin]] had moved into Ecuadorian territory. Over the last decade at least 45,000 displaced people are now residents in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian government and international organizations are assisting them. According to the [[UNHCR]] 2009 report as many as 167,189 [[refugee]]s and [[asylum seekers]] are temporary residents in Ecuador.<ref>{{cite web|format=ZIP |url=http://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends/2009-Global-Tends-annex.zip |title=Table 1.

Those jobs are mostly in agriculture and unskilled labor. There are no official statistics but some press reports estimate their number into the tens of thousands.\n\nThere is a diverse community of [[Middle Eastern peoples|Middle Eastern]] Ecuadorians, numbering in the tens of thousands, mostly from [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrians|Syrian]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent; prominent in commerce and industry, and concentrated in the coastal cities of [[Guayaquil]], [[Quevedo, Ecuador|Quevedo]] and [[Machala]]. They are well assimilated into the local culture and are referred commonly as \"[[Turkish people|turcos]]\" since the early migrants of these communities arrived with passports issued by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the beginning of the century.\n'''See also:''' [[Lebanese people in Ecuador]].\n\nEcuador is also home to communities of [[Spaniards]], Italians, [[Germans]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], French, [[British people|Britons]] and [[Greeks|Greek]]-Ecuadorians. Ecuadorian [[Jews]], who number around 450 are mostly of German or Italian descent. There are 225,000 English speakers and 112,000 German speakers in Ecuador of which the great majority reside in [[Quito]], mainly all descendants of immigrants who arrived in the late 19th century and of retired emigrees that returned to their terroir. Most of the descendants of European immigrants strive for the preservation of their heritage. Therefore, some groups even have their own schools (e.g. [[German School Guayaquil]] and German School Quito), Lice\u00e9 La Condamine (French Heritage), Alberto Einstein (Jewish Heritage) and [[The British School of Quito]] (Anglo-British), cultural and social organizations, churches and country clubs. Their contribution for the social, political and economical development of the country is immense, specially in relation to their percentage in the total population. Most of the families of European heritage belong to the Ecuadorian upper class and had married into the wealthiest families of the country.\n\nThere is also a small Asian-Ecuadorian (see [[Asian Latino]]) community estimated in a range from 2,500 to 25,000, mainly consists of those having any amount of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] [[Yun'an District|Yunan]] and [[Han Chinese|Han]] descent, and possibly 10,000 being Japanese whose ancestors arrived as miners, farm hands and fishermen in the late 19th century.

The central government polity is a four-yearly [[republic|elected]] [[presidential system|presidential]], unicameral [[representative democracy]]. The [[President of Ecuador]] is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] on a [[multi-party system]], leading a cabinet with further [[executive power]]. [[Legislative power]] is not limited to the [[National Assembly (Ecuador)|National Assembly]] as it may to a lesser degree be exercised by the executive which consists of the President convening an appointed executive cabinet.  Subsequent acts of the National Assembly are supreme over Executive Orders where sufficient votes have been cast by the legislators. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.There is also constitutional republic\n\nThe [[constitution of Ecuador]] provides for a four-year term of office for the President, Vice President, and members of the National Assembly with concurrent elections. Presidents and legislators may be re-elected immediately. Citizens must be at least 16 years of age to vote: [[suffrage]] is universal and compulsory for literate persons aged 18 to 65 and optional for 16 and 17 years of age and other eligible voters.\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Ecuador as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|hybrid regime]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==Political conditions==\nEcuador's [[political party|political parties]] have historically been small, loose organizations that depended more on populist, often charismatic, leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeff|date=2008|title=Vectors of Contestation: Social Movements and Party Systems in Ecuador and Colombia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270512275_Vectors_of_Contestation_Social_Movements_and_Party_Systems_in_Ecuador_and_Colombia|journal=Latin American Essays|volume=21|pages=46\u201365|via=}}</ref> Frequent internal splits have produced extreme factionalism. However, a pattern has emerged in which administrations from the center-left alternate with those from the center-right. Although Ecuador's political [[elite]] is highly factionalized along regional, ideological, and personal lines, a strong desire for consensus on major issues often leads to compromise. Opposition forces in Congress are loosely organized, but historically they often unite to block the administration's initiatives and to remove cabinet ministers.\n\nConstitutional changes enacted by a specially elected National Constitutional Assembly in 1998 took effect on August 10, 1998. The new constitution strengthens the executive branch by eliminating mid-term congressional elections and by circumscribing Congress' power to challenge cabinet ministers. Party discipline is traditionally weak, and routinely many deputies switch allegiance during each Congress. However, after the new Constitution took effect, the Congress passed a Code of Ethics which imposes penalties on members who defy their party leadership on key votes.\n\nBeginning with the 1996 election, the more indigenous, less Spanish-rooted, ethnic groups abandoned their traditional policy of shunning the official political system and participated actively. The indigenous population has established itself as a significant force in Ecuadorian politics, as shown by the selection of indigenous representative [[Nina Pacari]], who led the indigenous political party, Pachakutik, as second vice president of the 1998 Congress.\n\nA presidential [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election]] was held on October 15 and November 26, 2006. [[Rafael Correa]] defeated [[Alvaro Noboa]] in a [[Two-round system|run-off election]], or second and final round. Correa won with 56.8% of the vote.<ref>\"Ecuador Exit Polls Show Correa Wins Presidential Vote (Update2)\" Bloomberg</ref> There was an [[2010 Ecuador crisis|attempted coup]] against President Rafael Correa in 2010. Correa became the first president in decades to win re-election and complete multiple full terms.  He enjoyed a long period of sustained high approval ratings and stability before plummeting oil prices, proposed tax increases, and accusations of increasingly authoritarian behavior sparked protests and eroded his popularity in the final two years of his presidency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/08/26/trial-by-fire-for-ecuadors-president-correa/|title=Trial by Fire for Ecuador\u2019s President Correa|date=2015-08-26|website=www.counterpunch.org|access-date=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Judicial branch==\nNew justices of the Supreme Court are elected by the sitting members of the court.  A bare majority of Congress, acting in a special session called by former President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] in December 2004, ousted 27 of the 31 justices and replaced them with new members chosen by Congress, notwithstanding the lack of any provisions permitting impeachment of Supreme Court justices by Congress and the specific provisions giving the Court the power to select new members. Earlier, in November 2004, Congress replaced the majority of judges on the country's Electoral Court and Constitutional Court by a similar process.\n\nAfter the adoption of a new Constitution in 2008, the judicial branch of the country was completely renewed. Now it has a cooperative leadership having a judicial and an administrative head. First you have the National Court of Justice, which seats 21 judges elected for a period of 9 years. They are elected by the Judiciary Council based on a merits contest held by that office. They are the final stage of any judicial process serving as a Court of Cassation and create binding precedent based on Triple Reiterative Rulings from the Chambers of the Court. The President of the Court is elected amongst the members of the Court for a Period of 3 years where he will represent the Judicial Branch before the State. The current president of the National Court of Justice is Dr. Carlos Ruiz.\n\nSecond, you have the administrative branch of the Judicial Power, which consists of The Judiciary Council. The Council is formed by 9 Vocals who are elected by the Branch of Transparency and Social Control, which is formed by the Control Authorities of the State. The Vocals are elected also by a merits contest and it shall be formed by six experts in law and 3 experts in management, economics and other related areas. However, after the National Referendum that took place on May 5, 2011, the proposition impulsed by the government of Mr. Correa won and now the Judiciary Council change its formation making a constitutional amendment. Currently a Tri-Party Commission is serving as a Transitional Council with delegates from the Legislative, Executive and Transparency Branch, to reform the broken judicial system of the Country.\n\nFinally it is wise to say that there exist a Constitutional Court. However it does not exercise legal revision, but rather constitutional control of situations where constitutional rights are violated. Also they are the sole body in the State to interpret what the Constitution says.\n\n==Executive branch==\n[[Image:Carondelet - Quito.JPG|thumb|[[Carondelet Palace]], seats the [[executive power]].]]\n[[File:CENA LENIN MORENO (16217113764) (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Current President of Ecuador, [[Len\u00edn Moreno]]]]\n{{office-table}}\n|President\n|[[Len\u00edn Moreno]]\n|[[Alianza Pa\u00eds]]\n|24 May 2017\n|-\n|Vice President\n|[[Jorge Glas]]\n|[[Alianza Pa\u00eds]]\n|24 May 2013\n|}\nThe president and vice president are elected on the same ticket by popular vote for four-year term; [[Lucio Gutierrez|Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] was dramatically removed by an act of Congress on 20 April 2005; election last held 20 October 2002; runoff election held 24 November 2002 (next to be held 2006)\n\nThe executive branch includes 28 ministries. Provincial governors and councilors, like mayors and aldermen and parish boards, are directly elected. Congress meets throughout the year except for recess in July and December. There are 20 seven-member congressional committees.\n\nFormer Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] assumed the presidency on April 20, 2005 after Congress removed [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] amid escalating street protests precipitated by growing criticism of Guti\u00e9rrez Supreme Court appointments.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Legislative branch==\n\nEcuador has a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly (Ecuador)|National Assembly]] (''Asamblea Nacional'' in Spanish). It has 137 members, which are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.  It is based on provincial [[constituency|constituencies]], but it also has members coming from a national list and it has members representing the emigrant community.\n\n===History===\nOn November 29, 2007 the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] dismissed [[National Congress (Ecuador)|Congress]] on charges of corruption and then assumed legislative powers for itself. The Constituent Assembly then proposed a new National Assembly, which is the current institution.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Ecuador|Elections in Ecuador}}\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nEcuador is divided into 24 provinces: [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Bol\u00edvar Province, Ecuador|Bol\u00edvar]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Cotopaxi Province|Cotopaxi]], [[El Oro Province|El Oro]], [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]], [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], [[Guayas Province|Guayas]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja (province)|Loja]], [[Los R\u00edos Province|Los R\u00edos]], [[Manab\u00ed Province|Manab\u00ed]], [[Morona-Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province, Ecuador|Pastaza]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], [[Santa Elena Province|Santa Elena]], [[Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas]], [[Sucumbios|Sucumb\u00edos]], [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]], [[Zamora-Chinchipe]]\n[[Santa Elena Province]]\n\n==Legal system==\nEcuador's legal system is based on the civil law system. Ecuador recently accepted compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction.\n\n==Female representation in the Assembly==\n\nIn 1979, there was no female representation, in 1984 it was only 4.2%, with three deputies, and in 1986 it was reduced to one female parliamentarian. Between 1988 and 1996 the average was around of 5%. It increased from 1998 : 13% in 1998, 18% in 2003, 26% in 2006, 35% in 2007, 29% in 2009 and 42% in 2013. In 2017, the leadership is led by three women: [[Gabriela Rivadeneira]], president; [[Rosana Alvarado]], first vice president and [[Marcela Agui\u00f1aga]], second vice

shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money transfers from nearly a million Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad. In 2002, oil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 40% of export earnings. Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of bananas ($936.5 million in 2002) and a major exporter of shrimp ($251 million in 2002). Exports of non-traditional products such as [[flower industry|flowers]] ($291 million in 2002) and canned fish ($333 million in 2002) have grown in recent years. Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Economy 1998\u20132006==\nDeteriorating economic performance in 1997\u201398 culminated in a [[1998\u201399 Ecuador banking crisis|severe financial crisis in 1999]]. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks, including the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global [[oil price]]s in 1997\u201398, and international emerging market instability in 1997\u201398. These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in a 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a 65% [[devaluation]] of the national currency in 1999.\n\nOn January 9, 2000, the administration of President [[Jamil Mahuad]] announced its intention to [[dollarization|adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency]] of Ecuador to address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the [[2000 Ecuadorean coup d'\u00e9tat]] which saw Mahuad's removal from office and the elevation of Vice President [[Gustavo Noboa]] to the presidency.\n\nThe Noboa government confirmed its commitment to convert to the dollar as the centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy, successfully completing the transition from [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]]s to dollars in 2001. Following the completion of a one-year stand-by program with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in December 2001, Ecuador successfully negotiated a new $205 million stand-by agreement with the IMF in March 2003.\n\nBuoyed by higher oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2000\u201301, with GDP rising 2.3% in 2000 and 5.4% in 2001. GDP growth leveled off to 3.3% in 2002. Although final figures are not yet available, it is expected to fall further, to about 1.7%, for 2003. GDP growth is estimated to recover to over 4% in 2004, due largely to expanded oil exports. Inflation fell from an annual rate of 96.1% in 2000 to an annual rate of 37.7% in 2001; 12.6% for 2002. Despite recent gains, 40% of the population lives below the poverty line, more than double the rate five years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/ecuador/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html|title=Ecuador Inflation rate (consumer prices)|publisher=Index Mundi|date=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe completion of the second [[Transandean Oil Pipeline]] (OCP in Spanish) in 2003 enabled Ecuador to expand oil exports.

However, on 11 July 2012 the government passed a new telecommunications regulation, requiring that Internet service providers fulfill all information requests from the superintendent of telecommunications, allowing access to client addresses and information without a judicial order.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204448 \"Ecuador\"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. department of State.

Attempts to censor statements made in times of heightened political sensitivity have been reported, as have alleged instances of censorship via the overly broad application of [[copyright]] to content critical of the government. Lawsuits have been filed against digital news sites for comments critical of the government. In order to utilize the services provided by cybercafes, the national secretary of telecommunications, SENATEL, requires that users register with the following information: full name, phone number, passport number, voting certificate number, email address, and home address.<ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/>\n\n[[Self-censorship]] of comments critical of the government is encouraged. In January 2013, for example, [[Rafael Correa|President Correa]] called for the National Secretary of Intelligence (SENAIN) to investigate two Twitter users who had published disparaging comments about him, an announcement which sent a warning to others not to post comments critical of the president. After receiving criticism from the government, news site [[La Hora]] indefinitely suspended the reader comments section on its website. At the president's request, the comments section was shut down completely. Print and digital news outlet [[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]] faced similar pressure related to its readers\u2019 comments and the comments section was ultimately disabled after President Correa sent a letter of complaint. While there are no official constraints on organizing protests over the Internet, warnings from the president stating that the act of protesting will be interpreted as \"an attempt to destabilize the government\" have undoubtedly discouraged some from organizing and participating in protests.<ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/>\n\nEcuador's new \"Organic Law on Communications\" was passed in June 2013. The law recognizes a right to communication.  Media companies are required to collect and store user information. \u201cMedia lynching\u201d, which appears to extend to any accusation of corruption or investigation of a public official\u2014even those that are supported with evidence, is prohibited. Websites bear \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d for all content they host, including content authored by third parties. The law creates a new media regulator to prohibit the dissemination of \u201cunbalanced\u201d information and bans non-degreed journalists from publishing, effectively outlawing much investigative reporting and citizen journalism. Human rights organizations fear that the new law will stifle critical voices in the media, due to its vague wording, arbitrary sanctions, and the threat of civil and criminal penalties.<ref name=FOTN-Ecuador-2013/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ETAPA]]\n* [[Gal\u00e1pagos (radio show)]]\n* [[HCJB]], \"The Voice of the Andes\" radio station\n\n==References==\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ecuadorian mobile phone companies}}\n{{South America topic|Telecommunications in}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Ecuador topics}}\n{{Internet censorship by country}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Communications in Ecuador| ]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in Ecuador| ]]\n[[Category:Internet censorship by country|Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in South America|Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Internet in Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Internet by country|Ecuador]]", "sha1": "skd48ncd912szbhjx16ly854nce2e58"}}, {"title": "Transport in Ecuador", "ns": "0", "id": "9341", "revision": {"id": "849316005", "parentid": "845646049", "timestamp": "2018-07-08T04:25:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{lead rewrite|date=February 2013}}\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''Transportation in [[Ecuador]]''' uses six transportation methods to transport passengers and freight (more specifically, [[petroleum oil|oil]]).

(in Spanish)]]\n\n[[Ecuador]]'s [[military]] history dates far back to its first attempt to secure freedom from [[Spain]] in 1811. In 1822 Ecuadorian troops, alongside other rebel forces, scored a [[decisive victory]] over the [[Spain|Spanish]] royalist [[army]] at the [[Battle of Pichincha]]. Although assisted by Peruvian troops, it would fight these only a few years later in 1828, as a member of the Confederation of [[Gran Colombia]]. Confederation forces, fewer than half of which were [[Ecuadorians]],{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} defeated a much larger Peruvian force near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], at the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. Eventually, Civil War would plunge the country and the army into disorder. In 1941 the Ecuadorian Military found itself weak and disorganized; the by now long-lasting territorial dispute with [[Peru]] escalated into a major conflict, the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War|Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War of 1941]]. A much larger and better equipped Peruvian force quickly overwhelmed the Ecuadorian forces, driving them back and invading the Ecuadorian territory. Ecuador had no choice but to accept Peru's territorial claims and signed [[Rio Protocol|Peace treaty]] in 1942. However, the treaty of 1942 failed to settle the border dispute and occasional clashes occurred in a then still non-demarcated border area between the nations. These clashes flared into another outbreak of serious fighting in January 1981 called the [[Paquisha War]]; similar incidents occurred in 1983 and again in 1984. The last [[military]] conflict with Peru occurred in 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]], in which both sides claimed to be fighting inside their own territory until the signing of a ceasefire and the eventual separation of forces. The longest-running source of armed international conflict in the Western Hemisphere had ended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguy.com/hgnews_ecuador-peru.html |title=News:Ecuador-Peru |publisher=The History Guy |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Local engagements===\n*[[Ecuadorian War of Independence]] in 1820\n*[[Battle of Pichincha]] in 1822\n*[[Gran Colombia\u2013Peru War]] in 1829\n*[[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian war of 1858|Ecuadorian-Peruvian war]] of 1858\n*[[Battle of Guayaquil]] in 1860\n*[[Ecuadorian-Colombian War]] in 1863\n*[[Chincha Islands War]] in 1864\n*[[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] in 1941\n*[[Paquisha War]] in 1981\n*[[Cenepa War]], in 1995\n\n===UN peacekeeping operations ===\nThe Ecuadorian Armed Forces has provided [[United Nations Military Observer|Military Observer]]s and troops to the [[United Nations]] since 1948.

Only in the 1980s did it begin to develop a modest domestic arms industry as the Directorate of Army Industries manufactured rifle ammunition, uniforms, boots, and other consumable items.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, [[France]] became a leading supplier and delivered [[AMX-13]] tanks and various aircraft. [[Ecuador]] purchased also [[Type 209 submarine]]s and [[L\u00fcrssen]]-Seawolf TNC 45 patrol boats from [[West Germany]]. Whereas various types of [[Infantry]] weapons were acquired from [[Belgium]].\n\n[[Ecuador]] became a substantial customer for [[Israel]]i arms in the 1970s, purchasing [[IAI Arava|Arava aircraft]], [[Gabriel missile]] for naval patrol crafts and [[Uzi]] submachine guns. Under technical assistance contracts, [[Israel]] serviced [[Israel]]i planes within the [[Ecuadorian Air Force|air force]] inventory as well as [[Boeing]] civilian aircraft flown by [[TAME]] and ''Ecuatoriana Airlines''. [[Ecuador]] reportedly also employed [[Israel]]i security specialists as consultants in the fight against terrorism. In 1976 [[Ecuador]] became the first foreign country to order the [[Kfir]], an advanced jet-fighter equipped with the General Electric J-79 engine produced in [[Israel]] under license. The transaction, which required [[United States]] government approval because of the engine technology, was rejected by the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in order to discourage the proliferation of sophisticated military equipment in the [[Third World]]. The action caused an uproar in [[Israel]] where the sale was regarded as an important breakthrough in [[Israel]]s efforts to develop international markets for the [[Kfir]]. In 1981, after the inauguration of President [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] removed its objection to the sale. Although the contract called for the purchase of 12 [[Kfir]]s and an option to purchase an additional 12, [[Ecuador]] acquired only the original group, at a price estimated at US$196 million.\n\n[[Ecuador]] became a relatively heavy importer of arms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, averaging US$150 million annually and reaching a peak of US$280 million in 1982. These imports declined sharply to an average of only US$50 million annually between 1985 and 1987, presumably as a result of a dramatic reduction in oil revenues and the precipitous drop in the value of the [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]], which made imported arms extremely expensive. Between 1983 and 1987, [[Ecuador]] imported an estimated US$460 million of arms, primarily from [[Italy]], [[France]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1995, during the [[Cenepa War]] against [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] gave to [[Ecuador]] in a controversial move, 6.500 [[ton]]s of rifles, cannons, [[anti-tank rockets]], and ammunition.<ref>{{cite news|author=Redacci\u00f3n BBC Mundo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7274000/7274638.stm |title=BBC Mundo &#124; Am\u00e9rica Latina &#124; As\u00ed fue la \u00faltima guerra |publisher=BBC News |date= 3 March 2008|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nRecent times saw changes within [[Ecuador]]s foreign policy and it decided to look for alternative weapon suppliers.

[[Israel]], delivered in 2009 its [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] and [[Brazil]], supplied additional military vehicles and [[Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano|Super Tucano]] combat-aircraft. Countries like [[Russia]] and [[China]] had already delivered a small quantity of military equipment some years earlier, but gained on importance during the past few years. Since then, Chinese radars, anti-aircraft systems and infantry weapons were purchased. In 2009 two additional [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters have been ordered from [[Russia]] with further deals planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=108411&sectionid=351020706 |title=Ecuador seeks arms deal with Russia |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930001123/https://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=108411&sectionid=351020706 |archivedate=30 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[India]] delivered [[HAL Dhruv]] helicopters and [[South Africa]] is about to deliver 12 [[Atlas Cheetah]] [[supersonic]]-aircraft.

Egypt borders [[Libya]] to the west, Israel to the northeast, the [[Gaza Strip]] which is part of[[State of Palestine| Palestine]] to the northeast, and [[Sudan]] to the [[south]]. Egypt has an area of 1,001,449&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (386,662&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>).\n\nThe longest straight-line distance in Egypt from north to south is 1,024&nbsp;km (636&nbsp;mi), while that from east to west measures 1,240&nbsp;km (771&nbsp;mi). More than 2,900&nbsp;km (1800&nbsp;mi) of coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]].\n\n==Governorates==\n{{Main|Governorates of Egypt}}\nEgypt is divided into 27 [[governorate]]s, which include two city-governorates: [[Alexandria]] ([[Alexandria Governorate]]) and [[Cairo]] ([[Cairo Governorate]]). There are nine governorates of [[Lower Egypt]] in the [[Nile Delta]] region, ten of [[Upper Egypt]] along the [[Nile]] river south from Cairo to [[Aswan]] and five frontier governorates covering Sinai and the deserts that lie west and east of the Nile river.\n\n==Natural regions==\n[[File:Egypt Topography.png|thumb|250px|Egypt's topography.]]\nEgypt is predominantly [[desert]]. 35,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> - 3.5% - of the total land area is [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d and permanently settled. Most of the country lies within the wide band of desert that stretches eastwards from Africa's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] across the [[continent]] and into southwest Asia.\n\nEgypt's [[geological]] history has produced four major [[physical regions]]:\n* [[Nile]] Valley and [[Nile Delta]]\n* [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] (from the Nile west to the Libyan border) \n* [[Eastern Desert]] (extends from the Nile Valley all the way to the [[Red Sea]] coast)\n* [[Sinai Peninsula]]\n\nDespite covering only about 5% of the total area of Egypt; the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Nile Delta]] are the most important regions, being the country's only cultivable regions and supporting about 99% of the population.  The Nile valley extends approximately 800&nbsp;km from Aswan to the outskirts of Cairo.  The Nile Valley is very cool and known as [[Upper Egypt]], while the Nile Delta region is known as [[Lower Egypt]].  Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of the Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production.  In the past, flooding of the Nile during the summer provided silt and water to make agriculture possible on land that is otherwise very dry.  Since construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], agriculture in the Nile valley depends on [[irrigation]].  The Nile delta consists of flat, low-lying areas.  Some parts of the delta are marshy and water-logged, and thus not suitable for agriculture.  Other areas of the delta are used for agriculture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pyramid Builders of Ancient Egypt: A Modern Investigation of Pharaoh's Workforce |author=Rosalie, David |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |chapter=The Geography and Historical Background |pages=14}}</ref>\n\n===Nile Valley and Delta===\n[[File:Nile composite NASA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nile delta, and the entire course of the Nile]]\n{{Main|Nile|Nile Delta}}\nThe Nile Valley and Delta, the most extensive [[oasis]] on earth, was created by the world's longest river and its seemingly inexhaustible sources. Without the [[topographic]] [[Stream channel|channel]] that permits the Nile to flow across the [[Sahara]], Egypt would be entirely desert. The length within Egypt of the River Nile in its northwards course from three central African sources \u2013 the [[White Nile]], the [[Blue Nile]], and the [[Atbara]] \u2013 totals some 1,600&nbsp;km.\n\nThe White Nile, which begins at [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Uganda]], supplies about 28% of the Nile's Egyptian waters. In its course from Lake Victoria to [[Juba]] in [[South Sudan]], the White Nile's channel drops more than 600 m. In its 1,600-km course from Juba to [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]]'s capital, the river descends just 75 m. In South Sudan, the White Nile passes through the [[Sudd]], a wide, flat plain covered with [[swamp]] [[vegetation]] and slows almost to the point of [[Water stagnation|stagnation]].\n\nThe Blue Nile, which originates at [[Lake Tana]] in [[Ethiopia]], provides on average some 58% of the Nile's Egyptian waters. This river has a steeper gradient and therefore  flows more swiftly than the White Nile, which it joins at Khartoum. Unlike the White Nile, the Blue Nile carries a considerable amount of [[sediment]]. For several kilometres north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly [[mud]]dy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer.\n\nThe much shorter Atbarah River, which also originates in Ethiopia, joins the main Nile north of Khartoum between the fifth and sixth [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataracts]] (areas of steep rapids) and provides about 14% of the Nile's waters in Egypt. During the low-water season, which runs from January to June, the Atbarah shrinks to a number of pools. But, in late-summer, when torrential rains fall on the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the Atbarah provides 22% of the Nile's flow.\n\nThe Blue Nile has a similar pattern. It contributes 17% of the Nile's waters in the low-water season and 68% during the high-water season. In contrast, the White Nile provides only 10% of the Nile's waters during the high-water season but contributes more than 80% during the low-water period. Thus, before the [[Aswan High Dam]] was completed in 1971, the White Nile watered the Egyptian stretch of the river throughout the year, whereas the Blue Nile, carrying seasonal rain from Ethiopia, caused the Nile to overflow its banks and deposit a layer of fertile mud over adjacent fields. The great flood of the main Nile usually occurred in Egypt during August, September, and October, but it sometimes began as early as June at [[Aswan]] and often did not completely wane until January.\n\nThe Nile enters Egypt a few kilometers north of [[Wadi Halfa]], a Sudanese town that was completely rebuilt on high ground when its original site was submerged in the [[reservoir]] created by the Aswan High Dam. As a result of the dam's construction, the Nile actually begins its flow into Egypt as [[Lake Nasser]], which extends southwards from the dam for 320&nbsp;km to the border and for an additional 158&nbsp;km within Sudan. Lake Nasser's waters fill the area through [[Lower Nubia]] (Upper Egypt and northern Sudan) within the narrow [[canyon]] between the [[cliffs]] of [[sandstone]] and [[granite]] created by the flow of the river over many centuries.\n\nBelow Aswan the cultivated [[floodplain]] strip widens to as much as twenty km. North of Isna (160&nbsp;km north of Aswan), the plateau on both sides of the valley rises to as much as 550 m above sea level; at Qina (some 90&nbsp;km north of Isna) the 300-m limestone cliffs force the Nile to change course towards the southwest for about 60&nbsp;km before it turns northwest for about 160&nbsp;km to Asyut. Northward from Asyut, the [[escarpment]]s on both sides diminish, and the valley widens to a maximum of 22&nbsp;km.\n\nAt Cairo, the Nile spreads out over what was once a broad [[estuary]], subsequently filled by silt deposits to form what is now a fertile, fan-shaped [[River delta|delta]] some 250&nbsp;km wide at its seaward extremity and extending about 160&nbsp;km from north to south. The Nile Delta covers approximately 22,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (roughly equivalent in area to that of [[Massachusetts]]). According to historical accounts from the first century AD, seven branches of the Nile once ran through the delta. According to later accounts, the Nile had, by around the twelfth century, just six branches.\n\nSince then, nature and man have closed all but two main outlets: the east branch, [[Damietta]] (also seen as Dumyat; 240&nbsp;km long), and the west branch, [[Rosetta]] (235&nbsp;km long). Both outlets are named after the [[port]]s located at their respective mouths. A network of [[drainage]] and [[irrigation]] [[canals]] supplements these remaining outlets. In the north, near the coast, the Nile delta embraces a series of [[salt marshes]] and [[lake]]s, the most notable among which are [[Idku]], [[Al Burullus]], and [[Manzilah]].\n\nThe fertility and productivity of the land adjacent to the Nile depends largely on the [[silt]] deposited by floodwaters. [[Archaeological]] research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. The timing and the amount of annual flow were always unpredictable. Measurements of annual flows as low as 1.2 billion m<sup>3</sup> and as high as 4.25 billion m<sup>3</sup> have been recorded. For centuries Egyptians attempted to predict and take advantage of these flows and thereby moderate the severity of floods.\n\nThe construction of [[dams]] on the Nile, particularly the Aswan High Dam, transformed the mighty river into a large and predictable [[irrigation]] [[ditch]]. Lake Nasser, the world's largest artificial lake, has enabled planned use of the Nile regardless of the amount of rainfall in [[Central Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's [[fertility]], which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the [[arable land]] but also on the materials left by the water.\n\nResearchers have estimated that beneficial silt deposits in the valley began about 10,000 years ago. The average annual deposit of arable soil through the course of the river valley amounted to some nine metres. Analysis of the flow revealed that 10.7 million tons of solid matter passed Cairo each year.\n\nToday the Aswan High Dam obstructs most of this sediment, now retained in Lake Nasser. The reduction in annual silt deposits has contributed to rising water tables and increasing [[soil salinity]] in the Delta, the erosion of the river's banks in [[Upper Egypt]], and the erosion of the [[alluvial fan]] along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n===Western Desert===\n{{Main|Western Desert (Egypt)}}\nThe Western Desert covers an area of some 700,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, thereby  accounting for around two-thirds of Egypt's total land area. This immense desert to the west of the Nile spans the area from the Mediterranean Sea southwards to the Sudanese border. The desert's [[Jilf al Kabir Plateau]], at a mean altitude of  some 1000 m, constitutes an exception to the uninterrupted territory of basement rocks covered by layers of horizontally bedded sediments forming a massive plain or low plateau. The [[Great Sand Sea]] lies within the desert's plain and extends from the [[Siwa Oasis]] to [[Jilf al Kabir]]. [[Escarpment]]s (ridges) and deep depressions (basins) exist in several parts of the Western Desert, and no rivers or streams drain into or out of the area.\n\nThe government has considered the Western Desert a frontier region and has divided it into two governorates at about the twenty-eighth parallel: [[Matruh Governorate|Matruh]] to the north and New Valley (Al Wadi al Jadid) to the south. There are seven important depressions in the Western Desert, and all are considered oases except the largest, [[Qattara]], the water of which is salty.  The [[Qattara Depression]], which includes the country's lowest point, encompasses {{convert|19605|km2|mi2|0|sp=us}}, which is similar to the size of [[Lake Ontario]].  It is largely below sea level and is {{convert|133|m|ft|0|sp=us}} below sea level at the lowest. [[Badlands]], salt marshes, and salt lakes cover the sparsely inhabited Qattara Depression.\n\nLimited [[agricultural]] production, the presence of some natural resources, and permanent [[Community|settlements]] are found in the other six depressions, all of which have fresh water provided by the Nile or by local [[groundwater]]. The Siwah Oasis, close to the Libyan border and west of Qattara, is isolated from the rest of Egypt but has sustained life since ancient times. The Siwa's cliff-hung Temple of Amun was renowned for its oracles for more than 1,000 years. [[Herodotus]] and [[Alexander the Great]] were among the many illustrious people who visited the temple in the pre-Christian era.\n\nThe other major [[oases]] form a [[topographic]] chain of [[Depression (geology)|basin]]s extending from the [[Faiyum Oasis]] (sometimes called the Fayyum Depression) which lies {{convert|60|km|mi|0|sp=us}} southwest of [[Cairo]], south to the [[Bahariya]], [[Farafra|Farafirah]], and [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhilah]] oases before reaching the country's largest oasis, [[Kharga|Kharijah]]. A brackish lake, [[Birket Qarun]], at the northern reaches of Al Fayyum Oasis, drained into the Nile in ancient times. For centuries sweet water [[artesian wells]] in the Fayyum Oasis have permitted extensive [[Tillage|cultivation]] in an irrigated area that extends over {{convert|1800|km2|mi2|0|sp=us}}.\n\n===Eastern Desert===\n[[File:Dust storms off Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A large plume of Saharan Desert dust (light brownish pixels) blown across Libya and Egypt northward over the Mediterranean Sea toward the Middle East, on February 2, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Eastern Desert}}\n\nThe topographic features of the desert region east of the Nile differ from those to the west of the Nile. The Eastern Desert is relatively mountainous. The elevation rises abruptly from the Nile, and a downward-sloping plateau of sand gives way within 100&nbsp;km to arid, defoliated, rocky hills running north and south between the Sudan border and the Delta. The hills reach elevations of more than 1,900 m.\n\nThe region's most prominent feature is the easterly chain of rugged mountains, the Red Sea Hills, which extend from the Nile Valley eastward to the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the Red Sea. This elevated region has a natural drainage pattern that rarely functions because of insufficient rainfall. It also has a complex of irregular, sharply cut [[wadis]] that extend westward toward the Nile. The desert environment extends all the way to the Red Sea coast.\n\n===Sinai Peninsula===\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Mount Catherine]] in [[Sinai]], Egypt's highest point.]]\nThe [[Sinai Peninsula]] is a triangular-shaped [[peninsula]], about 61,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area (slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]). Similar to the desert, the peninsula contains mountains in its southern sector that are a geological extension of the Red Sea Hills, the low range along the Red Sea coast that includes [[Mount Catherine]] (Jabal Katrinah), the country's highest point, at 2,642 m above sea-level. The Red Sea may have been named after these mountains, which are red.\n\nThe southern side of the peninsula has a sharp escarpment that subsides after a narrow coastal shelf that slopes into the Red Sea and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. The elevation of Sinai's southern rim is about 1,000 m. Moving northward, the elevation of this [[limestone]] plateau decreases. The northern third of Sinai is a flat, sandy coastal plain, which extends from the Suez Canal into the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]].\n\nBefore the Israeli military occupied Sinai during the June 1967 War (Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Six-Day War), a single Egyptian governorate administered the whole peninsula. By 1982 after all of Sinai was returned to Egypt, the central government divided the peninsula into two governorates. North Sinai has its capital at Al Arish and the South Sinai has its capital in Artt Turkishy.\n\nThe abundance of life in the Sinai Peninsula may not be immediately apparent. This again has its roots in the way in which the animals of the desert have adapted to life here. Many species, mammals especially, but also reptiles and even birds such as owls, are nocturnal. They spend the daylight hours in the relative cool of burrows, under boulders or in crevices and cracks in the rock. Many of these creatures will only be apparent from their tracks and trails or from a fleeting glimpse of a diminutive gerbil, or zig-zigging hare, in the car headlights at night. Even those animals that do brave the heat of the day are normally only active in the early morning or evening.\n\n==Urban and rural areas==\nIn the 1970 census, 57 percent of Egypt's population was counted as rural, including those residing in agricultural areas in the Nile Valley and Delta, as well as the much smaller number of persons living in desert areas.  Rural areas differ from the urban in terms of poverty, fertility rates, and other social factors.  Agriculture is a key component of the economy in rural areas, though some people are employed in the tourist industry or other non-farm occupations.  In 1992, the percentage of Egypt's population employed in agriculture was 33 percent.  The agricultural industry is dependent on [[irrigation]] from the Nile river.<ref>{{cite book |title=Directions of Change in Rural Egypt |author=Hopkins, Nicholas and Kirsten Westergaard |year=1998 |publisher=American University in Cairo |pages=2\u20134}}</ref>\n\n==Extreme points==\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Egypt]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point \u2013 unnamed headland immediately north-west of [[Sidi Barrani]], [[Matruh Governorate]]\n* Easternmost point \u2013 [[Ras Hadarba]] (Cape Elba), [[Red Sea Governorate]]*\n* Southernmost point - [[Jabal Bartazuga]] on the Sudanese border, [[Red Sea Governorate]] **\n* Westernmost point - unnamed point on the border with [[Libya]] immediately east of the ruin of [[Qasr al Qarn]] in Libya, [[Matruh Governorate]]\n* ''* Ras Hadarba lies within the [[Hala'ib triangle]] which is claimed by [[Sudan]] but occupied by Egypt.

These regions are among the world's most densely populated, containing an average of over 1,540 per km\u00b2, as compared to 96 persons per km\u00b2 for the country as a whole.\n\nSmall communities spread throughout the [[desert]] regions of Egypt are clustered around historic trade and transportation routes. The government has tried with mixed success to encourage migration to newly [[irrigation|irrigated]] land reclaimed from the desert. However, the proportion of the population living in rural areas has continued to decrease as people move to the megacities in search of employment and a higher [[standard of living]].\n\nAccording to the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] and other proponents of demographic structural approach ([[cliodynamics]]), the basic problem Egypt has an unemployment rate driven by a demographic [[youth bulge]]: with the number of new people entering the job force at about 4% a year, unemployment in Egypt is almost 10 times as high for [[college graduate]]s as it is for people who have gone through elementary school, particularly educated urban youth, who comprised most of the people that were seen out in the streets during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]]. An estimated 75% of Egyptians are under the age of 25 with just 3% over the age of 65, making it one of the most youthful populations in the world.<ref>[[Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J.

The 2030 high variant is 104.4 million, the medium - 101.7 million, the low - 99.8 million. However the information could be misleading as the 2013 population figure of 84.6 million is higher than the projected high of 83 million. In fact, due to an unexpected rise in the fertility rate (from 3.0 to 3.5), the population already surpassed 91 million on 5 June 2016 while reaching 92 million on 30 November, average population age remaining stable despite a rising life expectancy.\n\n==Vital statistics==\nVital statistics:<ref>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001] United nations.

companies, diplomats, etc.\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Egypt consists of [[Egyptians]] including [[Copts]], Egyptians make up 95% of the population.<ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The vast majority of Egyptians are native speakers of modern Egyptian Arabic.\n\nMinorities in Egypt include the [[Copts in Egypt|Copts]] who represent around 10% of the entire population and live all over the country, the [[Berbers in Egypt|Berber]]-speaking community of the [[Siwa Oasis]] (Siwis) and the [[Nubian people]] clustered along the Nile in the southernmost part of [[Egypt]]. There are also sizable minorities of [[Beja people|Beja]] and [[Romani people in Egypt|Dom]].\n\nThe country was host to many different communities during the colonial period, including [[Greeks in Egypt|Greeks]], [[Italians in Egypt|Italians]], [[Lebanese people in Egypt|Lebanese]], [[Syro-Lebanese in Egypt|Syro-Lebanese]], [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jews]], [[Armenians in Egypt|Armenians]], [[Turks in Egypt|Turks]] and [[Albanians in Egypt|Albanians]], though most either left or were compelled to leave after political developments in the 1950s. The country still hosts some 90,000 refugees and asylum seekers, mostly [[Palestinians in Egypt|Palestinians]] and [[Sudanese refugees in Egypt|Sudanese]].\n\nOther sources{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} give more detailed statistics, including the [[Beja people|Beja]] (ca. 1 million), the [[Nubians]] (ca. 300,000 in 1996), [[Romani people in Egypt|Dom]] (ca. 230,000 in 1996), [[Berbers in Egypt|Berbers]] (Siwis) (ca. 5,000).\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Languages of Egypt}}\n[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of Egypt, with the vast majority of Egyptians speaking [[Egyptian Arabic]]. In The Upper Nile valley, [[Sa'idi Arabic]] is prevalent. The [[Coptic language]] is used in the Coptic church for the majority of prayers, hymns, masses, and meditations. \n[[English language|English]] widely understood as well as [[French language|French]].\n[[Siwa language]] used in ethnic Berber tribal areas in the western desert (Siwa), and [[Nubian language]] is widely used among the ethnic Nubians in the southern areas.\n\n==Religions==\n{{main|Religion in Egypt|Islam in Egypt|Christianity in Egypt}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Egypt (est. 2017)<ref>[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2014&dlid=238452#wrapper International Religious Freedom Report for 2014] US Department of State</ref>\n|label1 = [[Islam in Egypt|Islam]]\n|value1 = 90 \n|color1 = MediumSeaGreen\n|label2 = [[Christianity in Egypt|Christianity]]\n|value2 = 10\n|color2 = Purple\n}}\nAccording to the [[CIA World Factbook]], approximately 90% of the population is Muslim and 10% is Christian (9% [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], 1% other Christian).

Education is free through university and compulsory from ages six through 15, though enforcement may be lax. Rates for primary and secondary education have strengthened in recent years. The vast majority of children enter primary school though a significant number drop out. There are approx. 200,000 primary and secondary schools with some 10 million students, 13 major universities with more than 500,000 students, and 67 teacher colleges. Major universities include [[Cairo University]] (100,000 students), Ain Shams University, [[Alexandria University]], the 1,000-year-old [[Al-Azhar University]], one of the world's major centers of Islamic learning and the AUC ([[American University in Cairo]]), . The former first lady has created many project towards the advancement of Egyptian education and the efforts to force education to the remaining 7-9% of students who drop out illegally. Child labor is a contributing factor to these dropouts but it is considered a serious crime to work children under the legal age and charges are taken very seriously at this time.\n\n==CIA World Factbook demographic statistics==\n[[File:Bev\u00f6lkerungspyramide \u00c4gypten 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid in 2016.

The President of Egypt is elected for two and four-year terms and the Parliament is unicameral. The President can appoint up to 5% of the total number of seats in Parliament, and can also dissolve it. Parliament can also impeach the President. Egypt was traditionally ruled by royals until 1952, but the first free elected President was in {{refnec|[[Egyptian presidential election, 2006|2006]]|date=October 2018}}. The [[Parliament of Egypt]] is the oldest legislative chamber in Africa and the Middle East.\n\n==Presidency==\n{{Main article|President of Egypt}}\n\nThe President is elected for a four-year term that can be renewed once. To run for presidency, candidates must provide 30,001 signatures from at least 15 provinces or provide signatures from 30 members of a chamber of the legislature, or run through nomination by a party holding at least one seat in the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/commission-announces-proposed-changes-egyptian-constitution|title=Commwission announces proposed changes to Egyptian Constitution|publisher=Egypt Independent|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe position was created after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1202]], Mohammed Naguib was the first to hold the position. Prior to 2005, the Parliament chose a candidate for the Presidency and the people voted, in a referendum, whether or not they approve the proposed candidate for President. In 2005, the first presidential elections were held, with multiple candidates standing for the position, however the elections was deemed neither fair nor free.

The President can dissolve the Parliament, declare state of emergency and declare wars, but the Parliament must approve any law first. The Parliament can impeach the President after two-thirds votes in favour for impeachment, and then a public referendum is held to whether or not approve the impeachment of the President.\n\n==Legislative Branch==\n{{Life in Egypt}}\n{{main article|History of Parliamentary life in Egypt}}\n[[Parliament of Egypt|Parliament]] meets for one eight-month session each year; under special circumstances the President of the Republic can call an additional session.

The Constitution reserves fifty percent of the House may force the resignation of the executive cabinet by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]] and his cabinet are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and house from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]].\n\nThe most recent elections held in [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015|2015]].\n\n===The Consultative Council (Maglis El-Shura)===\nThe [[Shura Council (Egypt)|Shura Council]] was the 264-member upper house of Parliament created in 1980. In the Shura Council 176 members were directly elected and 88 members were appointed by the President of the Republic for six-year terms. One half of the Shura Council was renewed every three years.\n\nThe Shura Council's legislative powers were limited.

However the elected Parliament was dissolved by the constitutional court and new elections were held in [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2015|2015]]\n\nBelow the national level, authority is exercised by and through governors and mayors appointed by the central government and by popularly elected local councils.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Main article|List of political parties in Egypt|Elections in Egypt}}\nAccording to the [[Constitution of Egypt|Egyptian Constitution]], political parties are allowed to exist. Religious political parties are not allowed as it would not respect the [[separation of church and state|principle of non-interference of religion in politics]] and that religion has to remain in the private sphere to respect all beliefs. Also forbidden are political parties supporting militia formations or having an agenda that is contradictory to the constitution and its principles, or threatening the country's stability such as national unity between Muslim Egyptians and [[Copts|Christian Egyptians]].\n\nAs of 2015, there are more than 100 registered political parties in Egypt.

These laws sharply circumscribed any non-governmental political activity: street demonstrations, non-approved political organizations, and un-registered financial donations were formally banned. Nonetheless, since 2000, these restrictions have been violated in practice. In 2003, the agenda shifted heavily towards local democratic reforms, opposition to the succession of [[Gamal Mubarak]] as president, and rejection of violence by state security forces. Groups involved in the latest wave include PCSPI, the Egyptian Movement for Change ([[Kefaya]]), and the Association for Egyptian Mothers.\n\nSubstantial peasant activism exists on a variety of issues, especially related to [[land rights]] and [[land reform]]. A major flash point was the 1997 repeal of [[Egyptian land reform|Nasser-era land reform policies]] under pressure for [[structural adjustment]]. A pole for this activity is the Land Center for Human Rights.\n\nThe [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], inspired by the recent revolution in [[Tunisia]], forced the resignation of President Mubarak and the Military Junta that succeeded him abrogated the Constitution and promised free and fair elections under a new one.\n\nOn August 15, 2015 President al-Sisi enacted a new Counter Terrorism Law, which [[Human Rights Watch]] claims \"mimics\" language \"already contained in Egypt\u2019s decades-old Emergency Law\". The new law gives the president, in article 53, power to take `appropriate measures to protect the general order and security` to confront the danger of terrorism or in case of an environmental catastrophe. This includes \"the power to order six-month curfews or evacuations in defined areas, subject to a majority vote in parliament within seven days, or cabinet approval if parliament is not in session.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Egypt: Counterterrorism Law Erodes Basic Rights  |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/08/19/egypt-counterterrorism-law-erodes-basic-rights| date=August 19, 2015  |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Political pressure groups and leaders==\nBefore the revolution, Mubarak tolerated limited political activity by the Brotherhood for his first two terms, but then moved more aggressively  to block its influence (arguably leading to its recent rise in public support). Trade unions and professional associations are officially sanctioned. In 2014, in Upper Egypt, several newspapers reported that the region of Upper Egypt wants to secede from Egypt to try to improve living standards.<ref name=\"Is Egypt Breaking Apart?\">{{cite web | url=http://www.iar-gwu.org/content/egypt-breaking-apart | title=Is Egypt Breaking Apart? | publisher=International Affairs Review | date=17 February 2014 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=Gratowski,   J.

The Secretary General of the League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abu El Ghet is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. The Arab League moved out of Egypt to Tunis in 1978 as a protest at the peace treaty with Israel, but returned in 1989.\n\nEgypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, after the signing of the [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] at the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]]. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab nations, and in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian dispute. Most Arab nations still give credence to Egypt playing that role, though its effects are often limited.\n\nFormer Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.\n\nA territorial dispute with Sudan over an area known as the [[Hala'ib Triangle]], has meant that diplomatic relations between the two remain strained.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Hatem Elliesie: [http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/download/attachments/17138089/Elliesie+Egypt.pdf ''The Rule of Law in Egypt''].

In the 1990s, a series of [[International Monetary Fund]] arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in the [[Gulf War]] coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance.\n\nSince 2000, the pace of structural reforms, including fiscal, monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislations, helped Egypt move towards a more [[Market economy|market-oriented economy]] and prompted increased foreign investment. The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results which averaged 8% annually between 2004 and 2009 but the government largely failed to equitably share the wealth and the benefits of growth have failed to trickle down to improve economic conditions for the broader population, especially with the growing problem of unemployment and underemployment.\n\n==Macroeconomic trend==\nEgypt has a rather stable [[mixed economy]] enjoying average growth, averaging 3%\u20135% in the past quarter-century. The economy embarked on various stages of development during which the public and private sectors played roles varying in relative importance as follows:\n\n* '''Import Substitution and Nationalization''' (1952\u20131966): during which the first programme of industrialization in 1957 was established and led by the public sector in heavy industries such as iron and steel, chemical industries, and [[heavy machinery]]. Nationalization reduced the relative importance of the private sector. There was no stock trading to speak of, all banks and financial institutions were under the public sector, and foreign direct investment was almost banned.\n*'''Inter-War''' (1967\u20131973): adversely affected the performance of the economy and public sector role in import substitution.\n*'''Openness Euphoria''' (1974\u20131985): during which policies were introduced to encourage Arab and foreign investment through a series of incentives and liberalizing trade and payment; heavy emphasis was put on developing the [[tourism]] and [[Textile industry|textile manufacturing industry]] as drivers of growth, the economy expanded but this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled Back.\n*'''External Debt Crisis''' (1985\u20131990): the external debt crisis and [[Paris Club]] rescheduling and debt reduction.\n*'''Economic Reform''' (1991\u20132007): reform policies were introduced to meet the terms of international institutions, lenders and donors, including wider incentives to the role of the private sector in all economic activities.\n*'''The Post Global Financial Crisis''' (2008-2011): soaring food prices, especially for grains, led to calls for the government to provide more immediate assistance to the population of more than 40% in the \"poverty tunnel\" and to strike a \"new deal\" on agriculture policy and reform. Egypt faced the long term supply- and demand-side repercussions of the global financial crisis on the national economy. \n* '''[[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Post-Revolution]]''' (2012\u20132016): the Egyptian economy suffered from a severe downturn following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|2011 revolution]] and the government faced numerous challenges to restore growth, market and investor confidence.<ref name=\"WBApr13\">[http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/egypt/overview Egypt Overview] worldbank.org, April 2013</ref> Egypt's foreign exchange reserves fell from $36 billion in December 2010 to only $16.3 billion in January 2012 as a result of propping up the [[Egyptian pound]] against the dollar.

[[Manufacturing]] had become less dominated by the [[public sector]], especially in heavy industries. A process of public sector reform and privatization has begun to enhance opportunities for the [[private sector]].\n\n[[Agriculture]], mainly in private hands, has been largely deregulated, with the exception of cotton and sugar production. Construction, non-financial services, and domestic wholesale and retail trades are largely private. This has promoted a steady increase of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] and the annual [[Economic growth|growth rate]]. The Government of Egypt tamed inflation bringing it down from double-digit to a single digit. Currently, GDP is rising smartly by 7% per annum due to successful diversification.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) increased fourfold between 1981 and 2006, from US$1355 in 1981, to US$2525 in 1991, to US$3686 in 2001 and to an estimated US$4535 in 2006. Based on national currency, GDP per capita at constant 1999 prices increased from EGP 411 in 1981, to EGP 2098 in 1991, to EGP 5493 in 2001 and to EGP 8708 in 2006.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Data from the Egypt's statistics body, CAPMAS.</ref>\n\nBased on the current US$ prices, GDP per capita increased from US$587 in 1981, to US$869 in 1991, to US$1461 in 2001 and to an estimated US$1518 (which translates to less than US$130 per month) in 2006. According to the [[World Bank]] Country Classification, Egypt has been promoted from the low income category to lower middle income category. As of 2013, the average weekly salaries in Egypt reached LE641 (approx. $92), which grew by 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n|'''Indicator'''<ref>Source: [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 IMF WEO Online database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611172746/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 |date=11 June 2010 }}</ref> ||'''1981''' ||'''1991''' ||'''2001''' ||'''2005''' ||'''2006'''\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| GDP (PPP) per capita, (US$) ||1,354.81 ||2,524.99 ||3,685.98 ||4,316.59 ||4,534.82\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| GDP per capita at constant prices, (EGP) ||3,121.85 ||4,075.47 ||5,138.36 ||5,519.09 ||5,692.24\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| GDP per capita at current prices,  (EGP) ||411.20 ||2,098.71 ||5,493.28 ||7,890.65 ||8,707.88\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\"| GDP per capita at current prices, (US$) ||587.42 ||869.30 ||1,460.98 ||1,315.75 ||1,517.85\n|}\n\nThe reform programme is a work in progress. Noteworthy that the reform record has substantially improved since Nazif government came to power. Egypt has made substantial progress in developing its legal, tax and investment infrastructure. (See Nawar 2006) Indeed, over the past five years, Egypt has passed, amended and admitted over 15 legislative pieces. The economy is expected to grow by about 4% to 6% in 2009/2010.\n\nSurging domestic inflationary pressures from both economic growth and elevated international food prices led the [[Central Bank of Egypt]] to increase the overnight lending and deposit rates in sequential moves since February 2008. The rates stood at 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively, since 18 September 2008.\n\nThe rise of the [[2008\u20132012 global recession|World Global Financial Crisis]] led to a set of fiscal-monetary policy measures to face its repercussions on the national economy, including reducing the overnight lending and deposit rates by 1% on 12 February 2009. The rates currently stand at 10.5% and 12.5%, respectively.<ref>Central Bank of Egypt, MPC Press Releases</ref>\n\nReform of energy and food subsidies, privatization of the state-owned [[Banque du Caire|Bank of Cairo]], and [[inflation targeting]] are perhaps the most controversial economic issues in 2007/2008 and 2008/2009.\n\n===External trade and remittances===\n[[File:2014 Egypt Products Export Treemap.png|thumb|350px|Egypt Export Treemap by Product (2014) from [http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/egy/all/show/2014/ Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity].]]\n\n[[File:2006Egyptian exports.PNG|thumb|350px|Egyptian export destinations in 2006.]]\nEgypt's trade balance marked US$10.36 billion in FY2005 compared to US$7.5 billion.\nEgypt's main exports consist of natural gas, and non-petroleum products such as ready-made clothes, cotton textiles, medical and petrochemical products, citrus fruits, rice and dried onion, and more recently cement, steel, and ceramics.\n\nEgypt's main imports consist of pharmaceuticals and non-petroleum products such as wheat, maize, cars and car spare parts. The current account grew from 0.7% of GDP in FY2002 to 3.3% at FY2005. Egypt's Current Account made a surplus of US$4478 million in FY2005 compared to a deficit of US$158 million in FY2004.\nItaly and the USA are the top export markets for Egyptian goods and services. In the [[Arab world]], Egypt has the largest non-oil GDP as of 2018.\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], an estimated 2.7 million Egyptians abroad contribute actively to the development of their country through [[remittance]] inflows, circulation of human and social capital, as well as investment. In 2009 [[Egypt]] was the biggest recipient of remittances in the [[Middle East]]; an estimated US$7.8 bn was received in 2009, representing approximately 5% of national GDP, with a decline of 10% from 2008, due mostly to the effect of the financial crisis. According to data from Egypt's Central Bank, the United States was the top sending country of remittances (23%), followed by [[Kuwait]] (15%), the [[United Arab Emirates]] (14%) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (9%).<ref name=\"egypt.iom.int\">{{cite web|url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf|title=Migration and Development in Egypt|publisher=International Organization for Migration Cairo|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Public finances===\nOn the revenues side, total revenues of the government were EGP 89.1 billion in FY2002 and are projected to reach EGP184.7 bn in FY2008. Much of the increase came from a rise in customs, excise and tax revenues, particularly personal income and sales, entertainment, and vice taxes which constituted the bulk of total domestic taxes, due to recent tax reforms. This trend is likely to gradually widen the tax base in the forthcoming years. Revenues, however, have remained more or less constant (about 21% ) as a percentage of the GDP over the past few years.\n\nOn the expenditures side, strong expenditure growth has remained a main feature of the budget. This is mainly a result of continued strong expansion of (1) the public-sector wages driven by government pledges. Wages and Compensations increased from EGP30.5 bn in FY2002 to EGP59.6 bn in FY2008; (2) high interest payments on the public debt stock. Interest payments rose from EGP21.8 bn in FY2002 to EGP52.0 bn in FY2008. Importantly, dramatic increase in domestic debt which is projected to be roughly 62% of GDP in FY2008 up from 58.4% in FY2002; and (3) the costs of food and energy subsidies, which rose from EGP18.0 bn in FY2002 to EGP64.5 bn in FY2008.\n\nThe overall deficit, after adjusting for net acquisition of financial assets, remains almost unchanged from the cash deficit. The budget's overall deficit of EGP 43.8 bn or -10.2% of GDP for FY2002 has become 49.2 bn in FY2007, so that is narrowed to \u22126.7% of GDP. Deficit is financed largely by domestic borrowing and revenue from [[divestment]] sales, which became a standard accounting practice in budget Egypt. The government aims at more sales of State assets in FY2008.\n\nRecently, the fiscal conduct of the government was under strong criticism and heated debate and discussions in the Egyptian Parliament.The reference was made to weak governance and management, loose implementation of tax collection procedures and penalties for offenders, and improper accounting of the overall system of basic subsidies and domestic debt, leading to domestic market disruptions, high inflation, increased inefficiencies and waste in the domestic economy.<ref>These remarks on fiscal conduct and corruption were made in a recent report presented by the head of the Central Agency of Auditing, Gawdat El-Malat, and discussed by the Egyptian Parliament on 14\u201315 January 2008.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Egypt's Summary of Budget Financing 2002\u20132015 <br> (Million of Egyptian Pounds and Fiscal years)\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\" \n!

In other words, had there been peace since 1991, an average Egyptian citizen would be earning over $3000 instead of $1700 he or she may earn next year.\n\n===The financial sector===\n\nThe [[Central Bank of Egypt]] is the national reserve bank and controls and regulates the financial market and the [[Egyptian pound]]. There is a State regulatory authority for the [[Cairo Stock Exchange]]. State-owned or Nationalized banks still account for 85% of bank accounts in Egypt and around 60% of the total savings. The penetration of banking is low in rural areas at only 57% of households.\n\n====Monetary policy====\nUp until 2007, there have been several favorable conditions that allowed the [[Central Bank of Egypt]] to accumulate net international reserves, which increased from US$20 billion in FY2005, to US$23 billion in FY2006, and to US$30 billion FY2007 contributing to growth in both reserve money and in broad money (M2). This declined to US$16.4 billion in Oct 2015, according to the Central Bank of Egypt.\n\nCredit extended to the private sector in Egypt declined significantly reaching about EGP 5 billion in FY2005. This [[credit crunch]] is due to the [[non-performing loan]]s extended by the banks to business tycoons and top government officials.\n\nLending criteria have been tightened following the passing of Money Laundry Law 80 in 2002 and Banking Law 88 in 2003. Interest rates are no longer the dominant factor in banks' lending decisions. In fact, both the inefficiency and absence of the role of the [[Central Bank of Egypt]] in qualitative and quantitative control as well as implementing banking procedures and standards was almost entirely responsible for the non-performing loans crisis. Banks steadily reduced credit from its peak of about EGP 30 billion in FY1999 and alternatively invested in more liquid no-risk securities such as treasury bills and government bonds. Improving private sector access to credit will critically depend on resolving the problem of non-performing loans with businesses and top government officials.\n\nThe era of [[inflation targeting]]\u2014i.e. maintaining inflation within a band\u2014has perhaps begun in Egypt more recently. Country experiences show that inflation targeting is a best-practice strategy for monetary policy. While the monetary policy appears more responsive to inflationary pressures recently in Egypt, it is noted that there is no [[core inflation]] measure and the Central Bank of Egypt takes targeting decisions based on the inflation rate released by the [[CAPMAS]] [[consumer price index]] off-the-shelf.<ref>Nawar, Abdel-Hameed (2008) \"PPI and Measuring Inflation in Business Transactions in Egypt\", Cairo University, manuscript, March. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=</ref>\n\n[[File:EGP 100 Pounds 2009 (Front).jpg|thumb|225px|100 EGP Obverse]]\nSurging domestic inflationary pressures from both economic growth and elevated international food prices led the [[Central Bank of Egypt]] ([[Central Bank of Egypt|CBE]]) to increase the overnight lending and deposit rates in sequential moves since 2008: it was raised by 0.25% on 10 February 2008, by 0.5% on 25 March 2008, by 0.5% on 8 May 2008, by 0.5% on 26 June 2008, by 0.5% on 7 August 2008 and most recently on 18 September 2008 for the sixth time in a year by 0.5% when it stood at 11.5% and 13.5%, respectively.\n\nThe rise of the World Global Financial Crisis led to a set of fiscal-monetary policy measures to face its repercussions on the national economy, including reducing the overnight lending and deposit rates by 1% on 12 February 2009. The rates currently stand at 10.5% and 12.5%, respectively. The [[Central Bank of Egypt|CBE]] is expected to further cut on interest rates over 2009, with seemingly little fear on Egyptian Pound depreciation resulting from decreased interest rates.\n\n====Exchange rate policy====\n[[File:Egypt Exchange Rate 06.JPG|thumb|450px|The exchange rate of the US dollar to the [[Egyptian pound]].]] \nThe exchange rate has been linked to the US dollar since the 1950s. Several regimes were adopted including initially the conventional peg in the sixties, regular crawling peg in the seventies and the eighties and crawling bands in the nineties. Over that time period, there were several exchange rate markets including black market, parallel market and the official market. With the turn of the new millennium, Egypt introduced a managed float regime and successfully unified the Pound exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis foreign currencies.\n\nThe transition to the unified exchange rate regime was completed in December 2004. Shortly later, Egypt has notified the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement, with effect from 2 January 2005. IMF members accepting the obligations of Article VIII undertake to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, or from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practices, except with IMF approval.\n\nBy accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Egypt gives assurance to the international community that it will pursue economic policies that will not impose restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions unnecessary, and will contribute to a multilateral payments system free of restrictions.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2004 and over most of the fiscal year 2005, the pound depreciated against the US dollar. Since the second half of the fiscal year 2006 until the end of the fiscal year 2007, the pound gradually appreciated to EGP 5.69 per USD. While it was likely to continue appreciating in the short-term, given the skyrocketing oil prices and the weakening US economy, the advent of the global [[Great Recession|economic crisis of 2008]], and resulting behavior of foreign investors exiting from the stock market in Egypt increased the dollar exchange rate against the Egyptian pound, which rose by more than 4% since [[Lehman Brothers]] declared [[bankruptcy]]. As the demand pressure from exiting foreign investors eases, the dollar exchange rate against the Egyptian pound is expected to decline. It stands at EGP 7.00 per USD as of 18 June 2013. Due to the rising power of the US dollar, as of January 2015 one dollar equals 7.83 Egyptian pounds.\n\nOn 3 November 2016, the Egyptian government announced that it would float the Egyptian pound in an effort to revive its economy, which had been suffering since 2011.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/egypt-free-floats-pound-raises-lending-rates-to-spur-economy</ref>\n\n==Natural resources==\n\n===Land, agriculture and crops===\n[[File:Flowers Harvest.jpg|thumb|Flower production.]]\nWarm weather and plentiful water have in the past produced several crops a year. However, since 2009 increasing [[desertification]] has become a problem. \"Egypt loses an estimated 11,736 hectares of agricultural land every year, making the nation's 3.1 million hectares of agricultural land prone \"to total destruction in the foreseeable future\", said Abdel Rahman Attia, a professor of agriculture at Cairo University, to IRIN [http://www.irinnews.org/report/93193/egypt-desertification-threat-to-local-food-production]. Scarcity of clean water is also a problem [http://www.irinnews.org/report/93045/egypt-sewage-fed-vegetable-plots-pose-health-risk]. Land is worked intensively and yields are high.\n\n[[Cotton]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[onion]]s, [[tobacco]], and [[bean]]s are the principal crops. Increasingly, a few modern techniques are applied to producing fruits, vegetables and flowers, in addition to cotton, for export. Further improvement is possible. The most common traditional farms occupy {{convert|1|acre|ha|order=flip}} each, typically in a canal-irrigated area along the banks of the Nile. Many small farmers also own cows, [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]s, and [[chicken]]s. Between 1953 and 1971, some farms were [[collective farming|collectivised]], especially in [[Upper Egypt]] and parts of the Nile Delta.\n\nSeveral researchers questioned the domestic (and import) policies for dealing with the so-called the \"wheat game\" since the former Minister of Agriculture [[Youssef Wali]] was in office.\n\nIn 2006, areas planted with wheat in Egypt exceeded {{convert|400,000|acre|ha|order=flip}} producing approximately 6 million [[metric ton]]s.<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/959/ec2.htm Sowing the right seeds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103193553/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/959/ec2.htm |date=3 January 2010 }}''Al-Ahram Weekly'', 6 August 2009</ref> The domestic supply price farmers receive in Egypt is EGP 1200 (<math> \\approx </math> US$211) per ton compared to approximately EGP 1940 (<math> \\approx </math> US$340) per ton for import from the USA, Egypt's main supplier of [[wheat]] and [[maize|corn]].

For the most part, it is a massive sandy plateau marked by seven major depressions. One of these, Fayoum, was connected about 3,600 years ago to the Nile by canals. Today, it is an important irrigated agricultural area.\n\nPractically all Egyptian agriculture takes place in some 25,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (6 million acres) of fertile soil in the Nile Valley and Delta.\n\nSome desert lands are being developed for agriculture, including the controversial but ambitious [[Toshka]] project in [[Upper Egypt]], but some other fertile lands in the [[Nile Valley]] and Delta are being lost to urbanization and erosion.\nLarger modern farms are becoming more important in the desert.\n\nThe agriculture objectives on the desert lands are often questioned; the desert farm lands which were offered regularly at different levels and prices were restricted to a limited group of elites selected very carefully, who later profiteered retailing the granted large desert farm land by pieces. This allegedly transforms the desert farms to tourist resorts, hits all government plans to develop and improve the conditions of the poor, and causes serious negative impact on agriculture and the overall national economy over time. One company, for example, bought over 70 hectares of large desert farm for a price as low as EGP 0.05 per square meter and now sells for EGP 300 per square meter. In numbers, 70 hectares bought for about US$6,000 in 2000 sells for over US$3.7 million in 2007. Currently, no clear solution exists to deal with these activities.\n\nAgriculture biomass, including agricultural wastes and animal manure, produce approximately 30 million metric tons of dry material per year that could be massively and decisively used, ''inter alia'', for generating bioenergy and improve the quality of life in rural Egypt. Unfortunately, this resource remain terribly underutilized.<ref>It is noteworthy that this point is emphasized in the context of the production of natural gas from biogas in Nawar, Abdel-Hameed (2005). \"The Emerging Landscape of the Natural Gas in Egypt\". Cairo University, manuscript. Natural gas can be mainly produced with crude oil from the same reservoir, i.e. associated, or from a natural gas reservoir, i.e. non-associated.</ref>\n\nSince early 2008, with the world food prices soaring, especially for grains, calls for striking a \"new deal\" on agriculture increased. Indeed, 2008 arguably marks the birth of a new national agriculture policy and reform.<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/919/sc5.htm Using what we have] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806190539/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/919/sc5.htm |date=6 August 2009 }}''Al-Ahram Weekly'',29 October 2008</ref>\n\nAcquisition and ownership of desert land in Egypt is governed by so-called \"[[Egyptian Desert Land Law]]\". It defines desert land as the land two kilometers outside the border of the city. Foreign partners and shareholders may be involved in ownership of the desert land, provided Egyptians own at least 51% of the capital.\n\n===Water resources===\n{{Main|Water resources management in modern Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Aswan Nile R21.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Nile]] river at [[Aswan]].]]\n\"Egypt\", wrote the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] 25 centuries ago, \"is the gift of the Nile.\" The land's seemingly inexhaustible resources of water and soil carried by this mighty river created in the Nile Valley and Delta the world's most extensive oasis. Without the Nile, Egypt would be little more than a desert wasteland.\n\nThe river carves a narrow, cultivated [[floodplain]], never more than 20 kilometers wide, as it travels northward toward [[Cairo]] from [[Lake Nasser]] on the [[Sudan]]ese border, behind the [[Aswan High Dam]]. Just north of Cairo, the Nile spreads out over what was once a broad estuary that has been filled by riverine deposits to form a fertile delta about {{convert|250|km|mi|sp=us}} wide at the seaward base and about {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} from south to north.\n\nBefore the construction of dams on the Nile, particularly the Aswan High Dam (started in 1960, completed in 1970), the fertility of the Nile Valley was sustained by the water flow and the silt deposited by the annual flood. Sediment is now obstructed by the Aswan High Dam and retained in Lake Nasser. The interruption of yearly, natural fertilization and the increasing salinity of the soil has been a manageable problem resulting from the dam. The benefits remain impressive: more intensive farming on thousands of square kilometers of land made possible by improved irrigation, prevention of flood damage, and the generation of millions of [[gigajoule]]s of electricity at low cost.\n\n===Groundwater===\nThe rain falling on the coast of the southern regions are the main source of recharge of the main reservoir. There is a free-floating layer of the reservoir water on top of sea water up to a distance of 20&nbsp;km south of the Mediterranean Sea. The majority of wells in the coastal plain depend on the water level in the main reservoir. The coastal water supply comes from water percolating through the coastal sand and water runoff from the south. This low salinity water is used for many purposes.\n\n===Mineral and energy resources===\n{{Main|Energy in Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Darfeel plat.png|thumb|300px|An offshore platform in the Darfeel Gas Field]]\nEgypt's mineral and energy resources include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[phosphate]]s, [[gold]] and [[iron ore]]. Crude oil is found primarily in the [[Gulf of Suez]] and in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]]. Natural gas is found mainly in the [[Nile Delta]], off the Mediterranean shore, and in the Western Desert. Oil and gas accounted for approximately 7% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] in fiscal year 2000/01.\n\nExport of petroleum and related products amounted to $2.6 billion in the year 2000. In late 2001, Egypt's benchmark \"Suez Blend\" was about $16.73 per barrel ($105/m\u00b3), the lowest price since 1999.\n\n[[File:Egypt oil imports.png|thumb|400px|Egypt's oil consumption is overtaking oil production.]]\n[[Crude oil]] production has been in decline for several years since its peak level in 1993, from {{convert|941000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 1993 to {{convert|873000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}  in 1997 and to {{convert|696000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 2005. (See Figure). At the same time, the domestic consumption of oil increased steadily ({{convert|531000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and {{convert|525000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 1997 and 2005 respectively), but in 2008, oil consumption reached to {{convert|697000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It is easy to see from the graph that a [[linear trend]] projects that domestic demand outpaced supply in (2008\u20132009), turning Egypt to a net importer of oil. To minimize this potential, the government of Egypt has been encouraging the exploration, production and domestic consumption of [[natural gas]]. Oil Production was {{convert|630|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in 2008, and natural gas output continued to increase and reached 48.3 billion cubic meters in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Egypt nat gas exports.png|thumb|400px|Egypt's net natural gas exports.<ref>http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=eg#ng</ref>]]\nDomestic resources meet only about 33% of Egypt's domestic demand, meaning large imports from [[Saudi Arabia]], [[UAE]] and [[Iraq]] are necessary.\n\nOver the last 15 years, more than 180 petroleum exploration agreements have been signed and multinational oil companies spent more than $27 billion in exploration companions. These activities led to the findings of about 18 crude oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in FY 2001. The total number of findings rose to 49 in FY 2005. As a result of these findings, crude [[oil reserves]] as of 2009 are estimated at {{convert|3.7|Goilbbl|m3}}, and proven natural gas reserves are 1.656 trillion cubic meters with likely additional discoveries with more exploration campaigns.\n\nIn August 2007, it was announced that signs of oil reserves in [[Kom Ombo]] basin, about {{convert|28|mi|km}} north of Aswan, was found and a concession agreement was signed with Centorion Energy International for drilling. The main natural gas producer in Egypt is the International Egyptian Oilfield Company (IEOC), a branch of Italian [[Eni]]. Other companies like BP, BG, Texas-based [[Apache Corp.]] and Shell carry out activities of exploration and production by means of concessions granted for a period of generally ample time (often 20 years) and in different geographic zones of oil and gas deposits in the country.\n\n[[Gold]] mining is more recently a fast-growing industry with vast untapped gold reserves in the Eastern Desert. To develop this nascent sector the Egyptian government took a first step by awarding mineral concessions, in what was considered the first international bid round. Two miners who have produced encouraging technical results include [[AngloGold Ashanti]] and [[Alexander Nubia International]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mariaan|first=Webb|title=AngloGold and JV partner to accelerate exploration in Egypt|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/anglogold-and-jv-partner-to-accelerate-exploration-in-egypt-2011-04-20|accessdate=7 September 2012|newspaper=Mining Weekly|date=20 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Balashov|first=Sergei|title=Northland says Alexander Nubia's Hamama project has significant potential|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/30758/northland-says-alexander-nubias-hamama-project-has-significant-potential-30758.html|accessdate=7 September 2012|newspaper=Proactive Investors|date=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nGold production facilities are now reality from the [[Sukari Hills]], located close to Marsa Alam in the Eastern Desert. The concession of the mine was granted to [[Centamin]], an Australian joint stock company, with a gold exploitation lease for a 160-square-kilometer area. Sami El-Raghy, Centamin Chairman, has repeatedly stated that he believes Egypt's yearly revenues from gold in the future could exceed the total revenues from the Suez Canal, tourism and the petroleum industry .<ref>See http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=7689 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211221850/http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=7689 |date=11 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources]] has established expanding the Egyptian [[petrochemical industry]] and increasing exports of natural gas as its most significant strategic objectives and in 2009 about 38% of local gas production was exported.\n\nAs of 2009, most Egyptian gas exports (approximately 70%) are delivered in the form of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) by ship to Europe and the United States. Egypt and [[Jordan]] agreed to construct the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] from [[Al Arish]] to [[Aqaba]] to export natural gas to Jordan; with its completion in July 2003, Egypt began to export {{convert|1.1|Gcuft|m3}} of gas per year via pipeline as well. Total investment in this project is about $220 million. In 2003, Egypt, Jordan and Syria reached an agreement to extend this pipeline to Syria, which paves the way for a future connection with Turkey, Lebanon and Cyprus by 2010. As of 2009, Egypt began to export to Syria {{convert|32.9|Gcuft|m3}} of gas per year, accounting for 20% of total consumption in [[Syria]].<ref>See http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Syria/NaturalGas.html</ref>\n\nIn addition, the East Mediterranean Gas (EMG), a joint company established in 2000 and owned by [[Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation]] (EGPC) (68.4%), the private Israeli company Merhav (25%) as well as [[Ampal-American Israel Corporation|Ampal-American Israel Corp.]] (6.6%), has been granted the rights to export natural gas from Egypt to Israel and other locations in the region via underwater pipelines from [[Al 'Arish]] to [[Ashkelon]] which will provide [[Israel Electric Corporation]] (IEC)  {{convert|170|Mcuft}} of gas per day. Gas supply started experimentally in the second half of 2007. As of 2008, Egypt produces about {{convert|6.3|Gcuft}}, from which Israel imports of  {{convert|170|Mcuft}} account for about 2.7% of Egypt's total production of natural gas. According to a statement released on 24 March 2008, Merhav and Ampal's director, Nimrod Novik, said that the natural gas pipeline from Egypt to Israel can carry up to 9 billion cubic meters annually which sufficiently meet rising demand in Israel in the coming years.<ref>BRIEF: Merhav exec insists gas pipeline is sufficient: \"The pipeline was designed, built, and tested by the top companies in their fields.\" Lior Baron. McClatchy - Tribune Business News. Washington: 24 March 2008.</ref>\n\nAccording to a memorandum of understanding, the commitment of Egypt is {{convert|680|Mcuft}} contracted for 15 years at a price below $3 per million of [[British thermal unit]], though this was renegotiated at a higher price in 2009 (to between $4 and $5 per million BTU), while the amounts of gas supplied were increased. Exporting natural gas to Israel faces broad popular opposition in Egypt.<ref>Nawar, Abdel-Hameed (2005). \"The Emerging Landscape of the Natural Gas in Egypt\". Cairo University, manuscript.</ref>\n\nAgreements between Egypt and Israel allow for Israeli entities to purchase up to 7 billion cubic meters of Egyptian gas annually, making Israel one of Egypt's largest natural gas export markets. The decision to export of natural gas to Israel was passed in 1993 at the time when Dr. Hamdy Al-Bambi was Minister of Petroleum and when Mr. [[Amr Moussa]] was Minister of Foreign Affairs. The mandate to sign of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to delegate to the Ministry of Petroleum represented by the Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) to contract with EMG Company was approved by the former Prime Minister Dr. [[Atef Ebeid]] in the Cabinet's meeting No. 68 on 5 July 2004 when he served as the acting \"President of the Republic\" when President [[Hosni Mubarak]] was receiving medical treatment in Germany.\n\nA new report by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] on the Cost of Conflict in the Middle East<ref name=\"strategicforesight.com\"/> also details how in the event of peace an oil and gas pipeline from Port Said to Gaza to Lebanon would result in a transaction value for Egypt to the tune of $1\u20132 billion per year.\n\nWith respect to nuclear energy, Egypt's last president, Hosni [[Mubarak]] on 29 October 2007, a few days before the Egyptian ruling party's annual conference, proudly gave the go-ahead for building several [[nuclear power plant]]s. Egypt's nuclear route is purely peaceful and fully transparent, but faces technical and financing obstacles. Egypt is a member of the [[IAEA]] and has both signed and ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).

Most ambitious of all the irrigation projects is that of the [[Aswan High Dam]], completed in 1971. A report published in March 1975 by the National Council for Production and Economic Affairs indicated that the dam had proved successful in controlling floodwaters and ensuring recurring water supply, but that water consumption had been more than needed and shall be controlled. Some precious land was lost below the dam because the flow of Nile silt was stopped, and increased salinity remains a major problem. Furthermore, five years of drought in the [[Ethiopia]] highlands\u2014the source of the Nile River's water\u2014caused the water level of [[Lake Nasser]], the Aswan High Dam's reservoir, to drop to the lowest level in 1987.\n\nIn 1996, the level of water behind the High Dam and in Lake Nasser reached the maximum level since the completion of the dam. Despite this unusual abundance of water supply, Egypt can only use 55.5 billion cu m (1.96 trillion cu ft) every year, according to the Nile Basin Agreement signed in 1959 between Egypt and [[Sudan]]. Another major project designed to address the [[water scarcity]] problem is the [[New Valley Project]] (the \"second Nile\"), aimed at development of the large artesian water supplies underlying the oases of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]].\n\nIn 2010 Egypt's fertile area totaled about 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million acres), about one-quarter of which has been reclaimed from the desert after the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].<ref name=faoun>{{cite web |title=Country profile \u2013 Egypt (Version 2016) |url=http://www.fao.org/3/i9729en/I9729EN.pdf |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref> The government aims to increase this number to 4.8 million hectares by 2030 through additional land reclamation.<ref name=faoun/> Even though only 3 percent of the land is arable, it is extremely productive and can be cropped two or even three times annually. However, the reclaimed lands only add 7 percent to the total value of agricultural production.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Surface irrigation]] is forbidden by law in reclaimed lands and is only used in the [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Nile Delta|Delta]], the use of [[irrigation sprinkler|pressurized irrigation]] and [[drip irrigation|localized irrigation]] is compulsory in other parts of the country.<ref name=faoun/> Most land is cropped at least twice a year, but agricultural productivity is limited by salinity which in 2011 affected 25% of irrigated agriculture to varying degrees.<ref name=faoun/> This is mainly caused by insufficient drainage as well as seawater intrusion in aquifers as a result of over-extraction of groundwater, the latter primarily affects the [[Nile Delta]].<ref name=faoun/> Thanks to the installation of drainage systems a reduction in salinized areas from about 1.2 million hectares in 1972 to 900 000 hectares in 2010 was achieved.<ref name=faoun/>\n\nIn the 1970s, despite significant investment in land reclamation, agriculture lost its position as the leading economic sector. Agricultural exports, which were 87% of all merchandise export by value in 1960, fell to 35% in 1974 and to 11% by 2001. In 2000, agriculture accounted for 17% of the country's GDP and employed 34% of the workforce.\n\n====Crops====\nAccording to [[List of largest producing countries of agricultural commodities|2013 statistics]] from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Egypt is the world's largest producer of [[date palm|dates]]; the second largest producer of [[Ficus|figs]]; the fourth largest producer of [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[onion]]s, [[buffalo milk]] and [[eggplant]]s as well as the fifth largest producer of [[tomato]]es and [[watermelon]].\n\n[[Cotton]] has long been a primary exported cash crop, but it is no longer vital as an export. Production in 1999 was 243,000 tons. Egypt is also a substantial producer of [[wheat]], corn, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables, fodder, and rice; substantial quantities of wheat are also imported, especially from the United States and Russia, despite increases in yield since 1970, and significant quantities of rice are exported.\n\n[[Citrus]], dates, and grapes are the main fruits by cultivated area. Agricultural output in tons in 1999 included corn, 9,350,000; wheat, 6,347,000; rice, 5,816,000; potatoes, 1,900,000; and oranges, 1,525,000.{{ clarify | date = August 2015 | reason = Units? Presumably metric tons. }} The government exercises a strong degree of control over agriculture, not only to ensure the best use of irrigation water but also to confine the planting of cotton in favor of food grains. However, the government's ability to achieve this objective is limited by crop rotational constraints.\n\n====Land ownership====\nThe agrarian reform law of 1952 provided that no one might hold more than 190 [[feddan]]s, that is, {{convert|79.8|ha|acre}} (1 Egyptian feddan=0.42 hectares=1.038 acres), for farming, and that each landholder must either farm the land himself or rent it under specified conditions. Up to 95 additional feddans might be held if the owner had children, and additional land had to be sold to the government. In 1961, the upper limit of landholding was reduced to 100 feddans, and no person was allowed to lease more than 50 feddans. Compensation to the former owners was in bonds bearing a low rate of interest, redeemable within 40 years. A law enacted in 1969 reduced landholdings by one person to 50 feddans.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, 90% of all land titles were for holdings of less than five feddans ({{convert|2.1|ha|acre|abbr=off}}), and about 300,000 families, or 8% of the rural population, had received land under the agrarian reform program. According to a 1990 agricultural census, there were some three million small land holdings, almost 96% of which were under five feddans. As these small landholdings restricted the ability of farmers to use modern machinery and agricultural techniques that improve and take advantage of [[economies of scale]], there have since the late 1980s been many reforms attempting to deregulate agriculture by liberalizing input and output prices and eliminating crop area controls. As a result, the gap between world and domestic prices for Egyptian agricultural commodities has been closed.\n\n===Industrial sector===\n\n====Automobiles manufacturing====\n[[File:MCV 600 coach 3 axles. Spielvogel 1.JPG|thumb|250px|A modern [[Manufacturing Commercial Vehicles|MCV]] 600 3-axles comfort coach assembled in Egypt.]]\n[[El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company]] is [[Egypt]]'s state owned automobile company, founded in 1960 in [[Helwan]], [[Egypt]]. Established in 1962, the company manufactures various vehicles under license from [[Zastava Automobili]], [[Daimler AG]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], and [[Peugeot]]. Their current lineup consists of the [[Jeep Liberty|Jeep Cherokee]]; the open-top, Wrangler-based Jeep AAV TJL; the [[Kia Spectra]]; the [[Peugeot 405]]; and the [[Peugeot 406]].\n\nOther automobile manufacturers in Egypt include [[Arab American Vehicles]], [[Egy-Tech Engineering]], [[Ghabbour Group]], WAMCO (Watania Automotive Manufacturing Company) and [[Manufacturing Commercial Vehicles|MCV]]. MCV was established in 1994 to represent [[Mercedes-Benz]] in the commercial vehicle sector in Egypt, producing a range of buses and trucks for domestic sale and for export throughout the [[Arab World]], Africa, Latin America and [[Eastern Europe]]. The manufacturing plant in [[El Salheya]] employs c. 2500 people.<ref>[http://www.mcv-eg.com/mcv/Factory.html ''Factory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613144914/http://www.mcv-eg.com/MCV/Factory.html |date=13 June 2015 }} MCV-Website. Retrieved 18. October 2015</ref>\n\n====Chemicals====\n[[ABU QIR Fertilizers and Chemicals Industries Company|Abu Qir Fertilizers Company]] is one of the largest producers of [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]]s in [[Egypt]] and the MENA region. It accounts for nearly 50% of all nitrogen fertilizer production in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The company was established in 1976 with the construction of its first ammonia [[urea]] production facility, located in [[Abu Qir]], 20 kilometers east of [[Alexandria]]. Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC) is also one of the largest producers of [[ammonia]] in the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Consumer electronics and home appliances====\n[[Olympic Group]] is the largest Egyptian company in the field of domestic appliances. The company mainly manufactures washing machines, air conditioners, refrigerators, electric water heaters and gas cookers.\n\n[[Bahgat Group]] is a leading company in the fields of electronics, home appliances, furniture and real estate. It also owns TV stations. The group is composed of the following companies: Egy Aircon, International Electronics Products, Electrical Home appliances, General Electronics and Trading, Goldi Trading, Goldi Servicing, Egy Medical, Egyptian Plastic Industry, Egy House, Egy Speakers, Egy Marble, Dreamland and Dream TV.\n\n====Steel industries====\n[[File:Edfu 23.JPG|thumb|250px|An industrial complex near [[Edfu]].]]\n\nIn 2016 Egypt was ranked the [[List of countries by steel production|27th]] largest steel producing country with a production of 5 million tons, down from the peak of 6.8 million tons in 2013. [[EZDK]] is the largest steel company in Egypt and the Middle East, today part of Ezz Industries. It owns four steel plants in [[Alexandria]], [[Sadat (city)|Sadat]], [[Suez]] and [[10th of Ramadan (city)|10th of Ramadan]]. It was ranked 87th on the list of the world's largest steel companies by the World Steel Association in 2015, with a production of 3.2 million tons.\n\n====Textiles and clothing====\nTextiles and clothing is one of the largest manufacturing and exporting processes in the country and a huge employment absorber. The Egyptian apparel industry is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. [[Egypt]]'s geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts as a springboard for exports.<ref>[http://www.euromonitor.com/apparel-in-egypt/report EuroMonitor Report] Retrieved 24 August 2012</ref>\n\nThe textile industry contributes with one quarter of Egypt's non-oil export proceeds, with Cotton textiles comprising the bulk of Egypt's TC export basket. The public sector accounts for 90% of cotton spinning, 60% of fabric production and 30% of apparel production in Egypt. Misr Fine Spinning and Weaving is the largest enterprise of its kind in Africa and the Middle East. The private sector apparel industry is one of the most dynamic manufacturing processes in Egypt.\n\nThe requirements of importers to Egypt of textiles and leather products were set out in the Egyptian [[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decrees]] 626/2011 and 660/2011. The Egyptian trade oversight agency, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120817030351/http://www.goeic.gov.eg/en/briefindex.asp General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC)], demanded in June 2012 that an inspection certificate accompany each shipment, unless the importer is pre-registered with the GOEIC. The Ministerial Decrees demand that imported goods certify their compliance with the mandatory quality and safety standards of [[Egypt]].\n\n[http://www.arafaholding.com/ Arafa Holding] is a global apparel manufacturer and retailer, operating through a strong vertically integrated platform at the local & international levels.\n\n===Construction and contracting sector===\n[[File:NileCityTowers.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A night view of the Nile City Towers. Orascom Construction Industries' headquarters is in the southern tower (on the right). The [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotel]] lies in-between the two towers]]\n\n[[Orascom Construction Industries]] is a leading Egyptian EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor, based in Cairo, Egypt and active in more than 20 countries. OCI was established in Egypt in 1938 and owned by Onsi Sawiris. It was nationalized in 1953 and then again de-nationalized in 1977. The company is the first multinational Egyptian corporation, and is one of the core [[Orascom Group]] companies.\nAs a cement producer, OCI owned and operated cement plants in Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan, northern Iraq and Spain, which had a combined annual production capacity of 21 million tonnes.\n\nThe [[Talaat Moustafa Group]] (TMG), one of the largest conglomerates in Egypt, was founded by the former Talaat Moustafa and is headed by his son, Tarek Talaat Moustafa.\n\n===Services sector===\n\n====Banking & insurance====\nThe banking sector has gone through many stages since the establishment of the first bank in 1856, followed by the emergence of private sector and joint venture banks during the period of the Open Door Policy in the 1970s. Moreover, the Egyptian banking sector has been undergoing reforms, privatization, and mergers and acquisitions from 1991 up to today.\n\nThe banking system comprises 57 state owned commercial banks. This includes 28 commercial banks, four of which are state-owned, 26 investment banks (11 joint venture banks and 15 branches of foreign banks), and three specialized banks. Although private and joint venture banks are growing, many remain relatively small with few branch networks.\n\nEgypt's banking system has undergone major reforms since the 1990s and today consumers are faced with a liberalized and modernized system which is supervised and regulated according to internationally accepted standards.\nAlthough the mortgage market is underdeveloped in Egypt and as yet foreigners cannot yet obtain a mortgage for a property in Egypt. In the near future, a new mortgage law will enable purchasers to take out property loans. This will open up the market considerably and create a storm of development and real estate activity in the near future.\n\n====Communications====\n{{Main|Communications in Egypt}}[[File:Qesm Marsa Alam, Red Sea Governorate, Egypt - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|250px|Road in [[Marsa Alam]].]]\nEgypt has long been the cultural and informational centre of the Arab world, and Cairo is the region's largest publishing and broadcasting centre.\n\nThe telecommunications liberalisation process started in 1998 and is still ongoing, but at a slow pace. Private sector companies operate in mobile telephony, and Internet access. There were 10 million fixed phone lines, 31 million mobile phones, and 8.1 million Internet users by the August 2007.\n\n====Transport====\n{{Main|Transport in Egypt}}\n[[File:Metro-1-l.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Cairo Metro]].]]\n\nTransport in Egypt is centered around Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile. The main line of the nation's {{convert|4,800|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]]. The road network has expanded rapidly to over {{convert|21000|mi|km}}, covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases.\n\nIn addition to overseas routes, Egypt Air provides reliable domestic air service to major tourist destinations from its Cairo hub. The Nile River system (about {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}}.) and the principal canals (1,600&nbsp;km.) are used for local transportation.\n\nThe Suez Canal is a major waterway for international commerce and navigation, linking the Mediterranean and Red Sea. It is run by the [[Suez Canal Authority]], headquartered in [[Port Said]]. The ministry of transportation, along with other governmental bodies are responsible for transportation in Egypt. Major ports are Alexandria, Port Said, and Damietta on the Mediterranean, and Suez, Ain Sokhna and Safaga on the Red Sea.\n\n====Tourism sector====\n{{Main|Tourism in Egypt}}\nThe Egyptian tourism industry is one of the most important sectors in the economy, in terms of high employment and incoming foreign currency.<ref>{{Cite report |date=October 2010 |title=Egypt's Tourism Industry |url= http://www.alexbank.com/Uploads/documents/research/Tourism%20industry%20in%20Egypt.pdf|publisher= [[Bank of Alexandria]]|page= 7|docket= |accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> It has many constituents of tourism, mainly historical attractions especially in [[Cairo]], [[Luxor]] and [[Aswan]], but also beach and other sea activities.

The market for telecommunications market was officially deregulated since the beginning of 2006 according to the [[WTO]] agreement.\n\nThe government established [[ITIDA]] through Law 15 of the year 2004 as governmental entity. This agency aims at paving the way for the diffusion of the e-business services in Egypt capitalizing on different mandates of the authority as activating the Egyptian e-signature law and supporting an export-oriented IT sector in [[Egypt]].\n\nWhile the move could open the market for new entrants, add and improve the infrastructure for its network, and in general create a competitive market, the fixed line market is de facto monopolized by [[Telecom Egypt]].\n\nThe cellular phone market was a [[duopoly]] with prices artificially high but witnessed in the past couple of years the traditional price war between the incumbents [[Mobinil]] and [[Vodafone]]. A 500 minutes outbound local and long distance calling plan currently costs approximately US$30 as compared to approximately US$90 in 2005. While the current price is not so expensive, it is still above the international price as plans never allow \"unlimited night & weekend minutes.\"\n\nA third [[GSM 3.5G]] license was awarded in April 2006 for US$3 billion to a consortium led by the UAE company [[Etisalat|Eitesalat]] (66%), [[Egypt Post]] (20%), the [[National Bank of Egypt]] (NBE) (10%), and the NBE's Commercial International Bank (4%), thus moving the market from [[duopoly]] to [[oligopoly]].\n\nOn 24 September 2006, the [[National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority]] (NTRA) announced a license award to Egyptian-Arab private sector consortium of companies to extend a maritime cable for international traffic. The US$120 million cable project will serve the Gulf region and south Europe. The construction of the cable should decrease the currently high international call costs and increase domestic demand on internet broadband services, in importantly increase exports of international telecommunication services of Egyptian companies, mostly in the [[Smart Village]].\n\nIt is expected that NTRA will award two licenses for international gateways using open technology and deploy [[WiMax]] technology enabling the delivery of [[last-mile wireless broadband]] access as an alternative to [[ADSL]].\n\nThe main barrier to growth for Egypt's ICT sector is the monopoly of telecommunication corporations and quarreling workforce.\n\n==Largest companies==\n{{Main|List of companies of Egypt}}\nIn 2009, 3 Egyptian companies were listed in the Forbes Global 2000 list - an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine.

The government, however, has instituted a number of policy changes and reforms specifically intended to develop internal private equity funds and to attract private equity funding from international sources.\n\nThe major industries include [[textiles]], [[hydrocarbon]] and [[chemical production]], and generic pharmaceutical production. Unemployment is high at about 10.5%.<ref>[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/private_equity_egyptpakistanisrael.pdf ''Private Equity in Pakistan, Israel, and Egypt''], by [[Arjun Sethi (businessman)|Sethi, Arjun]] November 2007.</ref>\n\nUntil 2003, the Egyptian economy suffered from shortages in foreign currency and excessively elevated interest rates. A series of budget reforms were conducted in order to redress weaknesses in Egypt's economic environment and to boost private sector involvement and confidence in the economy.\n\nMajor [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] reforms were introduced in 2005 in order to tackle the [[informal sector]] which according to estimates represents somewhere between 30% to 60% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. Significant tax cuts for corporations were introduced for the first time in Egyptian history. The new Income tax Law No 91 for 2005 reduced the tax rate from 40% to 20%. According to government figures, tax filing by individuals and corporations increased by 100%.\n\nMany changes were made to cut trade tariffs. Among the legislators' goals were tackling the [[Black Market|black market]], reducing bureaucracy and pushing through trade liberalization measures. Amendments to Investment and Company law were introduced in order to attract foreign investors. For example, the number of days required for establishing a company was dramatically reduced.\n\nSignificant improvement to the domestic economic environment increased investors' confidence in Egypt. The [[Cairo & Alexandria Stock Exchange]] is considered among the best ten emerging markets in the world. The changes to the policy also attracted increased levels of foreign direct investment in Egypt. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development's World Investment Report, Egypt was ranked the second largest country in attracting foreign investment in Africa.\n\nGiven the large number of amendments to laws and regulations, Egypt has succeeded to a certain extent in conforming to international standards. Very recently the [[Cairo & Alexandria Stock Exchange]] (CASE) was welcomed with full membership into the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE)\u2014the first Arab country to be invited.\n\nEnforcement of these newly adopted regulatory frameworks remain, sometime problematic. Problems like corruption hamper economic development in Egypt. Many scandals involving bribery were reported during the past years. \"In 2002 alone, as many as 48 high-ranking officials\u2014including former cabinet ministers, provincial governors and MPs were convicted of influence peddling, profiteering and embezzlement. Maintaining good relations with politicians is sometimes a key to business success in Egypt. On a scale from 0 to 10 (with 0 being highly corrupt), Egypt scored a 3.3 .\n\nAccording to a study by the [[International Organization for Migration]], 20% of Egyptian remittance-receiving households interviewed channelled the remittances towards various forms of investment, while the large majority (80%) was more concerned about utilizing remittances for meeting the daily needs of their families including spending on health care and education. Among the 20% of households that decided to invest, 39% invested in real estate, 22% invested in small businesses employing fewer than five people and the smallest proportions of investors (6%) invested in medium private business employing no more than 20 people. According to Egypt's Human Development Report 2008, despite representing approximately 5% of GDP, remittances provided the initial capital for only 1.4% of newly established small and medium enterprises in Egypt in 2003-2004.<ref name=\"egypt.iom.int\"/>\n\n==Response to the global financial crisis==\nThe challenges of the global food crisis followed by challenges of the global financial crisis made room for more integrated policy reforms. Considering the massive economic measures that have been taken over the past 12 months or so, Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory policy are altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: goods market (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and bond) market. Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven\u2014at least partially\u2014by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.\n\nEgypt has a population of about 97 million, with the population concentrated within a region {{convert|20|mi|km}} on either side of the [[Nile River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> The majority of the population is employed in the services sector, followed by agriculture and industrial production. Approximately one-third of Egyptian labour is engaged directly in [[farming]], and many others work in the processing or trading of agricultural products.\n\nUnemployment rate increased from 10.3% in FY2004 to 11.2% in 2005. The average rate of growth of employment in the publicly owned enterprises sector was -2% per year between FY1998 and FY2005 as a result of aggressive privatization program. On the other hand, private sector employment grew at an average rate of 3% over that period. In addition, the government sector employment grew by almost double the rate of the private sector over the same period.\n\nIn general, the average weekly wage in the private sector is, in many instances, higher than that of the public sector. In some other instances, e.g. whole sale and retail trades, the weekly wage is lower by half of that in the public sector.\n\nAs a result of the weakness role of the Ministry of Manpower and Trade Unions to create a balance between the rights of workers and the interests of owners of companies in the private sector, privatization has led to worsening employment problems and deterioration in their working environment and health, and many workers have recently resorted to strike and picketing.\n\nIn an effort to quell discontent over rising food prices, Egypt offered government and public sector workers a pay rise of up to 30%, and urged the private sector to keep up with the pay rise. The offer came on the May day speech delivered by President [[Mubarak]] to the Egyptian General Federation of Trade Unions.\n\n\"We must go in dealing with the current global (food) crisis, on two basic tracks (1) we must strengthen the food security of our low-income people, (2) we must achieve a balance between wages and prices.\" President [[Mubarak]] said.\n\nThe pay rise originally proposed in the government budget ranged between 15%\u201320%, but the decision to double it was given on heightened worries that widespread anger over prices could lead to a social explosion. The pay rise is initiated immediately, rather than waiting for the start of the new fiscal year on 1 July 2008 and is to be financed from real resources.\n\nWhile the headline CPI inflation rate was 15.8% (17.6% in rural areas, 14.4% in urban areas) in March 2008, the overall food price inflation rate was 23.7% (26.9% in rural areas, 20.5% in urban areas). Moreover, in April 2008 in urban areas, the headline CPI inflation rate reached 16.4% while food price inflation rate was 22.0%. This underlines the statement in Nawar (2008) that \"the inflation rate as measured by the headline CPI does not concern the poor and low-income people, who are the majority of people in rural and urban Egypt, since they spend most of their income on food.\" Approximately 55 million poor and low-income citizens, representing about 75% of the population, are currently enrolled in food ration cards.\n\nIn April 2009 it was reported that Egypt feared the return of 500,000 Egyptian laborers working in the Gulf states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/248.html|title=IPR - Egypt fears return of 500,000 workers from Gulf|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Poverty and income distribution==\n\nEven though there are spots with a facade of affluence, [[Egypt]] is actually facing high levels of [[unemployment]] and immense [[poverty]].

Data from a World Bank and Ministry of Economic Development poverty assessment based on comparisons between actual expenditures (and the cost of a consumption basket securing 2470 calories per day per person), shows that individual Egyptians who spent less than EGP 995 per year in 2005 are considered extreme poor, those who spent less than EGP 1423 per year are poor and those who spent less than EGP 1853 per year are near poor.\n\nOverall about 44.4% of the Egyptian population are in the range of extreme poor to near poor:<ref>Nawar, Abdel-Hameed (2007) \"From Marina to Kom-Ombo: A Note on Poverty in Egypt\", Cairo University, manuscript, August</ref>\n\n* 21% of the Egyptian population was near poor, meaning that about 14.6 million Egyptians can obtain their basic food requirements in addition to some basic services.\n* 19.6% of the Egyptian population was poor, meaning that about 13.6 million Egyptians (one out of every five) had consumption expenditure below the poverty line and could not therefore obtain their basic food and non-food needs.\n* 3.8% of the Egyptian population was extreme poor, meaning that about 2.6 million of the Egyptian poor could not obtain their basic food requirements even if they spent all their expenditure on food.\n\nPoverty has a strong regional dimension in Egypt and concentrates in [[Upper Egypt]], both urban (18.6%) and rural (39.1), while metropolitan areas are the least poor (5.7%). The government is currently employing recently completed [[poverty map]] as tool for [[geographic targeting]] of public resources.\n\n==Causes of poverty==\n\n===High cost of doing business===\n\nAccording to Rapid Assessment surveys conducted by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory [[policy uncertainty]] high on the list of obstacles to creating and growing a business.<ref name=\"doingbusiness.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Subnational-Reports/DB14-Egypt.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213060805/http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Subnational-Reports/DB14-Egypt.pdf |archive-date=13 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These impediments have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import\u2014as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports.<ref name=\"doingbusiness.org\"/> The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment.

Corruption Rank in Egypt averaged 86.48 from 1996 until 2017, reaching an all time high of 118 in 2012 and a record low of 41 in 1996. Facilitation payments are regarded as bribery in many countries, which prevents many foreign entities from financial involvement with Egypt since they are a required part of doing business.

In 2000, Radio Cairo introduced new specialized (thematic) channels on its FM station. So far, they include news, music, and sports. Radio enjoys more freedom than TV in its news programs, talk shows and analysis.\n\nStarting 2003, [[Nile Radio Productions]], a private company, was given license to operate two radio stations; [[Nile FM]] and [[Nogoum FM]]. Nile FM broadcasts in [[English language|English]] and Nogoom FM broadcasts in [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]]. Both stations mostly broadcast mainly to the [[Greater Cairo]] region.

ETV sells its specially produced programs and soap operas to the entire Arab world. ETV has two main channels, six regional channels, and three satellite channels. Of the two main channels, Channel I uses mainly Arabic, while Channel II is dedicated to foreigners and more cultured viewers, broadcasting news in English and French as well as Arabic.\n\nEgyptian Satellite channels broadcast to the Middle East, Europe, and the U.S. East Coast. In April 1998, Egypt launched its own satellite known as NileSat 101. Seven specialized channels cover news, culture, sports, education, entertainment, health, and drama. A second, digital satellite, Nilesat 102, was launched in August 2000. Many of its channels are rented to other stations.\n\nThree new private satellite-based TV stations were launched in November 2001, marking a great change in Egyptian government policy. Dream TV 1 and 2 produce cultural programming, broadcast contemporary video clips and films featuring Arab and international actors, as well as soap operas; another private station focuses on business and general news. Both private channels transmit on NileSat.\n\nIn addition to Egyptian programming, the Middle East Broadcast Company, a Saudi television station transmitting from London (MBC), Arab Radio and Television (ART), Al-Jazeera television, and other Gulf stations as well as Western networks such as CNN and BBC, provide access to more international programs to Egyptians who own satellite receivers.\n\n=== Landline telephony ===\n:''See also [[Telephone numbers in Egypt]]\n\nCurrently, there is a single company in charge of landline telephony, [[Telecom Egypt]] which is also government-controlled.\n\n=== Cellular communications ===\n:''See also [[Telephone numbers in Egypt]]\n\nCurrently, there are four companies which offer cellular communication service: [[Orange Egypt|Orange]], [[Vodafone Egypt|Vodafone]], [[Etisalat Egypt|Etisalat]], and We (by [[Telecom Egypt]]).

Field Marshal Amer created a new command interposed between the general staff and the Eastern Military District commander, Lieutenant General [[Salah ad-Din Muhsin]].<ref name=PollackAW60>Pollack, 2002, 60.</ref> This new Sinai Front Command was placed under General [[Abdel Mohsin Murtagi]], who had returned from Yemen in May 1967. Six of the seven divisions in the Sinai (with the exception of the [[20th Infantry Division (Egypt)|20th Infantry 'Palestinian' Division]]) had their commanders and chiefs of staff replaced. What fragmentary information is available suggests to authors such as Pollack that Amer was trying to improve the competence of the force, replacing political appointees with veterans of the Yemen war.<ref name=PollackAW60 />\n\nAfter the war began on 5 June 1967, Israel attacked Egypt, destroyed its air force on the ground, and occupied the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The forward deployed Egyptian forces were shattered in three places by the attacking Israelis. Field Marshal Amer, overwhelmed by events, and ignoring previous plans, ordered a retreat by the Egyptian Army to the Suez Canal.<ref>Dupuy, 1978, 267\u20139.</ref> This developed into a rout as the Israelis harried the retreating troops from the ground and from the air.\n\nScholars such as [[Kenneth Pollack]], deAtkine, and Robert Springborg have identified a number of reasons why Arab (and Egyptian) armies performed so poorly against Israel from 1948 to 1991 and afterwards. In battle against Israel from 1948\u201391, junior officers consistently demonstrated an unwillingness to manoeuvre, \u2018innovate, improvise, take initiative, or act independently\u2019.<ref>Pollack, ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948\u20131991'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8032-3733-2}}, 146.</ref> Ground forces units suffered from constant manipulation of information and an inattention to intelligence gathering and objective analysis. Units from the two divisions dispatched to Saudi Arabia in 1990\u201391, accompanied by U.S. personnel during the 1991 Gulf War, consistently reported fierce battles even though they actually encountered little or no resistance. This occurred whether or not they were accompanied by U.S. military personnel or journalists.<ref>Pollack, 2002, 144.</ref> Later researchers such as Springborg have confirmed that the tendencies identified in the 1980s and 1990s persist in the Armed Forces in the twenty-first century.<ref>Springborg, Robert. \"Learning from failure: Egypt.\" The Routledge Handbook of Civil-Military Relations. London: Routledge (2013): 93\u2013109.</ref>\n\n==Army==\n[[File:Egyptian Mi-8 Hip helicopters after unloading troops.jpg|thumb|Egyptian Mi-8 Hip helicopters after unloading troops]]\nThe inventory of the Egyptian armed forces includes equipment from the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Equipment from the Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern U.S., French, and British equipment, a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt, such as the [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams]] [[tank]].\n\nConscripts for the [[Egyptian Army]] and other service branches without a university degree serve three years as enlisted soldiers. Conscripts with a General Secondary School Degree serve two years as enlisted personnel. Conscripts with a university degree serve one year as enlisted personnel or three years as a reserve officer.

Currently, the backbone of the EAF is the [[F-16]]. The [[Mirage 2000]] is the other modern interceptor used by the EAF. The Egyptian Air Force has 216 F-16s (plus 20 on order).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It has about 579 combat aircraft and 149 armed helicopters as it continues to fly extensively upgraded [[MiG-21]]s, [[F-7 Skybolt]]s, [[F-4 Phantom]]s, [[Dassault Mirage V]]s, and the [[C-130 Hercules]] among other planes.\nEgypt currently operates 11 Dassault Rafale a French twin-engine fighter aircraft as of July 2017 with another 24 on order.\n\n[[File:Egyptian air force pilot.jpg|thumb|left|An Egyptian F16C Pilot]]\n\n==Air Defense Forces==\nThe [[Egyptian Air Defense Forces]] or ADF (Quwwat El Diffaa El Gawwi in Arabic) is Egypt's military command responsible for air defense. Egypt patterned its Air Defense Force (ADF) after the [[Soviet Air Defence Force]], which integrated all its air defense capabilities \u2013 antiaircraft guns, rocket and missile units, interceptor planes, and radar and warning installations. It appears to comprise five subordinate divisions, 110 surface-to-air missile battalions, and 12 anti-aircraft artillery brigades.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forces Armees Africaines 2016\u20132017|last=Touchard|first=Laurent|publisher=Laurent Touchard|year=2017|isbn=9781545499801|location=Paris|pages=58}}</ref> Personnel quality may be 'several notches below' that of the Air Force personnel.<ref>Touchard, 2017, 77.</ref>\n\nIts commander is [[Lieutenant General]] [[Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen]].\n\n==Navy==\nThe [[Egyptian Navy]] was established after the [[Second World War]].

The Coast Guard is responsible for the onshore protection of public installations near the coast and the patrol of coastal waters to prevent smuggling. it has an inventory consisting of about thirty five large patrol craft (each between twenty and thirty meters in length) and twenty smaller Bertram-class coastal patrol craft built in the United States.\n\n''See [[list of naval ships of Egypt]] for a list of vessels in service.''\n\n==Arab Organization for Industrialization==\nThe [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]] supervises nine military factories which produce civilian goods as well as military products. Initially the owners of AOI were the governments of [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], before the latter governments gave their shares back to Egypt in 1993, valued at $1.8 billion. AOI now is entirely owned by the government of Egypt. AOI has about 19,000 employees out of which are 1250 engineers.

Egypt's foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and within the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] as a whole. [[Cairo]] has been a crossroads of the [[Arab world]]'s commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and [[Islam]]ic institutions are at the center of the region's social and cultural landmarks.\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===Arab relations===\nThe [[Arab League]] headquarters is in [[Cairo]], and the Secretary General of the League is traditionally an Egyptian. Former [[Egyptian Foreign Minister]] [[Nabil Elaraby|Nabil Araby]] is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.\n\nEgypt is on good terms with [[Libya]], its western neighbor.\n\nEgypt has fairly good relations with [[Sudan]], its southern neighbor, although it has a land dispute with Sudan over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]], a small area of land on the Egypt-Sudan border on the [[Red Sea]] coast. Sudan claims the area. Egypt's policy on Sudan is that it is in favor of a united Sudan. As such Egypt was not directly involved in the Sudan Peace Process that was hosted in Kenya under the auspices of [[IGAD]] and that gave the peoples of south Sudan the right to secede and form an independent state in 2011 after the long and brutal Sudanese civil war that cumulatively lasted more than 40 years and claimed over 2 million lives.\n\n===Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict===\nEgypt has been seeking to play a role in the resolution of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]].\n\nEgypt played an important role in the negotiations leading to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], which, under [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sponsorship, brought together all parties in the region, including for the first time a Palestinian delegation, to discuss Middle East peace.\n\nThis support has continued to the present, with former President [[Hosni Mubarak]] often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the Sharm El-Sheikh \"Summit of the Peacemakers\" attended by President [[Bill Clinton]] and other world leaders.\n\nIn 2000, he hosted two summits at [[Sharm El-Sheikh]] and one at [[Taba Summit|Taba]] in an effort to resume the Camp David negotiations suspended in July 2000, and in June 2003, Mubarak hosted President [[George W. Bush]] for another summit on Middle East peace process. Another summit was convened in Sharm El Sheik in early 2005, which was attended by Egypt, [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian Authority]] and [[Jordan]]. The Egyptian Chief of Intelligence, General [[Omar Suleiman]], has played a substantial role in negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and is highly respected on both sides.\n\n==Africa==\nIn the 21st-century Egypt has encountered a major problem with immigration, as millions of Africans attempt to enter Egypt fleeing poverty and war.  Border control methods can be \"harsh, sometimes lethal.\" This has strained relations with Egypt's southern neighbors, and with Israel and the members of the EU as these immigrants attempt to move on to wealthier countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desperate on the Border|author=Soussi, Alasdair|publisher=Jerusalem Report|date=November 9, 2008|url= http://www.jpost.com/JerusalemReport/Article.aspx?id=119897|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEgypt currently occupies the [[Hala'ib Triangle]] of [[Sudan]], an area of land located on the [[Red Sea]] coast, between the political borders (at the [[22nd parallel north|22nd circle of latitude]]) and the administrative boundary between the two countries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

[[Sadat]] realized that reaching a settlement of the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] is a precondition for Egyptian development. To achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance US\u2013Egyptian relations to foster a peace process with Israel. After a seven-year hiatus, both countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations on February 28, 1974.\n\n===Military cooperation===\n\nFollowing the peace treaty with Israel, between 1979 and 2003, the US has provided Egypt with about $19 billion in military aid, making Egypt the second largest non-NATO recipient of US military aid after Israel. Also, Egypt received about $30 billion in economic aid within the same time frame. In 2009, the US provided a military assistance of US$1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.3|2009|r=2}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}), and an economic assistance of US$250 million (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|2009|r=1}}}} million in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).<ref name=\"09CAIRO874\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09CAIRO874.html|title=Scenesetter: President Mubarak's visit to Washington|date=2009-05-19|publisher=US Department of State|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127035045/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09CAIRO874.html|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}</ref>\nIn 1989 both Egypt and Israel became a [[Major non-NATO ally]] of the United States.\n\nMilitary cooperation between the US and Egypt is probably the strongest aspect of their strategic partnership. General [[Anthony Zinni]], the former Commandant of the [[US Central Command]] (CENTCOM), once said, \"Egypt is the most important country in my area of responsibility because of the access it gives me to the region.\" Egypt was also described during the [[Clinton Administration]] as the most prominent player in the Arab world and a key US ally in the Middle East. US military assistance to Egypt was considered part of the administration's strategy to maintaining continued availability of Persian Gulf energy resources and to secure the Suez Canal, which serves both as an important international oil route and as critical route for US warships transiting between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and either the [[Indian Ocean]] or the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\nThe Egyptian military provides indirect support for the foreign policy of Egypt in the region. Egypt is the strongest military power on the African continent, and the whole Middle East\n\n===War on Terror===\n\nDespite differences and periods of friction in relations between the two countries, the US-Egyptian relations under Mubarak have evolved moving beyond the Middle East peace process towards an independent bilateral friendship. It was in the US interest that Egypt was able to present moderate voice in Arab councils and persuade other Arab states to join the peace process and to normalize their relations with the US.\n\nHowever lately Egyptian-American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the US in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks, but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed US military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq, continued to oppose US occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with US requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella.\n\nThe issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole.

[[Libya]] currently has observer status at certain meetings. Since the enlargement, in May 2004 and January 2007, the co-operation covers 35 countries, the EU of 27, including [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] and the 10 Mediterranean Partners.\n\nEgypt has also taken an active role regarding Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, such as its participation in the technical meeting of which it was the speaker for the Arab group. Additionally, the first meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary assembly was co-chaired by an Egyptian.\n\nEgypt has been one of the leading recipients among the Mediterranean partners in terms of total funds received from the [[MEDA programme]], the principal financial instrument of the European Union for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is focused on policy-led, national structural reform and liberalisation programmes with a sector-wide approach.\n\nThe EU is Egypt\u2019s biggest trading partner currently accounting for 42% of Egyptian exports and 37% of imports, with the [[balance of trade]] still in the EU's favour. Trade between the EU and Egypt has risen by more than 5% in the last five years to reach around 11.6 billion euro in 2004. Egypt\u2019s main exports to the EU in 2004 were energy (39%), textiles and clothing (15%), agricultural products (9%), and chemicals (5%). Major imports from the EU were power generating machinery (21%), chemicals (16%), transport equipment (16%), and food and agricultural products (10%). Egypt has a serious but improving trade deficit that has put considerable pressure on the [[Egyptian pound]].\n\nTrade relations with the EU are good although there are several outstanding trade and phyto-sanitary issues. These range from specific market access issues and difficulties for businesses facing a highly regulated and complex system through to restrictions in the export of agricultural goods (potatoes) and fishery products because they do not conform with EU quality norms.\n\nEgypt is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\n\nSome time after the starting of the [[Arab Spring]], in March 2011 the [[European Union]] adopted the joint declaration \u2018 A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean', aimed at making a number of initiatives in the field of civic society support, financial assistance and further access to the EU market dependent upon advancement in the democratization process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/neighbourhood/arab_spring/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402172208/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/neighbourhood/arab_spring/index_en.htm |archive-date=2014-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs far as Egypt was concerned this declaration envisioned the further deepening of the previous Free Trade Agreement stipulated in 2004, geared towards the inclusion of areas such as trade in services, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, and investment protection. To the 2011 declaration, a preliminary phase of the negotiations followed in June 2013, when the EU and [[Egypt]] began an exploratory dialogue on how to deepen trade and investment relations, in particular through the possible negotiation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/EU_Seeks_To_Resume_Talks_On_DCFTA_With_Egypt____63682.html|title=EU Seeks To Resume Talks On DCFTA With Egypt|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the bloody crackdown in August 2014, [[European Union]] discussed the possibility of revising provision of aid to [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/19/us-egypt-protests-eu-idUSBRE97I0PU20130819|title=EU foreign ministers to discuss how to press Egypt over bloodshed|work=Reuters|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>  However, divisions over the appropriate stance to adopt among European diplomats persisted, coupled by the fear that the vacuum might be soon filled by other actors, following a Saudi Foreign Minister's declaration that the Kingdom was ready to step in<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782685|title=BBC News - EU suspends arms sales to Egypt over crackdown|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> and those of Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi about the possibility to appeal to Russia for foreign aid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201382153414138265.html|title=Egypt PM defiant on threat of aid cut|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>  Therefore, the only measure upon which the Foreign Ministers agreed was to suspend the sale of arms and materials that could be used for repression,<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> but fell short to halt aid program which could damage civil society.\n\nEarlier in July 2013, EU High Representative [[Catherine Ashton]] had visited Egypt in an attempt to promote reconciliation among the parties involved.

In the early 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the territory, incorporating it into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] ruled from [[Mexico City]]. However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus, which would be colonized in 1524. In 1609 the area became the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain, which took place in 1821, as part of the [[First Mexican Empire]], then further seceded, as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], in 1823.

The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the indigenous [[Pipil people]] had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico, but recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil.\n\nPedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of [[Cuzcatlan]] (El Salvador), in June 1524.<ref name=\"NicholsPool2012\">\n{{cite book\n|author1=Deborah L.

Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of [[Acajutla]] and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala where the people believed the Spanish were gods. He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language.\n\nThe Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAlvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, \"If you want your weapons, come get them\". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.\n\n[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]\nThe Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbors. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.\n\nIn 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf\n|title=World Directory of Minorities\n|author=Minority Rights Group International\n|accessdate=June 3, 2016\n}}\n</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.\n\nFor ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibuc\u00e1]].\n\nAntu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.\n\n=== Spanish rule (1525\u20131821)===\n[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendancia]]'' in 1786.\n\nTowards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.\n\nIn November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.\n\n=== Independence (1821) ===\nIn 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\nIn early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)\n\nWhen the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.\n\nAfter the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author=Thomas P.

In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tom\u00e1s Regalado]]\nIn 1898, Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed July 11, 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]\nAraujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on March 1, 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]].\n\nIn December 1931, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Mart\u00ednez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.\n\nThe Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>\n{{cite book|author=Thomas P.

Mart\u00ednez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.\n\nThe U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Mart\u00ednez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Mart\u00ednez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.\n\nFrom December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Mart\u00ednez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.\n\nIn the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Mart\u00ed was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Mart\u00ed returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte]].]]\nThey helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a \"peaceful meeting\" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Mart\u00ednez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Mart\u00ednez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Mart\u00ed shot after a perfunctory hearing.\n\nHistorically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm El Salvador \u2013 Demographics]\".

Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.\n\n=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)===\n{{Further information|Salvadoran Civil War}}\n\nIn October 1979, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen.

In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 \u2013 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Mason\n|first=T.D.\n|author2=D.A.

It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the \"[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascor\u00e1n River|Goascor\u00e1n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel]].\n\nThere are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km\u00b2). [[Lake G\u00fcija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km\u00b2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerr\u00f3n Grande]] (135&nbsp;km\u00b2). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.\n\nEl Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of El Salvador}}\n[[File:El Salvador Topography.png|thumb|El Salvador's topography.]]\n\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).\n\n===Natural disasters===\n\n====Extreme weather events====\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatit\u00e1n]]]]\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] and [[La Ni\u00f1a]] effects. Severe deforestation and soil erosion have made the landscape vulnerable to landslides and forest fires. These characteristics, coupled with severe fiscal constraints, make the nation highly susceptible to the impacts of extreme weather events.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On October 4, 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name=\"tdfiyp\"/> In 2010, losses to agriculture from flooding exceeded USD100 million, while those resulting from drought were USD38 million.<ref>''Winds of change for facing climate change in El Salvador: Foundations for a National Strategy'', 2012.</ref>\n\nEl Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean.

Hurricanes used to strike El Salvador infrequently, only came from the Atlantic and were limited to the months of September and October.

Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.\n\nRecent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.\n\nDespite these efforts, much remains to be done.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main article|Politics of El Salvador}}\nThe 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]\n# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years.

The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.\n\nThe political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.

During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.\n\n[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic center of El Salvador and home to the \"Carnival of San Miguel\", one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.<ref name=\"Herrera-Sobek2012\">{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&pg=PA459|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=459}}</ref>]]\nThe government has sought to improve the collection of its current [[revenue]]s, with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10% [[value-added tax]] (IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995.\n\n[[Inflation]] has been steady and among the lowest in the region. Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit, from $2.01 billion to $4.12 billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade Balance, Annual and Monthly Accumulated|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014112428/http://bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:El Chorreron, San Fernando, El Salvador.jpg|thumb|upright|El Chorreron, El Salvador; tourism is the fastest-growing sector of the Salvadoran economy.]]\n\nEl Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of privatization extending to telecommunications, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style = class=\"bonita\" style=\"float:left; margin:0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding:0.5em; font-size:95&nbsp;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Exports to\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imports from\n|-\n!

Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).\n\nRemittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador.

Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.\n\nMoney from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]\n\nIn 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi-Fiber Agreement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.\n\nThere are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) \u2014 negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] \u2014 with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].\n\n===Official corruption and foreign investment===\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, \"While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behavior by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister\u2019s government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.\"<ref>U.S. Embassy San Salvador, \"Reorganizing ARENA: The party's future after Avila's defeat,\" secret diplomatic cable, 6 October 2009, released by WikiLeaks, [http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 ID No. 09SANSALVADOR947] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603032809/http://cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 |date=2012-06-03 }}.</ref>\n\nSubsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]\" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>\n\nAs per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, \"Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most \"business friendly\" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labor force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>\n\nForeign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>[http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 \"CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje,\"] El Diario de Hoy (2012-05-21).</ref> The government came to its defense claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.\n\nSurfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.\n\nAccording to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Water supply and sanitation===\n{{Main article|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}\nThe level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly.

''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de ma\u00edz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>\n\n''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name=\"Elsalvador.com\"/>\n\nTwo other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].\n\nOne of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.\n\n[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.\n\n\"''Maria Luisa''\" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nA popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador \u2013 traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>\n\nOther popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavored carbonated beverage.\n\nOne of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Music of El Salvador}}\nSalvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments.

In the southeast, the [[Golfo de Fonseca]] separates it from [[Nicaragua]]. [[El Salvador]] is the smallest Central American country and is the only one without a [[coast]]line on the [[Caribbean sea]].\n\n== Plate tectonics ==\n\nEl Salvador, along with the rest of Central America, is one of the most seismologically active regions on earth, situated atop three of the large [[tectonics|tectonic]] plates that constitute the Earth's surface.  The motion of these plates causes the area's [[earthquake]] and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.\n\nMost of Central America and the [[Caribbean Basin]] rests on the relatively motionless [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Pacific Ocean floor, however, is being carried northeast by the underlying motion of the [[Cocos Plate]]. Ocean floor material is largely composed of [[basalt]], which is relatively dense; when it collides with the lighter [[granite]] rocks of Central America, the ocean floor is forced down under the land mass, creating the deep [[Middle America Trench]] that lies off the coast of El Salvador.\n\nThe subduction of the Cocos Plate accounts for the frequency of earthquakes near the coast. As the rocks constituting the ocean floor are forced down, they melt, and the molten material pours up through weaknesses in the surface rock, producing volcanoes and [[geyser]]s.\n\nNorth of El Salvador, Mexico and most of Guatemala are riding on the westward-moving [[North American Plate]] that butts against the northern edge of the stationary [[Caribbean Plate]] in southern Guatemala. The grinding action of these two plates creates a fault (similar to the [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas fault]] in California) that runs the length of the valley of the Rio Motagua in Guatemala. Motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in northernmost El Salvador.\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. [[San Salvador]] was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and  suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. The country has over twenty volcanoes, although only two, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], have been active in recent years. From the early nineteenth century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\n==Physical features==\n[[Image:El Salvador Topography.png|thumb|450px|El Salvador's topography.]]\n[[Image:El salvador econ 1980.jpg|thumb|450px|Economic activity of El Salvador, 1980.]]\n[[Image:El salvador land 1980.jpg|thumb|450px|Vegetation and land use, 1980.]]\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central [[plateau]] between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85 percent of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\nThe northern range of mountains, the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]], form a continuous chain along the border with Honduras. Elevations in this region range from 1,600 to 2,700 meters. The area was once heavily forested, but [[overexploitation]] led to extensive erosion, and it has become semibarren. As a result, it is the country's most sparsely populated zone, with little farming or other development.\n\nThe southern range of mountains is actually a discontinuous chain of more than twenty volcanoes, clustered into five groups. The westernmost group, near the Guatemalan border, contains [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] and Santa Ana, which at 2,365 meters is the highest volcano in El Salvador. Between the cones lie [[alluvial]] basins and rolling hills eroded from ash deposits. The volcanic soil is rich, and much of El Salvador's [[coffee]] is planted on these slopes.\n\nThe central plateau constitutes only 25 percent of the land area but contains the heaviest concentration of population and the country's largest cities. This plain is about 50 kilometers wide and has an average elevation of 600 meters. Terrain here is rolling, with occasional escarpments, [[lava]] fields, and [[geysers]].\n\nA narrow plain extends from the coastal volcanic range to the Pacific Ocean. This region has a width ranging from one to thirty-two kilometers with the widest section in the east, adjacent to the [[Golfo de Fonseca]]. Near [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], however, the mass of the mountains push the lowlands out; the slopes of adjacent volcanoes come down directly to the ocean. Surfaces in the Pacific lowlands are generally flat or gently rolling and result from the [[alluvial]] deposits of nearby slopes.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the [[Rio Lempa]]. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and finally cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river, it and its tributaries drain about half the country. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific.\n\nNumerous lakes of volcanic origin are found in the interior highlands; many of these lakes are surrounded by mountains and have high, steep banks. The largest lake, the [[Lago de Ilopango]], lies just to the east of the capital. Other large lakes include the [[Coatepeque Caldera|Lago de Coatepeque]] in the west and the [[Lake G\u00fcija|Lago de G\u00fcija]] on the Guatemalan border. The [[Cerr\u00f3n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Cerron Grande Dam]] on the Rio Lempa has created a large reservoir, the Embalse Cerron Grande, in northern El Salvador.\n\n[[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] has erupted at least 51 times since 1770. It earned the nickname \"Lighthouse of the Pacific\" because it was the most active volcano in Central America.\n\n==Climate==\nEl Salvador has a [[tropical]] climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate.\n\nThe rainy season, known locally as ''invierno'', or winter, extends from May to October. Almost all the annual rainfall and the highest humidity occurs during this time, and yearly rain totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. Protected areas and the central plateau receive lesser, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Although [[hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific, they seldom affect El Salvador, with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 (which actually formed over the Atlantic Basin) and [[1973 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Emily|Hurricane Emily]] in 1973.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy. This season is known locally as ''verano'', or summer.\n\nTemperatures vary little with season; elevation is the primary determinant. The Pacific lowlands are the hottest region, with annual averages ranging from {{convert|25|to|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. San Salvador is representative of the central plateau, with an annual average temperature of {{convert|23|\u00b0C}} and absolute high and low readings of {{convert|38|and|6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, respectively. Mountain areas are the coolest, with annual averages from {{convert|12|to|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and minimum temperatures sometimes approaching freezing.\n\n==Other facts==\nEl Salvador's physical shape form, evokes a similar resemblance to a rugged and miniature version of the U.S State of California. During the 1980s, the country's coastal roads were compared to California's coastal roads by American surfers and El Salvador became known as the wild west of Central America, characterized by roughness and lawlessness.\n\nThe total land area of El Salvador is 23,041&nbsp;km\u00b2, with 20,721&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and 320&nbsp;km\u00b2 of water. This is slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. El Salvador has 590&nbsp;km of borders, including 391&nbsp;km of borders with [[Honduras]] and 199&nbsp;km with [[Guatemala]]. El Salvador has a coastline of 307&nbsp;km.\n\nEl Salvador claims a [[territorial sea]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}}.\n\n'''Climate:'''\ntropical; rainy season (May to October); dry season (November to April); tropical on coast; temperate in uplands\n\n'''Terrain:'''\nmostly mountains with narrow coastal belt and central plateau\n\nThe lowest point of elevation in El Salvador is the [[Pacific Ocean]], at [[sea level]].

Many authors note that since ''La Matanza'' the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/central_america/el_salvador/history/military_rule_1931-1979.htm|title=Jose Napoleon Duarte,Hernandez Martinez,Ungo,Matanza,Central American Common Market,CACM,urban middle class,Christian Democratic Party,powerful families,death squads,Organization of American States,PRUD,International Court Of Justice,urban center,rapid population growth|website=Countriesquest.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include [[Sonsonate]] (especially [[Izalco]], [[Nahuizalco]], and [[Santo Domingo, Sonsonate|Santo Domingo]]), [[Cacaopera]], and [[Panchimalco]], in the department of [[San Salvador Department|San Salvador]].<ref name=\"El Salvador - Indigenous peoples\"/>\n\n===White Salvadorans===\n[[File:Salvadorianchildren.JPG|thumb|Salvadoran children]]\n[[File:Pedro de Alvarado.JPG|thumb|[[Spaniard]] conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and his army became the first to settle and establish European colonies in El Salvador in 1524.]]\n[[File:Spanish Conqueror.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] colonizers began settling in El Salvador and taking native wives, producing a high birth rate of mestizo children which make up today's modern Salvadoran population.]]\nSome 12% of Salvadorans are [[White Latin American|white]].

[[Afro-Salvadoran]]s are the descendants of the African population that were enslaved and shipped to El Salvador to work in mines in specific regions of El Salvador. They have mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. Thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have   English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations of the Caribbean, but instead had older colonial African slaves that came straight from Africa. This is the reason why El Salvador is the only country in Central America not to have a caribbeanized culture, and instead preserved its classical Central America culture.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n== The World Factbook demographic statistics ==\nThe following demographic statistics are from [[The World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated.<ref name=\"CIATONGA\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bb.html|title= Central America and Caribbean :: BARBADOS|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref>\n\n===Nationality===\n*Noun: Salvadoran(s) \n*Adjective: Salvadoran\n\n===Population===\n*6,161,125<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/|title=El Salvador Population (2017, 2018) - Worldometers|website=Worldometers.info|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\n*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] (official)\n*[[Nawat]] (among some Amerindians)\n\n===Literacy===\n*Total population: 88%\n*Male: 90.4%\n*Female: 86% (2015 est.)\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n*[[Mestizo]] 86.3%\n*[[White people|White]] 12.7%\n*[[Amerindians|Amerindian]] 0.2% (includes [[Lenca]], [[Kakawira]], [[Nahua-Pipil]])\n*[[Black people|Black]] 0.1%\n*Other 0.6%\n\n===Religions===\n{{Further|Religion in El Salvador}}\n*[[Roman Catholic]] 57.1%\n*[[Protestantism|Protestant]] 21.2%\n*[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] 1.9%\n*[[Mormon]] 0.7%\n*Other religions 2.3%\n*None 16.8%\n\n==Vital statistics==\n\n===UN estimates===\nThe Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.<ref name=\"WPP 2012\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n! width=\"50pt\"|Period\n! width=\"70pt\"|Live births<br />per year\n! width=\"70pt\"|Deaths<br />per year\n! width=\"70pt\"|Natural change<br />per year\n! width=\"35pt\"|CBR*\n! width=\"35pt\"|CDR*\n! width=\"35pt\"|NC*\n! width=\"35pt\"|TFR*\n! width=\"35pt\"|IMR*\n! width=\"50pt\"|Life expectancy <br />total\n! width=\"50pt\"|Life expectancy <br />males\n! width=\"50pt\"|Life expectancy <br />females\n|-\n| 1950-1955 || 108 000|| 48 000|| 61 000||46.7||20.6||26.1||6.30||147||45.1||43.4||46.8\n|-\n| 1955-1960 || 125 000|| 46 000|| 78 000||47.8||17.8||30.0||6.60||132||49.3||47.2||51.5\n|-\n| 1960-1965 || 144 000|| 47 000|| 97 000||47.7||15.5||32.3||6.76||119||53.0||50.5||55.7\n|-\n| 1965-1970 || 156 000|| 47 000|| 109 000||44.8||13.5||31.3||6.43||109||55.6||52.6||58.9\n|-\n| 1970-1975 || 168 000|| 49 000|| 119 000||42.1||12.3||29.8||5.95||100||57.0||53.2||61.2\n|-\n| 1975-1980 || 177 000|| 52 000|| 124 000||39.7||11.8||27.9||5.46||91||57.0||51.9||62.7\n|-\n| 1980-1985 || 174 000|| 55 000|| 119 000||36.1||11.4||24.7||4.80||77||56.9||50.6||64.2\n|-\n| 1985-1990 || 171 000|| 44 000|| 126 000||33.0||8.6||24.4||4.20||56||63.1||57.4||69.1\n|-\n| 1990-1995 || 169 000|| 37 000|| 132 000||30.5||6.8||23.8||3.73||38||68.0||63.3||72.9\n|-\n| 1995-2000 || 161 000|| 38 000|| 123 000||27.5||6.6||20.9||3.30||27||69.2||64.4||73.9\n|-\n| 2000-2005 || 133 000|| 75 000|| 94 000||22.0||6.4||15.6||2.60||23||70.2||65.4||74.9\n|-\n| 2005-2010 || 127 000|| 90 000|| 87 000||20.7||6.5||14.2||2.35||21||71.3||66.5||75.9\n|-\n|align=\"left\" colspan=12 | * {{small|1=CBR = crude birth rate (per 1000); CDR = crude death rate (per 1000); NC = natural change (per 1000); IMR = infant mortality rate per 1000 births; TFR = total fertility rate (number of children per woman)}}\n|}\n\n===Registered data===\n[[File:US Navy 090628-N-6259S-001 Capt.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.\n\n[[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated El Salvador as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n== Political culture ==\n{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador|Elections in El Salvador}}\n\nEl Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009.\n\nGeographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of El Salvador|President]]\n|[[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]]\n|[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]]\n|1 June 2014\n|}\n[[El Salvador]] elects its [[head of state]] &ndash; the [[President of El Salvador]] &ndash;  directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority.  If an absolute majority (50% + 1) is not achieved by any candidate in the first round of a presidential election, then a run-off pool election is conducted 30 days later between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round.  The presidential period is five years. Consecutive re-election is not permitted, though previously elected presidents may run for a second, non-consecutive term.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Legislative Assembly of El Salvador}}\nSalvadorans also elect a single-chamber, unicameral national [[legislature]] &ndash; the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]] &ndash; of 84 members (deputies) elected by closed-list proportional representation for three-year terms, with the possibility of immediate re-election. Twenty of the 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of a single national [[constituency]].  The remaining 64 are elected in 14 multi-member [[constituencies]] (corresponding to [[Departments of El Salvador|El Salvador's 14 departments]]). They range from 3-16 seats each according to department population size.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{main|Court system of El Salvador}}\nThe Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{Further|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}\n\nEl Salvador is a member of the [[United Nations]] and several of its specialized agencies, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM), the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN), and the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA). It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission (CASC), which seeks to promote regional arms control.\n\nEl Salvador also is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] and is pursuing regional free trade agreements. An active participant in the [[Summit of the Americas]] process, El Salvador chairs a [[working group]] on market access under the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] initiative.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/ Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150415055703/http://www.presidencia.gob.sv/ Presidency of El Salvador]\n*[http://www.csj.gob.sv/ Supreme Court of Justice of El Salvador]\n*[http://tyglobalist.org/index.php/20090511201/Features/Changing-Colors-in-El-Salvador.html Changing Colors in El Salvador]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Emma Vawter, ''The Yale Globalist'', May 11, 2009\n\n{{El Salvador topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of El Salvador|*]]", "sha1": "l3q7ij51766dih9b1gyya3mjjul6kbu"}}, {"title": "Economy of El Salvador", "ns": "0", "id": "9361", "revision": {"id": "862725753", "parentid": "859131025", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T08:10:33Z", "contributor": {"ip": "190.57.11.0"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = El Salvador\n|image           =\n|gdp             = ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]){{increase}}$57.28 billion (2017 est.)

This way, the government has formally limited its possibility of implementing open market monetary policies to influence short term variables in the economy.  Since 2004, the col\u00f3n stopped circulating and is now never used in the country for any type of transaction; however some stores still have prices in both colons and U.S. dollars.  In general, people were unhappy with the shift from the col\u00f3n to the U.S. dollar, because wages are still the same but the price of everything increased. Some economists claim this rise in prices would have been caused by inflation regardless even had the shift not been made. Some economists also contend that now, according to [[Gresham's Law]], a reversion to the col\u00f3n would be disastrous to the economy.\n\nSome banks however claim that they still do some transactions ''en colones,'' keeping this change from being unconstitutional.\n\nThe change to the dollar also precipitated a trend toward lower interest rates in El Salvador, helping many to secure credit in order to buy a house or a car; over time, displeasure with the change has largely disappeared, though the issue resurfaces as a political tool when elections are on the horizon.\n\n== Public sector ==\n[[Fiscal policy]] has been one of the biggest challenges for the Salvadoran government. The 1992 peace accords committed the government to heavy expenditures for transition programs and social services. The stability adjustment programs (PAE, for the initials in Spanish) initiated by President Cristiani's administration committed the government to the privatization of banks, the pension system, electric and telephone companies. The total privatization of the pension system has implied a serious burden for the public finances, because the newly created private Pension Association Funds did not absorb coverage of retired pensioners covered in the old system. As a result, in July 2017, the Government of El Salvador wanted to take $500 millions from the privatized pension system to cover retired pensioners from the old not privatized system, but the Supreme Court of El Salvador declared this move unconstitutional<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2017/07/27/sala-anula-reforma-de-pensiones|title=SALA ANULA REFORMA DE PENSIONES|last=Garc\u00eda|first=Gabriel|date=27 July 2017|work=La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica|access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref>.\n\nThe government lost the revenues from contributors and absorbed completely the costs of coverage of retired pensioners. This has been the main source of fiscal imbalance.  ARENA governments have financed this deficit with the emission of bonds, something the leftist party FMLN has opposed.  Debates surrounding the emission of bonds have stalled the approval of the national budget for many months on several occasions, reason for which in 2006 the government will finance the deficit by reducing expenditure in other posts. The emission of bonds and the approval of a loans need a qualified majority (3/4 of the votes) in the parliament. If the deficit is not financed through a loan it is enough with a simple majority to approve the budget (50% of the votes plus 1). This would facilitate an otherwise long process in Salvadoran politics.\n\nDespite such challenges to keep public finances in balance, El Salvador still has one of the lowest tax burdens in the American continent (around 11% of GDP). Many specialists{{Who|date=May 2014}} claim that it is impossible to advance significant development programs with such a little public sector (the tax burden in the United States is around 25% of the GDP and in other developed countries of the EU it can reach around 50%, like in Sweden). The government has focused on improving the collection of its current [[revenue]]s with a focus on indirect taxes. Leftist politicians criticize such a structure since indirect taxes (like the value added tax) affect everyone alike, whereas direct taxes can be weighed according to levels of income and are therefore fairer taxes.  However, some basic goods are exempt from the indirect taxes.  A 10% [[value-added tax]] (VAT), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995. The VAT is the biggest source of revenue, accounting for about 52.3% of total tax revenues in 2004.\n\n== Economic sectors ==\n\n=== Remittances ===\nRemittances from Salvadorans working in the United States sent to family members are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of around $2.9 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade and reached an all-time high of $2.9 billion in 2005\u2014approximately 17.1% of gross national product ([[Gross national product|GNP]]). As of April 2004, net [[international reserve system|international reserves]] stood at $1.9 billion.\n\nIn recent years inflation has fallen to single digit levels, and total exports have grown substantially.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Cotton-UsulutanSV.jpg|thumb|250px|A cotton field, Usulut\u00e1n Department.]]\n\nThe ultimate goal was to develop a rural middle class with a stake in a peaceful and prosperous future for El Salvador. At least 525,000 people\u2014more than 12% of El Salvador's population at the time and perhaps 25% of the rural poor\u2014benefited from agrarian reform, and more than 22% of El Salvador's total farmland was transferred to those who previously worked the land but did not own it. But when agrarian reform ended in 1990, about 150,000 landless families still had not benefited from the reform actions.\n\nThe 1992 peace accords made provisions for land transfers to all qualified ex-combatants of both the [[FMLN]] and [[ESAF]], as well as to landless peasants living in former conflict areas. The United States undertook to provide $300 million for a national reconstruction plan. This included $60 million for land purchases and $17 million for agricultural credits. USAID remains actively involved in providing technical training, access to credit, and other financial services for many of the land beneficiaries.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nEl Salvador historically has been the most industrialized nation in Central America, though a decade of war eroded this position. In 1999, manufacturing accounted for 22% of GDP. The industrial sector has shifted since 1993 from a primarily domestic orientation to include free zone ([[maquiladora]]) manufacturing for export. Maquila exports have led the growth in the export sector and in the last 3 years have made an important contribution to the Salvadoran economy.\n\n===Services===\nIn the 21st century, numerous [[call center]]s serving North American markets have been developed in El Salvador. The industry benefits from the availability of a large English speaking work force, composed of deportees from the United States.<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/23/the-deportees-taking-our-calls \n|title=The deportess taking our calls: How American immigration policy has fuelled an unlikely industry in El Salvador.\n|date=2017-01-23|first=Jonathan|last=Blitzer|journal=The New Yorker}}</ref>\n\n==Trade==\n[[File:El Salvador Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of El Salvador's exports.]]\n\nA challenge in El Salvador has been developing new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. As many other former colonies, for many years El Salvador was considered a monoexporter economy. This means, an economy that depended heavily on one type of export. During colonial times, the Spanish decided that El Salvador would produce and export [[indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, Salvadoran authorities and the newly created modern state turned to coffee as the main export of the economy.\n\nSince the cultivation of coffee required the highest lands in the country, many of these lands were expropriated from indigenous reserves and given or sold cheaply to those that could cultivate coffee. The government provided little or no compensation to the indigenous peoples. On occasions this compensation implied merely the right to work for seasons in the newly created coffee farms and to be allowed to grow their own food. Such policies provided the basis of conflicts that would shape the political situation of El Salvador in the years to come.\n\nARENA governments have followed policies that intend to develop other exporting industries in the country as textiles and sea products. Tourism is another industry Salvadoran authorities regard as a possibility for the country. But rampant crime rates, lack of infrastructure and inadequate social capital have prevented these possibilities from being properly exploited. The government is also developing ports and infrastructure in [[La Uni\u00f3n, El Salvador|La Uni\u00f3n]] in the east of the country, in order to use the area as a \"dry canal\" for transporting goods from [[Gulf of Fonseca]] in the Pacific Ocean to [[Honduras]] and the Atlantic Ocean in the north. Currently there are fifteen [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. The largest beneficiary has been the [[maquila]] industry, which provides 88,700 jobs directly, and consists primarily of cutting and assembling clothes for export to the United States.\n\nEl Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic, with the United States in 2004. In order to take advantage of CAFTA-DR, the Salvadoran government is challenged to conduct policies that guarantee better conditions for entrepreneurs and workers to transfer from declining to growing sectors in the economy. El Salvador has already signed free trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, and increased its exports to those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada, and negotiations started on 2006 for a free trade agreement with Colombia.\n\nEl Salvador's [[balance of payments]] continued to show a net surplus. Exports in 1999 grew 1.9% while imports grew 3%, narrowing El Salvador's trade deficit. As in the previous year, the large trade deficit was offset by foreign aid and [[family remittance]]s. Remittances are increasing at an annual rate of 6.5%, and an estimated $1.35 billion will enter the national economy during 1999.\n\nPrivate foreign capital continued to flow in, though mostly as short-term import financing and not at the levels of previous years. The Central American Common Market continued its dynamic reactivation process, now with most regional commerce duty-free. In September 1996, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras opened free trade talks with Mexico. This trade alliance is also known as the Northern Triangle in relation to the Central American economies that are grouped together by proximity and location.[http://www.sice.oas.org/ctyindex/SLV/SLVagreements_e.asp]   Although tariff cuts that were expected in July 1996 were delayed until 1997, the government of El Salvador is committed to a free and open economy.\n\nTotal U.S. exports to El Salvador reached $2.1 billion in 1999, while El Salvador exported $1.6 billion to the United States. U.S. support for El Salvador's privatization of the electrical and telecommunications markets has markedly expanded opportunities for U.S. investment in the country. More than 300 U.S. companies have established either a permanent commercial presence in El Salvador or work through representative offices in the country. The Department of State maintains a country commercial guide for U.S. businesses seeking detailed information on business opportunities in El Salvador.\n\n==Natural disasters: Hurricane Mitch (1998) and the earthquakes (2001)==\n[[Hurricane Mitch]] hit El Salvador in late October 1998, generating extreme rainfall of which caused widespread flooding and landslides. Roughly 650&nbsp;km\u00b2 were flooded, and the Salvadoran Government pronounced 374 people dead or missing. In addition, approximately 55,900 people were rendered homeless. The areas that suffered the most were the low-lying coastal zones, particularly in the floodplain of the [[Lempa River|Lempa]] and [[San Miguel Grande River]]s. Three major bridges that cross the Lempa were swept away, restricting access to the eastern third of the country and forcing the emergency evacuation of many communities. The heavy rainfall, flooding, and mudslides caused by Hurricane Mitch also severely damaged El Salvador's road network. Along with the three major bridges over the Lempa River, 12 other bridges were damaged or destroyed by the Mitch flooding.\n\nThe largest single-affected sector was El Salvador's agriculture. Nearly 18% of the total 1998\u201399 basic [[cereal|grain]] harvest was lost. Coffee production was hit particularly hard; 3% of the harvest was lost in addition to 8.2% that was lost earlier in the year due to El Ni\u00f1o. Major losses of sugarcane, totaling 9% of the estimated 1998\u201399 production, were sustained primarily in the coastal regions. Livestock losses amounted to $1 million, including 2,992 head of cattle. In addition to these losses, El Salvador also had to face the threat of disease outbreak. The Ministry of Health recorded a total of 109,038 medical cases related to Hurricane Mitch between 31 October and 18 November 1998; 23% of these cases were respiratory infections, followed by skin ailments, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis.\n\nReconstruction from Mitch was still underway when, in early 2001, the country experienced a series of devastating earthquakes that left nearly 2,000 people dead or missing, 8,000 injured, and caused severe dislocations across all sectors of Salvadoran society. Nearly 25% of all private homes in the country were either destroyed or badly damaged, and 1.5 million persons were left without housing. Hundreds of public buildings were damaged or destroyed, and sanitation and water systems in many communities put out service. The total cost of the damage was estimated at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, and the devastation thought to equal or surpass that of the 1986 quake that struck [[San Salvador, El Salvador|San Salvador]]. Given the magnitude of the disaster, reconstruction and economic recovery will remain the primary focus of the Salvadoran Government for some time to come.\n\nThe Hurricane Mitch disaster prompted a tremendous response from the international community governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and private citizens alike. Sixteen foreign governments\u2014including the U.S., 19 international NGOs, 20 Salvadoran embassies and consulates, and 20 private firms and individuals provided El Salvador with in-kind assistance. The Government of El Salvador reports that 961 tons of goods and food were received. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that contribution in cash given directly to the Salvadoran Government totaled $4.3 million. The U.S. Government has provided $37.7 million in assistance through USAID and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Defense.\n\nFollowing the 2001 earthquakes, the U.S. embassy assumed a leading role in implementing U.S.-sponsored assistance. The U.S. Government responded immediately to the emergency, with military helicopters active in initial rescue operations, delivering emergency supplies, rescue workers, and damage assessment teams to stricken communities all over the country. [[USAID]]s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance had a team of experts working with Salvadoran relief authorities immediately after both quakes, and provided assistance totaling more than $14 million. In addition, the Department of Defense provided an initial response valued at more than $11 million. For long-term reconstruction, the international community offered a total aid package of $1.3 billion, over $110 million of it from the United States.\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=253&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=19&pr.y=18|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-08-28|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|10.10 Bln.\n|11.91 Bln.\n|15.39 Bln.\n|23.42 Bln.\n|29.60 Bln.\n|37.34 Bln.\n|40.00 Bln.\n|42.63 Bln.\n|44.03 Bln.\n|42.97 Bln.\n|44.09 Bln.\n|46.00 Bln.\n|47.73 Bln.\n|49.39 Bln.\n|51.00 Bln.\n|52.73 Bln.\n|54.67 Bln.\n|57.00 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|2,143\n|2,431\n|2,930\n|4,175\n|5,042\n|6,193\n|6,600\n|7,013\n|7,206\n|6,999\n|7,158\n|7,431\n|7,673\n|7,903\n|8,120\n|8,357\n|8,623\n|8,948\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|\u22128.6 %\n|0.6 %\n|4.8 %\n|6.4 %\n|2.2 %\n|3.6 %\n|3.9 %\n|3.8 %\n|1.3 %\n|\u22123.1 %\n|1.4 %\n|2.2 %\n|1.9 %\n|1.8 %\n|1.4 %\n|2.3 %\n|2.4 %\n|2.4 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|17.4 %\n|22.3 %\n|28.3 %\n|10.0 %\n|2.3 %\n|4.7 %\n|4.0 %\n|4.6 %\n|7.3 %\n|0.5 %\n|1.2 %\n|5.1 %\n|1.7 %\n|0.8 %\n|1.1 %\n|\u22120.7 %\n|0.6 %\n|1.0 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|26 %\n|27 %\n|39 %\n|39 %\n|38 %\n|39 %\n|48 %\n|50 %\n|50 %\n|55 %\n|55 %\n|57 %\n|58 %\n|59 %\n|59 %\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coffee production in El Salvador]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/Country/SLV/Year/2012/Summary World Bank Summary Trade Statistics El Salvador]\n*Tariffs applied by El Salvador as provided by ITC's [http://www.macmap.org/QuickSearch/FindTariff/FindTariff.aspx?subsite=open_access&country=222&source=1|ITC'''Market Access Map'''], an online database of customs tariffs and market requirements.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080117083259/http://www.proesa.com.sv/appareltextiles.html Apparel and Textiles] Retrieved 2008-03-30\n\n{{El Salvador topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Economy of}}\n\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Economy of El Salvador| ]]", "sha1": "j3wc5l5463s3z0chlrg3xz9b07b7v3k"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in El Salvador", "ns": "0", "id": "9362", "revision": {"id": "863598719", "parentid": "845984992", "timestamp": "2018-10-11T20:05:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:GenFixes]] on, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: o\u2019s \u2192 o's", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Telecommunications in [[El Salvador]]''' include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet,  centered primarily around the capital, [[San Salvador]].\n\n== Radio and television ==\n{{See also |List of television stations in Latin America#El Salvador |l1=List of television stations in El Salvador}}\n\n* [[Radio broadcasting|Radio stations]]: Hundreds of commercial radio broadcast stations and 1 government-owned radio broadcast station (2007).<ref name=CIAWFB-ElSalvaror-2014>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/es.html \"Communications: El Salvador\"], ''World Factbook'', U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 7 January 2014.

They saw the generals clinging to senior posts for which they had little training and without making way for the younger officers. They saw the generals failing to prepare for the social and economic changes coming to Central America. They objected to unfair disciplinary measures and unfair surveillance. In 1948, fighting broke out between the younger officers and troops under their command and the senior generals and the police force under their command. The president, [[Salvador Castaneda Castro]] (1888 {{ndash}} 1965) was imprisoned. Senior officers and politicians were dismissed.

There was dispute concerning the border between the two countries. Approximately 300,000 Salvadorans had moved to Honduras due to population and land pressures in their homeland but Honduras had not renewed the El Salvador - Honduras Bilateral Treaty on Immigration. Honduras and El Salvador were competitors in the Central American Common Market. Honduras' economy was struggling and the Honduran Government started to deport the Salvadorans who they saw as illegal immigrants. Many Salvadorans fled after their Vice Consul was killed.<ref>Di Piazza F.

[[Bantu people|Bantu]] migrations between the 18th and 19th centuries brought coastal ethno-linguistic groups as well as the [[Fang people]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who migrated from Cameroon to R\u00edo Muni and Bioko in several waves and succeeded former [[Neolithic]] populations. The [[Annobonese Creole|Annob\u00f3n]] population, originally native to [[Angola]], was introduced by the Portuguese via [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 island]].\n\n===First European contact (1472)===\nThe [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese explorer]] [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3|Fernando P\u00f3]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]] and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded [[Bioko]], adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain thereby tried to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nFrom 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to control the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was moved to [[Sierra Leone]] under an agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, the area became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea.\" Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the French had busily expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental [[enclave]] of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed.<ref name=Clarence-Smith>Clarence-Smith, William Gervase (1986) [http://es.scribd.com/doc/63545279/The-Cambridge-History-of-Africa-Volume-7-From-1905-to-1940-0521225051-1986 \"Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898\u20131940\"] in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The British occupied the island briefly in the early 19th century, settling some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves there. Limited immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the British left. To this were added Cubans, Filipinos and Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, as well as some assisted settlers.\n\nThere was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[Windward coast]] continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange a supply of labor.\n\nThe opening years of the twentieth century saw a new generation of Spanish immigrants. Land regulations issued in 1904\u20131905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from Spain after that. The Liberian labor agreement of 1914{{clarify|date=November 2017}} favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labor supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, an estimated 20% of the colony's cocoa production came from African-owned land, nearly all of it was in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\n[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]], 1910]]\nThe greatest constraint to [[economic development]] was a chronic shortage of labour.  Pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, [[smallpox]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], the indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]] refused to work on [[plantation]]s. Working their own small [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[Paraguay]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique|title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3's Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=57|pages=39\u201372|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417|year=2012}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930.\n\nWith Liberian workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14636204.2013.790703|title=La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: Antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Also, the [[timber]] companies needed increasing numbers of workers, and the spread of [[coffee]] cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes{{clarify|date=November 2016}}. Fernando P\u00f3 thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[Nigeria]]. This resolution to the worker shortage allowed Fernando P\u00f3 to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nPolitically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colonial' to 'provincial', following the approach of the [[Portuguese Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of\nthe Spanish system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. (1984)\n ''The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975''.\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n{{ISBN|0521224098}}.</ref>\n\nThis 'provincial' phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea]] (MONALIGE), and the {{ILL|Idea Popular de la Guinea Ecuatorial|es}} (IPGE). The pressure they could bring to bear was weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not.\n\nA decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{ILL|Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid gave way to the currents of nationalism.\n\n===Independence (1968)===\nIndependence was conceded on 12 October 1968 and the region became the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] was elected president.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Campos, Alicia|title=The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor|journal=Journal of African History|year=2003|pages=95\u2013116|volume=44|issue=1|url=http://www.egjustice.org/publications/decolonization-equatorial-guinea-relevance-international-factor|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1970, Macias Nguema created a [[one-party state|single-party state]] and made himself [[president for life]] in 1972.

In spite of his condemnation of [[Marxism]], which he deemed \"neo-colonialist\", Equatorial Guinea maintained very special relations with socialist countries, notably [[China]], [[Cuba]], and the [[USSR]]. He signed a preferential [[trade agreement]] and a shipping treaty with the Soviet Union.

The vote on the constitution was taken though neither the text or its content was revealed to the public before the vote. Under the new constitution the president was limited to a maximum of two seven-year terms and would be both the head of state and head of the government, therefore eliminating the prime minister. The new constitution also introduced the figure of a vice president and called for the creation of a 70-member senate with 55 senators elected by the people and the 15 remaining designated by the president. Surprisingly, in the following cabinet reshuffle it was announced that there would be two vice-presidents in clear violation of the constitution that was just taking effect.<ref>[http://www.guineaecuatorialpress.com/noticia.php?id=2668&lang=en Ignacio Milam Tang, new Vice President of the Nation]. guineaecuatorialpress.com. 22 May 2012.</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, during an interview with [[Christiane Amanpour]] on [[CNN]], Obiang was asked whether he would step down at the end of the current term (2009\u20132016) since the new constitution limited the number of terms to two and he has been reelected at least 4 times. Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two- term limit would only become applicable from 2016.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1210/05/ampr.01.html Interview with President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea].

Like all previous elections, this was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party hosted internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates led the internal lists. Ultimately, the ruling party and the satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.\n\nThe May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and official state media portrayed him as planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Nsolo said that they had planned a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a [[censorship]] program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea. The censorship was implemented by redirecting online searches to the official government website.\n\nShortly after the elections, opposition party CPDS announced that they were going to protest peacefully against the 26 May elections on 25 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221031810/http://www.cpds-gq.org/attachments/article/269/Comunicado_convocatoria_manifestacion.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-21|title=Convocatorial de Manifestacion, 25 de Junio 2013|work=cpds-gq.org}}</ref> Interior minister Clemente Engonga refused to authorize the protest on the grounds that it could \"destabilize\" the country and CPDS decided to go forward, claiming constitutional right. On the night of 24 June, the CPDS headquarters in Malabo were surrounded by heavily armed police officers to keep those inside from leaving and thus effectively blocking the protest. Several leading members of CPDS were detained in Malabo and others in Bata were kept from boarding several local flights to Malabo.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Equatorial Guinea}}\nEquatorial Guinea is in west central Africa. The country consists of a mainland territory, [[R\u00edo Muni]], which is bordered by Cameroon to the north and Gabon to the east and south, and five small islands, [[Bioko]], [[Corisco]], [[Annob\u00f3n]], [[Elobey Chico]] (Small Elobey), and [[Elobey Grande]] (Great Elobey). Bioko, the site of the capital, Malabo, lies about {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} off the coast of Cameroon. Annob\u00f3n Island is about {{convert|350|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of [[Cape Lopez]] in Gabon. Corisco and the two Elobey islands are in Corisco Bay, on the border of R\u00edo Muni and Gabon.\n\nEquatorial Guinea lies between latitudes [[4th parallel north|4\u00b0N]] and [[2nd parallel south|2\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[5th meridian west|5\u00b0]] and [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0E]]. Despite its name, no part of the country's territory lies on the equator\u2014it is in the northern hemisphere, except for the insular [[Annob\u00f3n Province]], which is about {{convert|155|km|abbr=on}} south of the equator.\n\n===Climate===\nEquatorial Guinea has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. From June to August, R\u00edo Muni is dry and Bioko wet; from December to February, the reverse occurs. In between there is gradual transition. Rain or mist occurs daily on Annob\u00f3n, where a cloudless day has never been registered. The temperature at Malabo, Bioko, ranges from {{convert|16|C}} to {{convert|33|C}}, though on the southern [[Moka Plateau]] normal high temperatures are only {{convert|21|C}}. In R\u00edo Muni, the average temperature is about {{convert|27|C}}. Annual [[rainfall]] varied from {{convert|1930|mm|abbr=on}} at Malabo to {{convert|10920|mm|abbr=on}} at [[San Antonio de Ureca|Ureka]], Bioko, but R\u00edo Muni is somewhat drier.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Equatorial-Guinea-CLIMATE.html Nations Encyclopedia].

[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal groups and later the [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]]. Elements of the latter may have generated the [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who emigrated to Bioko from Cameroon and R\u00edo Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of [[Nigeria]] (mostly [[Aro people|Aro]]) slave traders arrived and founded small settlements in Bioko and Rio Muni which expanded the [[Aro Confederacy]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Annob\u00f3n population, originally from [[Angola]], were brought by the Portuguese via [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]].\n\n==Colonial era==\n\n===Spanish and British empires===\n\nThe [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorer [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando P\u00f3 and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by Portugal in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded the Bioko, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the Bight of Biafra between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain intended to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nFrom 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to combat the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was then moved to [[Sierra Leone]] upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea\". Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights, and the French had been expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental enclave of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had claimed \n.<ref name=Clarence-Smith>William Gervase Clarence-Smith, 1986 \"Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898-1940\", in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The British had settled some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves during their brief occupation of the island in the early 19th century, and a small current of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the departure of the British. To this core of settlers were added Cubans, Filipinos, Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, and some assisted settlers. There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands: escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the Fernandinos were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the lingua franca of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labour recruitment on the Windward coast continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange labour supplies.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], due to Spain's neutrality Rio Muni and Fernando Po were host to large numbers of German troops and refugees who fled [[German Kamerun]] after the [[Kamerun Campaign|Entente conquered the colony]]. They were well-treated by the Spanish authorities, largely because the 180-man militia was not large enough to forcibly intern them. Most of the Cameroonian natives stayed in Muni, while the Germans moved to Fernando Po.\n\nFrom the opening years of the 20th century, the Fernandinos were put on the defensive by a new generation of Spanish immigrants. New land regulations in 1904-5 favoured Spaniards, and most of the big planters of later years arrived in the islands from Spain following these new regulations. The Liberian labour agreement of 1914 favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labour supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, it was estimated that only 20 per cent of the colony's cocoa production remained in African hands, nearly all of it in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\nThe greatest constraint to economic development was a chronic shortage of labour. The indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]], pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcoholic addiction, venereal disease, smallpox and sleeping sickness, refused to work on plantations. Working their own little cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters from the late 19th century by the Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit [[Reducciones|Reductions]] of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections protesting the conscription of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations, in 1898 and 1910, which led to the Bubi being disarmed in 1917 and left them dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Spanish, Portuguese, German and Fernandino planters started developing large [[cacao plantation]]s.<ref>Clarence-Smith, William G. \"African and European Cocoa Producers on Fernando Poo, 1880s to 1910s.\" Journal of African History 35 (1994): 179-179.</ref> With the indigenous Bubi population decimated by disease and forced labour, the island\u2019s economy came to depend on imported agricultural contract workers. A Labour Treaty was signed with the Republic of [[Liberia]] in 1914, the transport of up to 15,000 workers was orchestrated by the German [[Woermann-Linie]].<ref>Sundiata, Ibrahim K.

The economy was based on large [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant contract labour from Liberia, [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\"/> Military campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>Ner\u00edn, Gustau. \"La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Catarata, 2010.</ref> However, Rio Muni had a small population, officially put at a little over 100,000 in the 1930s, and escape over the frontiers into Cameroun or Gabon was very easy. Moreover, the timber companies needed growing amounts of labour, and the spread of coffee cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes. Fernando Po thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The French only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] and [[Oron, Nigeria]]. The persisting labour shortage in the cacao, coffee and logging industries was only overcome by the mushrooming illegal canoe-based smuggling of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] workers from the Eastern Provinces of Nigeria. The number of clandestine contract workers on the island of Fernando Po grew to 20,000 in 1942.<ref name=\"opensourceguinea.org\">Enrique Martino \"Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3\u2019s Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945.\" International Review of Social History, 57, pp 39-72. http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html</ref> A labour treaty was signed in the same year, and a continuous stream of workers arrived in Spanish Guinea. It was this treaty which really permitted Fernando Po to become one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the Second World War.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" /> By 1968 there were almost 100,000 Nigerians in Spanish Guinea.<ref>P\u00e9lissier, Ren\u00e9. Los Territorios Espanoles De Africa. Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, 1964.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War, 1936\u20131939===\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] the colony remained loyal to the Republican government. On July 24, 1936, the Republican cruiser ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' arrived at [[Malabo|Santa Isabel]]; on its way back to Spain the officers planned to join the rebellion, but the Spanish government, knowing this, ordered the ship to go back to the colony; on August 14 the ''M\u00e9ndez N\u00fa\u00f1ez'' was back in [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], where the sailors took control of her; on September 21 the ship arrived in M\u00e1laga (Republican Spain). On September 19 the Colonial Guard and the Civil Guard began the rebellion and took control of the island of Fernando Po, while the rest of the colony remained loyal to the Republic. On September 22 a clash took place between a rebel group from [[Cogo, Equatorial Guinea|Kogo]] and a loyal detachment from [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]. Finally, on October 14 a force of 200 rebels arrived in the merchant ''Ciudad de Mah\u00f3n'' and took control of Bata and the rest of the colony.\n\n===Provincialisation and decolonisation===\n\nThe post-war political history of the colony can be divided into three fairly distinct phases: \n#up to 1959, when its status was raised from 'colony' to 'province', taking a leaf out of the approach of the Portuguese Empire; \n#between 1960 and 1968, when Spain attempted a partial decolonisation which was hoped would conserve the territory as an integral segment of the Spanish system; and \n#after 1968, when the territory became an independent republic.\n\nThe first of these phases consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''emancipados'', assimilation to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed. The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8, from C. 1940 to C. 1975. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.</ref> The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the [[Cortes Generales]] (Spanish parliament). Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. A paradoxical effect of this autonomy was that Guineans could choose among several political parties while metropolitan Spaniards were under a single-party regime. The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea. Although Spain's commissioner general had extensive powers, the Equatorial Guinean General Assembly had considerable initiative in formulating laws and regulations.\n\nNationalism began to emerge during this \"provincial\" phase, chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from General Franco's paternal hand in Cameroun and Gabon. They formed two bodies: the Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de la Guinea ([[MONALIGE]]), and the Idea Popular de la Guinea Ecuatorial ([[IPGE]]). Their pressures were weak, but the general trend in West Africa was not. A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, introduced the territory to a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' grouping, the Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional de la Guinea Ecuatorial ([[MUNGE]]). This proved a feeble instrument, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Spain gave way to the currents of nationalism. Independence was conceded on 12 October 1968 and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea came into being with [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] elected as president.<ref>Campos, Alicia. \"The decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: the relevance of the international factor.\" Journal of African history (2003): 95-116.</ref>\n\n==Independence==\nIn March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the [[United Nations]], Spain announced that it would grant independence to Equatorial Guinea. A constitutional convention produced an electoral law and draft constitution. In the presence of a UN observer team, a referendum was held on August 11, 1968, and 63% of the electorate voted in favour of the constitution, which provided for a government with a General Assembly and a Supreme Court with judges appointed by the president.\n\nIn September 1968, [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] was elected first president of Equatorial Guinea, and independence was granted in October.\n\nAt independence, Equatorial Guinea had one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa, although it was also very unevenly distributed as most of the money was in the hands of colonial and elite planters.<ref name=\"Lacosta\"/> In its final years of rule the Spanish colonial government achieved a relatively high literacy rates and developed a good network of health care facilities. However at the time of independence, the number of African doctors and lawyers was in the single digits.<ref name=\"Lacosta\">''Ndongo-Bidyogo, Donato. Historia y tragedia de Guinea Ecuatorial. 1977.''</ref>\n\nIn July 1970, Macias created a single-party state and by May 1971, key portions of the constitution were abrogated. In 1972 Macias took complete control of the government and assumed the title of [[President for Life]]. The Macias regime was characterized by abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; this led to the death or exile of up to one-third of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Due to pilferage, ignorance, and neglect, the country's infrastructure\u2014electrical, water, road, transportation, and health\u2014fell into ruin. The private and public sectors of the economy were devastated. Nigerian contract labourers on Bioko, estimated to have been 60,000, left en masse in early 1976. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.\n\nReligion was repressed, and education ceased. All schools were ordered closed in 1975, and the country's churches were also closed in 1978. Nguema introduced a campaign of 'authenticity', replacing colonial names with native ones: the capital Santa Isabel became [[Malabo]], the main island of [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]] was renamed Masie Nguema Biyogo after himself, and [[Annob\u00f3n]] became [[Pagalu]]. As part of the same process, Nguema also ordered the entire population to drop their European names and adopt African ones. His own name underwent several transformations, so that by the end of his rule he was known as Masie Nguema Biyogo \u00d1egue Ndong. Many of the island residents population consisting of Nigerian labourers and traders were forced to evacuate.<ref>Aworawo, David. \"Decisive Thaw: The Changing Pattern of Relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, 1980-2005.\" Journal of International and Global Studies 1 (2010): 89-109.</ref>\n\nIn August 1979 Macias' nephew from Mongomo and former director of the infamous [[Black Beach]] prison, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], led a successful coup d'\u00e9tat; Macias was arrested, tried, and executed. Obiang assumed the presidency in October 1979. The islands were renamed [[Bioko]] and Annob\u00f3n. The new ruler faced the challenge of restoring order in a country that was in shambles\u2014by the end of Masie Nguema's dictatorship, the state coffers were empty and the population had been reduced to only one-third of what it was at independence.\n\n==1990s\u20132000s==\n{{main|2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt}}\n\nAlthough President Obiang signed a national anti-torture decree in 2006 to ban all forms of abuse and improper treatment in Equatorial Guinea and commissioned the renovation and modernization of Black Beach prison in 2007 to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners,<ref>[http://www.mpri.com/esite/index.php/content/services/organizational_reform_amp_institutional_capacity_building/] MPRI</ref> human rights abuses continue.

[[Bioko|Bioko Island]] lies about {{convert|40|km|mi|1|sp=us}} from [[Cameroon]]. [[Annob\u00f3n]] Island lies about {{convert|595|km|mi|0}} southwest of Bioko Island. The larger continental region of [[Rio Muni]] lies between Cameroon and [[Gabon]] on the mainland; it includes the islands of [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], [[Elobey Chico]], and adjacent islets.\n\nBioko Island, called Fernando Po until the 1970s, is the largest island in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] - {{convert|2017|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. It is shaped like a boot, with two large volcanic formations separated by a valley that bisects the island at its narrowest point. The {{convert|195|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}} coastline is steep and rugged in the south but lower and more accessible in the north, with excellent harbors at [[Malabo]] and [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]], and several scenic beaches between those towns.\n\nOn the continent, Rio Muni covers {{convert|26003|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. The coastal plain gives way to a succession of valleys separated by low hills and spurs of the [[Crystal Mountains (Africa)|Crystal Mountains]]. The [[Rio Benito]] (Mbini) which divides Rio Muni in half, is unnavigable except for a 20-kilometer stretch at its estuary. Temperatures and humidity in Rio Muni are generally lower than on Bioko Island.\n\nAnnobon Island, named for its discovery on New Year's Day 1472, is a small volcanic island covering {{convert|18|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}}. The coastline is abrupt except in the north; the principal volcanic cone contains a small lake. Most of the estimated 1,900 inhabitants are fisherman specializing in traditional, smallscale tuna fishing and whaling. The climate is tropical\u2014heavy rainfall, high humidity, and frequent seasonal changes with violent windstorms.\n\n'''Location:'''\nWestern [[Africa]], bordering the [[Bight of Biafra]], between [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]].\n\n== Boundaries ==\nEquatorial Guinea's land boundaries total 528&nbsp;km.

Local variations are due to differences in altitude and proximity to the sea. The wet seasons in the continental region are from February to June and from September to December. Rainfall is higher on the coast than inland. In Bata the rainiest months are September, October, and November, with rainfall averaging more than {{convert|94|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year. At Calatrava, farther south on the coast, it sometimes reaches {{convert|180|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Inland, however, rainfall diminishes; [[Micomeseng|Mikomeseng]], for example, receives only about {{convert|58|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The average annual temperature is about {{convert|79|F|C|1}} and is fairly constant throughout the year. The temperature maxima are somewhat lower than in Bioko. The relative humidity, however, is higher than in Bioko. Bioko has a rather debilitating climate. The so-called dry season lasts from November to March, and the rest of the year is rainy. The average annual temperature of about {{convert|77|F|C}} varies little throughout the year. Afternoon temperatures reach the high 80s \u00b0F (low 30s \u00b0C) and drop to only about {{convert|70|F|C|1}} at night. Most of the time the sky is cloudy and overcast.

The largest ethnic group, the [[Fang people|Fang]], are indigenous to the mainland, but substantial migration to [[Bioko Island]] has resulted in Fang dominance over the earlier Bubi inhabitants. The Fang constitute 80% of the population and are themselves divided into 67 clans. Those in the northern part of Rio Muni speak Fang-Ntumu, while those in the south speak Fang-Okah; the two dialects are [[mutually unintelligible]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubi]], who constitute 15% of the population, are indigenous to Bioko Island.\n\nIn addition, there are coastal ethnic groups, collectively referred to as ''Ndowe'' or \"Playeros\" (\"''Beach People''\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]): [[Combe people|Combes]], [[Bujeba people|Bujebas]], [[Balengue people|Balengues]] and [[Benga people|Bengas]] on the mainland and small islands and a [[Fernandinos|Fernandino]] community of [[Sierra Leone Krio people|Krio]] descended people on Bioko.

Most Spaniards left after independence.There is a growing number of foreigners from neighboring [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Gabon]]. Equatorial Guinea received [[Asians]] and black Africans from other countries as workers on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] plantations.In the late 20th century, Equatorial Guinea became home to more than 80,000 Hispanics from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish speaking nations in the Americas.Other black Africans came from [[Liberia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]], and Asians are mostly [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] with small numbers of [[India]]ns. Equatorial Guinea also allowed many fortune-seeking European settlers of other nationalities, including [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]] and [[Germans]]. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of dictatorship of [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]]. Some of its communities also live in [[Brazil]], [[United States]], Portugal, and [[France]].\n\n== Languages ==\n[[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the [[official language]]s and spoken as second languages. Spanish is the language of education, and for this reason a majority of the population (about 88%) can speak it, though only about 10\u201315% have a high competence in the language.<ref>[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/anuario/anuario_06-07/pdf/paises_08.pdf Gloria Nistal Rosique: El caso del espa\u00f1ol en Guinea Ecuatorial] (in Spanish)</ref> Annobonese speak a [[Portuguese Creole]], named [[Annobonese language|Annobonese]], as their first language.

[[Bubi people|Bubi]] and [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandino]] parties on the island preferred separation from [[R\u00edo Muni]] or a loose federation. Ethnically-based parties in R\u00edo Muni favored independence for a united country comprising [[Bioko]] and R\u00edo Muni, an approach that was adopted. The [[Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island]] (MAIB), which advocates independence for the island under Bubi control, is one of the offshoots of the era immediately preceding independence.\n\nEquatorial Guinea became independent from Spain on October 12, 1968.  Since then, the country has had [[Heads of State of Equatorial Guinea|two presidents]]: [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]], who had been the mayor of [[Mongomo]] under the Spanish colonial government, and [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] Mac\u00edas's nephew, who has ruled since 1979, when he staged a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and executed his uncle. When Mac\u00edas came to power, political activity largely ceased. Opposition figures among the exile communities in Spain and elsewhere agitated for reforms; some of them had been employed in the Mac\u00edas and Obiang governments. After political activities in Equatorial Guinea were legalized in the early 1990s, some opposition leaders returned to test the waters, but repressive actions have continued sporadically.\n\nThe [[Equatorial Guinean constitutional referendum, 1982|1982 Constitution]] gives Obiang extensive powers, including the right to name, and dismiss, members of the cabinet. The 1982 constitution also give him the power to make laws by decree, dissolve the Chamber of Representatives, negotiate and ratify international treaties, and calling legislative elections. Obiang retained his role as [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces and minister of defense when he became president and he maintains close supervision of military activity. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and operates under powers designated by the president. The prime minister coordinates government activities in areas other than foreign affairs, national defense and security.\n\nWith the prodding of the [[United Nations]], the [[United States]], Spain, and other donor countries, the government undertook an electoral census in 1995 and held freely contested municipal elections, the country's first, in September. Most observers agree that these elections were relatively free and transparent and also that the opposition parties garnered between 2/3 and 3/4 of the total vote. The government delayed announcing the results, then claimed a highly dubious overall 52% victory, and capture of 19 of the 27 municipal councils. The council of [[Malabo]], the capital, went to the opposition however. In early January 1996 Obiang called presidential elections, to be held in six weeks. The campaign was marred by allegations of fraud, and most of the other candidates withdrew in the final week. Obiang claimed re-election with 98% of the vote. International observers agreed the election was neither free nor fair. In an attempt to molify his critics, Obiang announced a new cabinet, giving minor portfolios to some people identified by the government as opposition figures.\n\nSince President Obiang has been constrained only by a need to maintain a consensus among his advisers and political supporters in the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea, most of whom are drawn from the Nguema family in [[Mongomo]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n|page=2\n|title=Polity IV Country Report 2010: Equatorial Guinea\n|date=2010\n|author=Political Instability Task Force\n|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency\n|url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/EquatorialGuinea2010.pdf\n}}</ref>\npart of the [[Esangu]] subclan of the [[Fang]] in the eastern part of R\u00edo Muni. Alleged coup attempts in 1981 and 1983 raised little sympathy among the populace.\n\nUnder Obiang, schools reopened and primary education expanded, public utilities and roads were restored, a favorable contast with Mac\u00edas' tyranny and terror, but his administration has been criticized for not implementing genuine democratic reforms. Corruption and a dysfunctional judicial system disrupt development of Equatorial Guinea's economy and society. In March 2001 the President appointed a new Prime Minister, [[C\u00e1ndido Muatetema Rivas]], and replaced several ministers perceived to be especially corrupt. However, the government budget still does not include all revenues and expenditures. The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has proposed a broad governance reform program, but the Equatorial Guinean Government has not moved very rapidly to implement it.\n\nAlthough Equatorial Guinea lacks a well-established democratic tradition comparable to the developed democracies of the West, it has progressed toward developing a participatory political system out of the anarchic, chaotic, and repressive conditions of the Mac\u00edas years. In power since 1979, the Obiang government has made little progress in stimulating the economy. Extremely serious health and sanitary conditions persist, and the educational system remains in desperate condition. Although the abuses and atrocities that characterized the Mac\u00edas years have been eliminated, effective rule of law does not exist. Religious freedom is tolerated.\n\nOn December 15, 2002,<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200212160112.html allAfrica.com: Equatorial Guinea: Obiang Sure to Win As Opposition Quits Poll (Page 1 of 1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Equatorial Guinea's four main opposition parties withdrew from the country's presidential election.

Spain in 1968. Thanks to the discovery and exploitation of significant [[oil reserves]] in the 1990s, it enjoys a [[purchasing power parity]] GDP per capita of more than US$38,699 which is as of 2016 the highest in Africa and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|31st highest]] in the world. However, the country has been ranked only [[List of countries by Human Development Index|138th out of 188 countries]] on the United Nations [[Human Development Index]] in 2015. After the oil price collapsed in 2014, the economy has gone into a free for all which has put growth in a downwards spiral from around 15% to -10%.\n\n==Economy overview==\n[[File:Equatorial Guinea Exports Treemap (2009).jpg|300px|thumb|Equatorial Guinea Exports Treemap (2009)]]\n[[File:Rent Equatorial Guinea.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of GDP per capita of Equatorial Guinea and Spain, the former colonial power in the Area, basend on A. Maddieson ([http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2010 AD]).]]\nPre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] production for hard currency earnings. In 1959 it had the highest [[per capita income]] of Africa which it still has.\n\nThe discovery of large [[oil reserves]] in 1996 and their subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. As of 2004,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1101-2004Sep6.html | work=The Washington Post | title=U.S. Oil Firms Entwined in Equatorial Guinea Deals | first=Justin | last=Blum | date=2004-09-07}}</ref> Equatorial Guinea was the third-largest oil producer in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Its oil production had then risen to {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d}}, up from {{convert|220000|oilbbl/d}} only two years earlier.\n\nForestry, [[agriculture|farming]], and [[fishing]] are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. However, the government has stated its intention to reinvest some [[petroleum|oil]] revenue into agriculture. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil revenues, the government has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a \"shadow\" fiscal management program with the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources include [[titanium]], [[iron ore]], [[manganese]], [[uranium]], and [[alluvium|alluvial]] [[gold]] ([[Mining industry of Equatorial Guinea|Mining in Equatorial Guinea]]). Growth remained strong in 2005 and 2006, led by oil.\n\n==In greater depth==\nOil and gas exports have increased substantially (in 2003 [[Equatorial Guinea]] was ranked third among [[Africa|Sub-Sahara African]] producers behind [[Nigeria]] and [[Angola]]) and will drive the economy for years to come. The GDP increased by 105.2% in 1997, and real GDP growth reached 23% in 1999, and initial estimates suggested growth of about 15% in 2001, according to IMF 2001 forecast. Per capita income grew from about $1,000 in 1998 to about $2,000 in 2000. The energy export sector is responsible for this rapid growth. Oil production has increased from {{convert|81000|oilbbl/d}} to {{convert|210000|oilbbl/d}} between 1998 and early 2001. There is ongoing additional development of existing commercially viable oil and gas deposits as well as new exploration in other offshore concessions.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has other largely unexploited human and natural resources, including a tropical climate, fertile soils, rich expanses of water, deepwater ports, and an untapped, if unskilled, source of labor. Following independence in 1968, the country suffered under a repressive dictatorship for 11 years, which devastated the economy. The agricultural sector, which historically was known for cocoa of the highest quality, has never fully recovered. In 1969 Equatorial Guinea produced 36,161 tons of highly bid cocoa, but production dropped to 4,800 tons in 2000. Coffee production also dropped sharply during this period to bounce back to 100,000 metric tons in 2000. Timber is the main source of foreign exchange after oil, accounting for about 12.4% of total export earnings in 1996-99. Timber production increased steadily during the 1990s; wood exports reached a record 789,000 cubic meters in 1999 as demand in Asia (mainly China) gathered pace after the 1998 economic crisis. Most of the production (mainly Okoume) goes to exports, and only 3% is processed locally. Environmentalists fear that exploitation at this level is unsustainable and point out to the permanent damage already inflicted on the forestry reserves on Bioko.\n\nConsumer price inflation has declined from the 38.8% experienced in 1994 following the CFA franc devaluation, to 7.8% in 1998, and 1.0% in 1999, according to BEAC data. Consumer prices rose about 6% in 2000, according to initial estimates, and there was anecdotal evidence that price inflation was accelerating in 2001.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's policies, as defined by law, comprise an open investment regime. Qualitative restrictions on imports, non-tariff protection, and many import licensing requirements were lifted when in 1992 the government adopted a public investment program endorsed by the World Bank. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has sold some state enterprises. It is attempting to create a more favourable investment climate, and its investment code contains numerous incentives for job creation, training, promotion of non-traditional exports, support of development projects and indigenous capital participation, freedom for repatriation of profits, exemption from certain taxes and capital, and other benefits. Trade regulations have been further liberalized since implementation in 1994 of the ICN [[turnover tax]], in conformity with Central African tax and custom reform codes. The reform included elimination of quota restrictions and reductions in the range and amounts of tariffs. The CEMAC countries agreed to replace the ICN with a value added tax (VAT) in 1999.\n\nWhile business laws promote a liberalized economy, the business climate remains difficult. Application of the laws remains selective. Corruption among officials is widespread, and many business deals are concluded under non-transparent circumstances.\n\nThere is little industry in the country, and the local market for industrial products is small. The government seeks to expand the role of free enterprise and to promote foreign investment but has had little success in creating an atmosphere conducive to investor interest.\n\nThe Equato-Guinean budget has grown enormously in the past 3 years as royalties and taxes on foreign company oil and gas production have provided new resources to a once poor government. The 2001 budget foresaw revenues of about 154 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] CFA francs (154 GCFAF) (about U.S.$200 million), up about 50% from 2000 levels. Oil revenues account for about two-thirds of government revenue, and VAT and trade taxes are the other large revenue sources.\n\nYear 2001 government expenditures were planned to reach 158 billion CFA francs, up about 50% from 2000 levels. New investment projects represented about 40% of the budget, and personnel and internal and external debt payments represented about one-third of planned expenditures.\n\nThe Equato-Guinean Government has undertaken a number of reforms since 1991 to reduce its predominant role in the economy and promote private sector development. Its role is a diminishing one, although many government interactions with the private sector are at times capricious. Beginning in early 1997, the government initiated efforts to attract significant private sector involvement through a Corporate Council on Africa visit and numerous ministerial efforts. In 1998, the government privatized distribution of petroleum products. There are now Total and Mobil stations in the country. The government has expressed interest in privatizing the outmoded electricity utility. A French company operates cellular telephone service in cooperation with a state enterprise. The government is anxious for greater U.S. investment, and President Obiang visited the U.S. three times between 1999 and 2001 to encourage greater U.S. corporate interest. Investment in agriculture, fishing, livestock, and tourism are among sectors the government would like targeted.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's balance-of-payments situation has improved substantially since the mid-1990s because of new oil and gas production and favorable world energy prices. Exports totaled about francs CFA 915 billion in 2000 (1.25 G$US), up from CFA 437 billion (700 M$US) in 1999. Crude oil exports accounted for more than 90% of export earnings in 2000. Timber exports, by contrast, represented only about 5% of export revenues in 2000. Additional oil production coming on line in 2001, combined with methanol gas exports from the new CMS-Nomeco plant, should increase export earnings substantially.\n\nImports into Equatorial Guinea also are growing very quickly. Imports totaled francs CFA 380 billion (530 M$US), up from franc CFA 261 million (420 M$US) in 1999. Imports of equipment used for the oil and gas sector accounted for about three-quarters of imports in 2000. Imports of capital equipment for public investment projects reached francs CFA 30 billion in 2000, up 40% from 1999 levels.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's foreign debt stock was approximately francs CFA 69 billion (100 M$US) in 2000, slightly less than the debt stock in 1999, according to BEAC data. Equatorial Guinea's [[debt service ratio]] fell from 20% of GDP in 1994 to only 1% in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves were increasing slightly, although they were relatively low in terms of import coverage. According to the terms of the franc CFA zone, some of these reserves are kept in an account with the French Ministry of Finance.\n\nEquatorial Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s received foreign assistance from numerous bilateral and multilateral donors, including European countries, the [[United States]], and the [[World Bank]]. Many of these aid programs have ceased altogether or have diminished. [[Spain]], [[France]], and the [[European Union]] continue to provide some project assistance, as do [[China]] and [[Cuba]]. The government also has discussed working with World Bank assistance to develop government administrative capacity.\n\nEquatorial Guinea operated under an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-negotiated [[Enhanced structural adjustment facility|Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) until 1996. Since then, there have been no formal agreements or arrangements. The International monetary Fund held Article IV consultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August 1999. After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for Equatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and more transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy sector revenue. IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data. In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements,  maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives. However, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nInfrastructure is generally old and in poor condition. Surface transport is extremely limited at present, with little more than 700 kilometres of paved roads. The African Development Bank is helping to improve the paved roads from Malabo to Luba and Riaba; the Chinese are undertaking a project to link Mongomo to Bata on the mainland, and the European Union is financing an inter-states road network linking Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon and Gabon. Road maintenance is often inadequate.\n\nElectricity is available in Equatorial Guinea's larger towns thanks to three small overworked hydropower facilities and a number of aged generators. In 1999, national production was about 13 MWh. In Malabo, the American company, CMS-Nomeco, built a 10 megawatt electricity plant financed by the government, which came in line in mid-2000, and plans to double capacity are advancing. This plant provides improved service to the capital, although there are still occasional outages. On the mainland the largest city, Bata, still has regular blackouts.\n\nWater is only available in the major towns and is not always reliable because of poor maintenance and mismanagement. Some villages and rural areas are equipped with generators and water pumps, usually owned by private individuals.\n\nParastatal Getesa, a joint venture with a minority ownership stake held by a French subsidiary of [[Orange S.A.|Orange]], provides telephone service in the major cities. The regular system is overextended, but Orange has introduced a popular GSM system, which is generally reliable in Malabo and Bata.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has two of the deepest Atlantic seaports of the region, including the main business and commercial port city of Bata. The ports of both Malabo and Bata are severely overextended and require extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning. The British company, Incat, has an ongoing project with the government to renovate and expand Luba, the country's third-largest port which is located on Bioko Island. The government hopes Luba will become a major transportation hub for offshore oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Guinea. Luba is located some 50 kilometres from Malabo and had been virtually inactive except for minor fishing activities and occasional use to ease congestion in Malabo. A new jetty is also being built at km 5 on the way from Malabo to the airport. It is a project mainly supposed to service the oil industry, but can also relieve the congested Malabo Port due to its closeness.\nThe Oil Jetty at km 5 was supposed to open the end of March 2003. Riaba is the other port of any scale on Bioko but is less active. The continental ports of Mbini and Cogo have deteriorated as well and are now used primarily for timber activities.\n\nThere are both air and sea connections between the two cities of Malabo and Bata. Most Soviet-built aircraft have been replaced mostly by ATR and Boeing operated by several small carriers, one state-owned, and the others private, constitute the national aircraft fleet. The runway at Malabo (3,200 m) is equipped with lights and can service aircraft similar to B777s and IL-76s. The one at Bata (2,400 m) does not operate at night but can accommodate aircraft as large as B737s. Their primary users are the national airline (EGA) and a private company (GEASA). Two minor airstrips (800 m) are located at Mongomo and Annobon. There are international connections out of Malabo to Madrid and Zurich in Europe and to Cotonou, Douala and Libreville in West Africa.\n\n== Energy developments ==\n{{main|Energy in Equatorial Guinea}}\nAfter a slow start, Equatorial Guinea has recently{{when|date=August 2013}} emerged as a major oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most promising [[hydrocarbon]] regions in the world. The main [[oil field]]s, Zafiro and Alba, both lie located offshore of Bioko island. In 1999 oil production was about five times its 1996 level; [[Zafiro Field]], operated by [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Ocean Energy]], produced about {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}}, and [[CMS Nomeco]] extracted approximately {{convert|6700|oilbbl/d}}. Aggressive field development and promising exploration activities may raise production to nearly {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d}} within 2 to 3 years (slightly above the current estimated production of Gabon) according to the official sources.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1995 Mobil (now Exxon Mobil) discovered the large Zafiro field,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | date = 1996-09-02\n | journal = [[Oil & Gas Journal]]\n | volume = 94\n | issue = 36\n | page = 38\n | issn = 0030-1388\n | accessdate = 2017-05-26\n | url = http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-94/issue-36/in-this-issue/drilling/equatorial-guinea-becomes-an-oil-producer.html\n | title = Equatorial Guinea becomes an oil producer\n | quote = Partners discovered the Zafiro oil accumulation in March 1995 and declared the field commercial in October 1995.\n}}\n</ref>\nwith estimated reserves of {{convert|400000000|oilbbl}}. Production began in 1996. The company announced a 3-year U.S.$1bn rapid-development program to boost output to {{convert|130000|oilbbl/d}} by early 2001. Progress was delayed due to a contractual dispute with the government and by unexpectedly difficult geology. The difference with the government was eventually resolved.\n\nIn 1998 a more liberal regulatory and profit-sharing arrangement for [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and production activities was introduced. It revised and updated the production-sharing contract, which, until then, had favoured Western operators heavily. As a result, domestic oil receipts rose from 13% to 20% of oil export revenue. However, the government's share remains relatively poor by international standards.\n\nIn 1997 CMS Nomeco moved to expand its operation with a U.S.$300m methanol plant. The plant entered production in 2000 and helped boost [[natural gas condensate]] output from Alba field.\n\nIn August 1999 the government closed bidding on a new petroleum-licensing round for 53 unexplored deepwater blocks and seven shallow-water blocks. The response was small due to a combination of factors, including falling oil-prices, restructuring within the oil industry, and uncertainty over an undemarcated maritime border with Nigeria (which was not resolved until 2000).\n\nIn late 1999 [[Triton Energy]], a U.S. independent, discovered La Ceiba in block G in an entirely new area offshore the mainland of the country. Triton expects a U.S.$200m development program to enable La Ceiba and associated fields to produce {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}} by late 2001, despite disappointments and technical problems at the beginning of the year.\n\nWith an upturn in oil prices, exploration intensified in 2000. In April 2000 U.S.-based Vanco Energy signed a production-sharing contract for the offshore block of Corisco Deep. In May 2000, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] was granted block L, offshore [[Rio Muni]], and a further three production-sharing contracts (for blocks J, I, and H) were signed with [[Atlas Petroleum]], a [[Nigerian]] company.\n\nIn early 2001 the government announced plans to establish a national oil company, to allow Equatorial Guinea to take a greater stake in the sector and to facilitate the more rapid transfer of skills. However, critics{{who|date=August 2013}} fear that such a company may become a vehicle for opaque accounting and inertia of the sort that has hindered development in neighbouring countries including [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Nigeria]].\n\nSince 2001 the government has created [[GEPetrol]], a national oil company; and [[Sonagas]], a national natural-gas company.  The company [[EG LNG]] has been created to construct and operate the Bioko Island [[LNG]] plant and terminal. The plant began to operate in May 2007 and a second plant is now{{when|date=August 2013}} under development.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/news/documents/FirstLNGCargoFromEquatorialGuinea.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516013344/http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/EN/news/documents/FirstLNGCargoFromEquatorialGuinea.pdf |date=May 24, 2007 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |title=First LNG Cargo From Equatorial Guinea |publisher=Marathon Oil}}</ref>\n\nEquatorial Guinea became a member of [[OPEC]] in May 2017.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/4305.htm |title=OPEC 172nd Meeting concludes |publisher=OPEC |date=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Animal husbandry==\nCattle and poultry production is rapidly reaching its pre-independence levels of self-sufficiency with the financial help of the [[African Development Bank]]. However, production of domesticated animals is hindered by the presence of [[trypanosomiasis]] and other tropical deterrents. In 2005 there were 37,600 sheep, 9,000 goats, 6,100 hogs, and 5,000 cattle.\n\n==Fishing==\nThe fishing industry gained strength through the 1980s and is now almost entirely modernized; a [[tuna]] processing plant went into operation in 1990. [[Annob\u00f3n]] subsists almost entirely on fishing and retains its traditional preeminence in off shore [[whaling]] and turtle gathering. Bioko is also a major fishing center, the chief catches being [[Perch (disambiguation)|perch]], tuna, [[mackerel]], [[cod]], [[Esox|pike]], [[shark]], and [[crayfish]]. The country\u2019s own catch was about 3,500 tons in 2003.\n\n==Forestry==\nTimber from R\u00edo Muni is Equatorial Guinea\u2019s leading export. Forests cover over 62 percent of the land area. The R\u00edo Muni area on the mainland produces okoum\u00e9 and akoga from rain forests of considerable age. Even though the government has given permission to foreign firms, exploitation is difficult due to infrastructural problems. The government enacted a new forestry action plan in 1990 in an effort to strengthen the sector\u2019s development. In 2004, roundwood production was estimated at 811,000 cubic metres. In 2004, exports of forest products amounted to $97 million:\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=55&pr.y=8&sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=616&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-08-24|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|0.09 Bln.\n|0.15 Bln.\n|0.19 Bln.\n|0.45 Bln.\n|6.20 Bln.\n|21.56 Bln.\n|23.48 Bln.\n|27.79 Bln.\n|33.38 Bln.\n|34.09 Bln.\n|31.43 Bln.\n|34.17 Bln.\n|37.68 Bln.\n|36.71 Bln.\n|37.22 Bln.\n|34.09 Bln.\n|31.18 Bln.\n|30.35 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|412\n|482\n|498\n|1,020\n|11,981\n|35,721\n|37,785\n|43,454\n|50,732\n|50,363\n|45,141\n|47,719\n|51,187\n|48,499\n|47,701\n|42,648\n|37,985\n|36,017\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|4.8 %\n|12.9 %\n|2.5 %\n|26.5 %\n|112.1 %\n|8.2 %\n|5.7 %\n|15.3 %\n|17.8 %\n|1.3 %\n|\u22128.9 %\n|6.5 %\n|8.3 %\n|\u22124.1 %\n|\u22120.7 %\n|\u22129.1 %\n|\u22129.7 %\n|\u22124.4 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|146 %\n|184 %\n|157 %\n|137 %\n|37 %\n|3 %\n|1 %\n|1 %\n|0 %\n|4 %\n|8 %\n|7 %\n|7 %\n|7 %\n|13 %\n|36 %\n|48 %\n|43 %\n|}\n\n; Investment (gross fixed):\n: 46.3% (2005 est.)\n; Industries:\n: Petroleum, fishing, sawmilling, natural gas\n; Industrial production growth rate:\n: 30% (2002 est.)\n; Electricity - production:\n: 29.43 GWh (2005)\n; Electricity - consumption:\n: 27.37 GWh (2005)\n; Agriculture - products:\n: [[Coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rice]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]] ([[tapioca]]), [[banana]]s, [[palm oil]] nuts; livestock; timber\n; Exchange rates:\n: Communaut\u00e9 financi\u00e8re africaine francs (CFAF) per US$1 - 480.56 (2005), 528.29 (2004), 581.2 (2003), 696.99 (2002), 733.04 (2001)\n\n{{See also|Equatorial Guinea}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- this 'empty' section displays references defined elsewhere -->\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Equatorial_Guinea/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n*[http://www.trademap.org/open_access/Index.aspx?proceed=true&reporter=226 Equatorial Guinea latest trade data on ITC Trade Map]\n*[http://www.equatorialoil.com/ Equatorial Oil]- Government source on economics, run by the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy\n\n{{Africa in topic|Economy of}}\n\n'''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Equatorial Guinea}}\n[[Category:African Union member economies|Equatorial Guinea]]\n[[Category:Economy of Equatorial Guinea| ]]\n[[Category:OPEC|Equatorial Guinea]]", "sha1": "j23zpr35yibke8uigw0z0cw1pnjeoy2"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Equatorial Guinea", "ns": "0", "id": "9372", "revision": {"id": "863598744", "parentid": "845984995", "timestamp": "2018-10-11T20:06:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Radio and television */[[WP:GenFixes]] on, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: t\u2019s \u2192 t's", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Telecommunications in Equatorial Guinea''' include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.\n\n==Radio and television==\n\n* [[Radio broadcasting|Radio stations]]:\n** 1 state-owned radio station, and 1 private radio station owned by the president's eldest son; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are accessible (2007);<ref name=CIAWFB-EquatorialGuinea-Communications-2014>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html \"Communications: Equatorial Guinea\"], ''World Factbook'', U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 27 January 2014.

[[Libel]] is a criminal offense, but there were no instances of the government using these laws to suppress criticism during 2012.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-EquatorialGuinea-2012/>\n\nThe constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but the government often does not respect these prohibitions. Search warrants are required unless the crime is in progress or for reasons of national security. Security forces enter homes without authorization and arrest alleged criminals, foreign nationals, and others, often without required judicial orders.  The government reportedly attempts to impede criticism by monitoring the activities of the political opposition, journalists, and others.

It has mostly small arms, [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Almost none of its [[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]]-style light-armored vehicles or trucks are operational.\n\nThe Armed Forces were reorganized in 1979. In 1988, the [[United States]] donated a 68-foot patrol boat to the [[Navy of Equatorial Guinea|Equatoguinean navy]] to patrol its exclusive economic zone. The U.S. patrol boat ''Isla de Bioko'' is no longer operational.<ref>U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/equatorialguinea/26446.htm Equatorial Guinea Background Note 01/02]</ref> U.S. military-to-military engagement has been dormant since 1997 (the year of the last [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] exercise). Between 1984 and 1992, service members went regularly to the United States on the International Military Education Training program, after which funding for this program for [[Equatorial Guinea]] ceased. The government spent 6.5% of its annual budget on defense in 2000 and 4.5% of its budget on defense in 2001. It recently acquired some Chinese artillery pieces, some Ukrainian patrol boats, and some Ukrainian helicopter gunships. The number of paved airports in Equatorial Guinea can be counted on one hand, and as such the number of airplanes operated by the air force is small. The Equatoguineans rely on foreigners to operate and maintain this equipment as they are not sufficiently trained to do so. Cooper and Weinert 2010 says that all aircraft are based on the military side of [[Malabo International Airport]].<ref>Cooper and Weinert 2010, p142</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a report said \"The oil companies do not view Equatorial Guinea's military \u2013 a product of decades of brutal dictatorial rule \u2013 with much confidence.

A dispute with [[President of Equatorial Guinea|President]] [[Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema]] in 1969 led to a request that all Spanish troops immediately depart, and a large number of civilians left at the same time. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were never broken but were suspended by Spain in March 1977 in the wake of renewed disputes. After Macias' fall in 1979, President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] asked for Spanish assistance, and since then, Spain has regained influence in Equatorial Guinea's diplomatic relations. The two countries signed permanent agreements for economic and technical cooperation, private concessions, and trade relations. President Obiang made an official visit to [[Madrid]] in March 2001, and senior Spanish Foreign Ministry officials visited [[Malabo]] during 2001 as well. Spain maintained a bilateral assistance program in Equatorial Guinea. Some Equato-Guinean opposition elements are based in Spain to the annoyance of the government in Malabo.\n\nThe government's official policy is one of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]]. In its search for assistance to meet the goal of national reconstruction, the government of Equatorial Guinea has established diplomatic relations with numerous European and [[Third World]] countries. Having [[History of Equatorial Guinea#Independence|achieved independence]] under UN sponsorship, Equatorial Guinea feels a special kinship with that organization. It became the 126th [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member]] on November 12, 1968.

A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at [[Atsbi Dera]] with in inscription mentioning \"GDR of Axum\".

As a result of Ezana's expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|province of Egypt]]. The degree of Aksum's control over Yemen is uncertain.

Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] believed this included Massawa, but instead, the port was handed by the Egyptians and the British to the Italians, who united it with the already colonised port of [[Asseb]] to form a coastal Italian possession. The Italians took advantage of disorder in northern Ethiopia following the death of Emperor Yohannes IV in 1889 to occupy the highlands and established their new colony, henceforth known as Eritrea, and received recognition from [[Menelik II]], Ethiopia's new Emperor.\n\nThe Italian possession of maritime areas previously claimed by Abyssinia/Ethiopia was formalized in 1889 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with [[Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia]] (r. 1889\u20131913) after the defeat of Italy by Ethiopia at the battle of [[Adwa|Adua]] where Italy launched an effort to expand its possessions from Eritrea into the more fertile Abyssinian hinterland.

In 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens. The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities. The number of Italians residing in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of Eritreans in the industries, trade and fruit plantation was expanded across the nation, while some of the plantations were owned by Eritreans.<ref>[http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/history-a-culture/450-italian-administration-in-eritrea  Italian administration in Eritrea]</ref>\n\nIn 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rise to power in Italy brought profound changes to the colonial government in Italian Eritrea.

When the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] from the Italians in spring 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged.\n[[Image:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|right|300px|The biggest extension of Eritrea was reached during the [[Italian empire]] (1936\u20131941), when northern parts of conquered Ethiopia were assigned to Eritrea by the Italians as a reward for the Eritrean \"Ascaris'\" help in the conquest of Ethiopia.]]\n\nThe following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops until the Italian armistice in September 1943.

This party ruled by Dr. Di Meglio obtained in 1947 the dismissal of a proposal to divide Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia.\n\nThe main objective of this italo-Eritrean party was Eritrea freedom, but they had a pre-condition that stated that before independence the country should be governed by Italy for at least 15 years (like happened with [[Italian Somalia]]).\n\n==British administration and federalisation==\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2016}}\nBritish forces defeated the Italian army in Eritrea in 1941 at the [[Battle of Keren]] and placed the colony under British military administration until [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] could determine its fate.

During the immediate postwar years, the British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines and parceled off to [[Sudan]] and Ethiopia. The [[Soviet Union]], anticipating an [[Italian Communist Party]] victory in the [[Italian general election, 1946|Italian polls]], initially supported returning Eritrea to Italy under [[Chapter XII of the United Nations Charter|trusteeship]] or as a colony. Soviet diplomats, led by [[Maxim Litvinov]] and backed by [[Ivan Maisky]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], even attempted to have Eritrea become a trustee of the Soviet Union itself.<ref>[[Vojtech Mastny]], ''The Cold War and Soviet Insecurity: The Stalin Years'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1996), pp. 23\u201324; Vladimir O.

There are only two main Christian-Muslim conflicts reported in Asmara, Eritrea (the Ethiopians supported by the Unionist Party played a big role in it), one was in 1946 where Sudanese Defence Forces were involved, and the other was in February 1950. This note is about that of 1950.\n\nThe UN Commission (UNC) arrived in Eritrea on February 9 and began its months-long inquiry 5 days later. Unionist Shifta activities supported by Ethiopia increased after its arrival, they became daring, better planned, better coordinated and innovative. The main target of the shifta was to disrupt the free movement of the UNC in areas controlled by the independence bloc supporters. The shifta attempted to prevent the rural population that supported independence from having an audience with the UNC. They targeted transportation and communication systems. Telephone lines connecting Asmara with major cities of the predominantly pro-independence areas of the western lowlands and Masswa were continually cut.\n\nAn active Muslim League local leader, from Mai Derese, Bashai Nessredin Saeed was killed by the Unionist Shifta at Emba Derho train station where he worked as a station manager, on February 20. According to an account of the incident written by Mufti Sheikh Ibrahim Al Mukhtar, at 07:30 in the evening of a Monday that date  5 shifta came and fired several bullets at him while he was on duty, He was critically wounded and was taken to Asmara immediately but died on the way. The reason for the killing was that they had asked him to abandon the Muslim League and join the Unionist Party (UP), but he refused. The killing sparked an outrage among Muslims in Asmara and a lot of people turned up the next day for his funeral to show their stand against the terrorist activities of the UP. A well organised funeral procession was arranged and attended by youth and Muslim dignitaries. The procession passed through three main streets before they reached the street where the UP Office was located. According to the Mufti, then the UP members started first to throw stones at the procession which was followed by three grenades and then chaos followed. There was open confrontation between both sides and many were killed and injured from both sides. The Police intervened by firing live ammunition, but the confrontations continued. Despite all this, the procession continued to the cemetery where the body was buried. The riots then spread to other areas and took a dangerous sectarian form. Many properties were also looted and burned. On Wednesday, the British Military Administration (BMA) declared a curfew from 5{{nbsp}}pm to 5{{nbsp}}am, but the riots continued, On Friday the curfew was extended to 22 hours.\n\nOn Thursday, the BMA administrator called for a meeting that included the Mufti and Abuna Marcos and asked them to calm the people and ask for reconciliation and both agreed. The next day a convoy of four cars: (In the first car were armed Police, in the 2nd was the Asmara Administrator with his Arabic translator, in the third were the Mufti and the Abuna and in the 4th was the Asmara & Hamassein Judge and the vice of the Abuna) moved to the districts of \u2018Geza Berhanu\u2019, Edaga Arbi, Akhria, Edaga Hamus, Aba Shawl, Hadish  Adi and Gaza Banda. In each location people were addressed with microphones to gather in both Arabic and Tigrinya and were told that the Police will not harm them. In places where there were a majority of Christians the Abuna will address them first and later the Mufti calling the people to end the violence and vice versa in the other locations where the majority were Muslims. Later the people were told to go back to their homes. In the evening the Mufti and the Abuna went to the Radio Station and advised the citizens to end violence. The wise men from both sides accepted the call, but the looting of properties of Muslim merchants continued for 3 more days before the riots came to an end.\n\nOn Saturday 25 February, the Copts met at the main church and Muslims at the grand mosque and discussed ways to end the violence. Both sides agreed to take an oath to prevent violence against each other. Each side appointed a four-member committee to oversee the agreements. Later 31 members from each side took an oath in front of the eight member committee. To prevent further violence in other areas, the committee of both sides decided to visit the Muslim and Christian cemeteries and lied flowers on the graveyard of the victims of both sides. More than 62 persons were killed and more than 180 were injured and the damage on the properties was huge. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This way the riots where the Ethiopian Liaison Officer played a big role to ignite was brought to an end by the wise religious leaders and elders of both sides.\n\nEthiopian ambition in the Horn was apparent in the expansionist ambition of its monarch when [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] claimed Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. He made this claim in a letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the Paris Peace Conference and at the First Session of the United Nations.<ref name=\"un\">{{cite book|last=Habte Selassie |first=Bereket |title=Eritrea and the United Nations |isbn= 0-932415-12-1 |publisher=Red Sea Press|year=1989}}</ref> In the United Nations the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued. The British and Americans preferred to cede Eritrea to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during [[World War II]]. \"The United States and the United Kingdom have (similarly) agreed to support the cession to Ethiopia of all of Eritrea except the Western province.

It was also at this juncture that the US Ambassador to the UN, [[John Foster Dulles]], said, \"From the point of view of justice, the opinions of the Eritrean people must receive consideration. ''Nevertheless'' the strategic interest of the United States in the Red Sea basin and the considerations of security and world peace make it necessary that the country has to be linked with our ''ally'' Ethiopia.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heiden|first=Linda|title=The Eritrean Struggle for Independence|journal=Monthly Review|volume=30|issue=2|date=19 June 197978|pages=15}}</ref> The Ambassador's word choice, along with the estimation of the British Ambassador in Addis Ababa, makes quite clear the fact that the Eritrea aspiration was for Independence.<ref name=\"un\"/>\n\nThe commission proposed the establishment of some form of association with Ethiopia, and the UN General Assembly on 2 December 1950 adopted that proposal along with a provision terminating British administration of Eritrea no later than 15 September 1952. The British, faced with a deadline for leaving, held [[Eritrean parliamentary election, 1952|Legislative Assembly elections]] on 25 and 26 March 1952, for a representative Assembly of 68 members, evenly divided between Christians and Muslims. This body in turn accepted a draft constitution put forward by the UN commissioner on 10 July. On 11 September 1952, Emperor Haile Selassie  ratified the constitution. The Representative Assembly subsequently became the Eritrean Assembly. In 1952 UN General Assembly Resolution 390 to federate Eritrea with Ethiopia went into effect.\n\nThe resolution ignored the wishes of Eritreans for independence, but guaranteed the population some democratic rights and a measure of autonomy. Some scholars have contended that the issue was a religious issue, between the Muslim lowland population desiring independence while the highland Christian population sought a union with Ethiopia. Other scholars, including the former Attorney-General of Ethiopia, [[Baraket Selassie|Bereket Habte Selassie]], contend that, \"religious tensions here and there...were exploited by the British, [but] most Eritreans (Christians and Moslems) were united in their goal of freedom and independence.\"<ref name=\"un\"/> Almost immediately after the federation went into effect, however, these rights began to be abridged or violated. These pleas for independence and referendum augured poorly for the US, Britain and Ethiopia, as a confidential American estimate of Independence Party support amounted to 75% of Eritrea.<ref>Department of State, Incoming Telegram, received 1949-08-22, From Addis Ababa, signed MERREL, to Secretary of State, No. 171, 1949-08-19</ref>\n\nThe details of Eritrea's association with Ethiopia were established by the [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 390A (V) of 2 December 1950. It called for Eritrea and Ethiopia to be linked through a loose federal structure under the sovereignty of the Emperor. Eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure, its own flag, and control over its domestic affairs, including police, local administration, and taxation.<ref name=\"un\"/> The federal government, which for all intents and purposes was the existing imperial government, was to control foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation. As a result of a long history of a strong landowning peasantry and the virtual absence of serfdom in most parts of Eritrea, the bulk of Eritreans had developed a distinct sense of cultural identity and superiority vis-\u00e0-vis Ethiopians. This combined with the introduction of modern democracy into Eritrea by the British administration gave Eritreans a desire for political freedoms alien to Ethiopian political tradition. From the start of the federation, however, Haile Selassie attempted to undercut Eritrea's independent status, a policy that alienated many Eritreans. The Emperor pressured Eritrea's elected chief executive to resign, made Amharic the official language in place of Arabic and Tigrinya, terminated the use of the Eritrean flag, imposed censorship, and moved many businesses out of Eritrea. Finally, in 1962 Haile Selassie pressured the Eritrean Assembly to abolish the Federation and join the Imperial Ethiopian fold, much to the dismay of those in Eritrea who favored a more liberal political order.\n\n==War for independence==\n{{main|Eritrean War of Independence}}\n[[Image:Ethiopia in its region (before 1993).svg|thumb|right|Map of Eritrea attached to Ethiopia.]]\nMilitant opposition to the incorporation of Eritrea into Ethiopia had begun in 1958 with the founding of the [[Eritrean Liberation Movement]] (ELM), an organization made up mainly of students, intellectuals, and urban wage laborers. The ELM, under the leadership of [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a former [[Eritrean Ascari]], engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state. By 1962, however, the ELM had been discovered and destroyed by imperial authorities.\n\nEmperor [[Haile Selassie]] unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and illegally  annexed the country in 1962. The war continued after Haile Selassie was ousted in a coup in 1974. The [[Derg]], the new Ethiopian government, was a [[Marxist]] military [[military dictatorship|junta]] led by [[strongman (political)|strongman]] [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].\n\nIn 1960 Eritrean exiles in [[Cairo]] founded the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF), which led the Eritrean independence struggle during the 1960s. In contrast to the ELM, from the outset the ELF was bent on waging armed struggle on behalf of Eritrean independence. The ELF was composed mainly of Eritrean Muslims from the rural lowlands on the western edge of the territory. In 1961 the ELF's political character was vague, but radical Arab states such as [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] saw Eritrea as a predominantly Muslim region struggling to escape Ethiopian oppression and imperial domination. These two countries therefore supplied military and financial assistance to the ELF.\n\nThe ELF initiated military operations in 1961 and intensified its activities in response to the dissolution of the federation in 1962. By 1967 the ELF had gained considerable support among peasants, particularly in Eritrea's north and west, and around the port city of [[Massawa]]. Haile Selassie attempted to calm the growing unrest by visiting Eritrea and assuring its inhabitants that they would be treated as equals under the new arrangements. Although he doled out offices, money, and titles mainly to Christian highlanders in the hope of co-opting would-be Eritrean opponents in early 1967, the imperial secret police of Ethiopia also set up a wide network of informants in Eritrea and conducted disappearances, intimidations and assassinations among the same populace driving several prominent political figures into exile. Imperial police fired live ammunition killing scores of youngsters during several student demonstrations in Asmara in this time. The imperial army also actively perpetrated massacres until the ousting of the Emperor by the Derg in 1974.\n[[File:Eritrean Independence War.gif|thumb|left|Map of the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]]]\nBy 1971 ELF activity had become enough of a threat that the emperor had declared [[martial law]] in Eritrea. He deployed roughly half of the Ethiopian army to contain the struggle. Internal disputes over strategy and tactics eventually led to the ELF's fragmentation and the founding in 1972 of the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF). The leadership of this multi-ethnic movement came to be dominated by leftist, Christian dissidents who spoke Tigrinya, Eritrea's predominant language. Sporadic armed conflict ensued between the two groups from 1972 to 1974, even as they fought Ethiopian forces.  By the late 1970s, the EPLF had become the dominant armed Eritrean group fighting against the Ethiopian Government, and [[Isaias Afewerki]] had emerged as its leader. Much of the material used to combat Ethiopia was captured from the army.\n\nBy 1977 the EPLF seemed poised to drive the Ethiopians out of Eritrea. However, that same year a massive airlift of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] arms to Ethiopia enabled the Ethiopian Army to regain the initiative and forced the EPLF to retreat to the bush. Between 1978 and 1986 the Derg launched eight unsuccessful major offensives against the independence movement. In 1988 the EPLF captured [[Afabet]], headquarters of the Ethiopian Army in northeastern Eritrea, putting approximately a third of the Ethiopian Army out of action and prompting the Ethiopian Army to withdraw from its garrisons in Eritrea's western lowlands. EPLF fighters then moved into position around [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], Eritrea's second-largest city. Meanwhile, other dissident movements were making headway throughout Ethiopia. At the end of the 1980s the Soviet Union informed Mengistu that it would not renew its defense and cooperation agreement. With the withdrawal of Soviet support and supplies, the Ethiopian Army's morale plummeted, and the EPLF, along with other Ethiopian rebel forces, began to advance on Ethiopian positions. In 1980 the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] determined that the right of the Eritrean people to self-determination does not represent a form of secession.<ref name=\"TheEritreanCase\">\n{{cite conference\n|title= Proceedings of the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal of the International League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples\n|booktitle= Session on Eritrea|publisher=Research and Information Centre on Eritrea\n|year=1984|location=Rome, Italy\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Provisional Government and People's Front for Democracy and Justice==\n[[File:Asmara-New Building.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Modern building in Asmara overlooking the Independence War Memorial]]\nThe [[United States]] played a facilitative role in the peace talks in [[Washington, DC|Washington]] during the months leading up to the May 1991 fall of the Mengistu regime. In mid-May, Mengistu resigned as head of the Ethiopian Government and went into exile in [[Zimbabwe]], leaving a caretaker government in [[Addis Ababa]]. Having defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea, EPLF troops took control of their homeland. Later that month, the United States chaired talks in [[London]] to formalize the end of the war. These talks were attended by the four major combatant groups, including the EPLF.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Mengistu government, Eritrean independence began drawing influential interest and support from the United States.  [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] Africa expert Michael Johns wrote that \"there are some modestly encouraging signs that the front intends to abandon Mengistu's autocratic practices.\"<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r102:E06MY2-393: \"Does Democracy Have a Chance?\"] by Michael Johns, ''The World and I'' magazine, August 1991 (entered in ''The Congressional Record'', May 6, 1992).</ref>\n\nA high-level U.S. delegation was also present in Addis Ababa for the July 1\u20135, 1991 conference that established a transitional government in Ethiopia. The EPLF attended the July conference as an observer and held talks with the new transitional government regarding Eritrea's relationship to Ethiopia. The outcome of those talks was an agreement in which the Ethiopians recognized the right of the Eritreans to hold a referendum on independence.\n\nAlthough some EPLF cadres at one time espoused a Marxist ideology, Soviet support for Mengistu had cooled their ardor. The fall of [[communist]] regimes in the former Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] convinced them it was a failed system. The EPLF now says it is committed to establishing a democratic form of government and a free-market economy in Eritrea. The United States agreed to provide assistance to both Ethiopia and Eritrea, conditional on continued progress toward democracy and human rights.\n\nIn May 1991 the EPLF established the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) to administer Eritrean affairs until a referendum was held on independence and a permanent government established. EPLF leader Afewerki became the head of the PGE, and the EPLF Central Committee served as its legislative body.\n\nEritreans voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence between 23 and 25 April 1993 in a UN-monitored [[Eritrean independence referendum, 1993|referendum]]. The result of the referendum was 99.83% for Eritrea's independence. The Eritrean authorities declared Eritrea an independent state on 27 April. The government was reorganized and the National Assembly was expanded to include both EPLF and non-EPLF members. The assembly chose Isaias Afewerki as President. The EPLF reorganized itself as a political party, the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ).\n\n==1990s==\n[[Image:Eritrea-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|right|300px|Eritrea after the independence in 1993]]\nIn July 1996 the [[Constitution of Eritrea]] was ratified, but it has yet to be implemented.\n\nIn 1998 a border dispute with Ethiopia, over the town of [[Badme]], led to the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] in which thousands of soldiers from both countries died. Eritrea suffered from significant economic and social stress, including massive population displacement, reduced economic development, and one of Africa's more severe [[land mine]] problems.\n\nThe border war ended in 2000 with the signing of the [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|Algiers Agreement]]. Amongst the terms of the agreement was the establishment of a UN peacekeeping operation, known as the [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] (UNMEE); with over 4,000 UN peacekeepers. The UN established a temporary security zone consisting of a 25-kilometre [[demilitarized zone|demilitarized buffer zone]] within Eritrea, running along the length of the disputed border between the two states and patrolled by UN troops. Ethiopia was to withdraw to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998. The Algiers agreement called for a final demarcation of the disputed border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia by the assignment of an independent, UN-associated body known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries and issue a final and binding ruling. The peace agreement would be completed with the implementation of the Border Commission's ruling, which would also end the task of the peacekeeping mission. After extensive study, the Commission issued a final border ruling in April 2002, which awarded some territory to each side, but Badme (the flash point of the conflict) was awarded to Eritrea. The Commission's decision was rejected by Ethiopia. The border question remains in dispute, with Ethiopia refusing to withdraw its military from positions in the disputed areas, including Badme, while a \"difficult\" peace remains in place.\n\nThe UNMEE mission was formally abandoned in July 2008, after experiencing serious difficulties in sustaining its troops after fuel stoppages.\n\nFurthermore, Eritrea's diplomatic relations with [[Djibouti]] were briefly severed during the border war with Ethiopia in 1998 due to a dispute over Djibouti's intimate relation with Ethiopia during the war but were restored and normalized in 2000. Relations are again tense due to a renewed border dispute. Similarly, Eritrea and [[Yemen]] had a border conflict between 1996 and 1998 over the Hanish Islands and the maritime border, which was resolved in 2000 by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[the Hague]].\n\n==Contemporary Eritrea==\n{{weasel words|date=December 2017}} {{POV|date=December 2017}}\nEritrea is an isolated country in the East of Africa.

A coastal plain, western lowlands, and some 350 islands comprise the remainder of Eritrea's land mass. Eritrea has no year-round rivers.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Eritrea is shaped by its diverse topography and its location within the tropics. \nThe diversity in landscape and topography in the highlands and lowlands of Eritrea result in the diversity of climate across the \ncountry. The highlands  have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences. Based on variations in temperature Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: a temperate zone, a subtropical climate zone and a tropical climate zone.<ref name=Mussie>{{cite book|author=Mussie Tesfagiorgis G.|title=Eritrea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&pg=PA10 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nEritrea can be divided into three major climate zones : the central highlands, the coastal region, and the western lowlands. Each has a different climate pattern. According to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Eritrea have either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the highest elevations.<ref name=Mussie/>\n\nIn the central highlands, the hottest month is usually May to June with highs around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (80.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing point. [[Asmara]] itself enjoys a pleasant climate all year round, although it can be quite cold at night in winter. There are two rainy seasons: the short rains in March and April and the main rains from late June to the beginning of September.\nOver there, the climate is usually sunny and dry as sunshine durations turn around 3,000 h and averages annual rainfall hover around 500&nbsp;mm (19.68&nbsp;in).<ref name=Mussie/>\n \nOn the coast along the [[Red Sea]], the summertime is long, from June to September and extremely hot with averages high temperatures ranging from 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 46&nbsp;\u00b0C (114.8&nbsp;\u00b0F), and it's even hotter in Denkalia. The wintertime is nearly non-existent and averages high temperatures remain above 28&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) during the least hot month of the year and averages low temperatures exceed 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). The rainy season along the coast north of [[Denkalia]] falls during the winter months but rainy days still remain scarce ; rainfall is even more rare in Denkalia Region. The climate is always sunny and dry in this zone and cloudy days are rare.<ref name=Mussie/>\n\nIn the western lowlands, the high temperatures are comparable to those on the coast in the hottest months of April until June.

Many also migrated to Sudan at the time of the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict and lived there since. They are a nomadic and pastoralist people, related to the [[Tigrayans]] and to the [[Beja people]]. They are a predominantly Muslim nomadic people who inhabit the northern, western, and coastal lowlands of Eritrea, where they constitute 30% of local residents.<ref name=\"Ciaethn\"/> Some also inhabit areas in eastern Sudan. 95% of the Tigre people adhere to the Islamic religion [[Sunni Islam]], but there are a small number of Christians among them as well (often referred to as the Mensa\u00ef in Eritrea).

Many of them entered Eritrea from Kush (central Sudan) in the 8th century and settled at Merara, after which they went to Lalibela and Lasta. The Bilen then returned to Axum in Ethiopia's [[Tigray Province]], and battled with the natives; in the resulting aftermath, the Bilen returned to their main base at Merara. The Bilen include adherents of both [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. They speak the [[Bilen language|Bilen]] as a mother tongue. Christian adherents are mainly urban and have intermingled with the Tigrinya who live in the area. Muslim adherents are mainly rural and have interbred with the adjacent Tigre.\n\n=====Beja=====\n{{main|Beja people}}\nThe Beja in Eritrea, or [[Hedareb]], constitute under 5% of local residents.<ref name=\"Ciaethn\"/> They mainly live along the north-western border with Sudan.

The empirical evidence from available surveys and the 2010 round of censuses has provided the basis for a reassessment of fertility levels and trends experienced within the last decade. In a number of countries, particularly in Africa, slower than\nexpected fertility declines or even stalled fertility was observed. In some cases, increases in total fertility were also recorded. This led to the decision not to apply the additional adjustment that was used in the 2010 Revision for a small number of countries at the very early  stage of their fertility transition (for example, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia) or that had experienced recent fertility stalling (for example, Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).

There have been no general elections since its official rise to power in 1993.

It declared that during a four-year transition period, and sooner if possible, it would draft and ratify a constitution, prepare a law on political parties, prepare a press law, and carry out elections for a constitutional government. In March 1994, the PGE created a constitutional commission charged with drafting a constitution flexible enough to meet the current needs of a population suffering from 30 years of civil war as well as those of the future, when stability and prosperity change the political landscape.\n\nCommission members have traveled throughout the country and to Eritrean communities abroad holding meetings to explain constitutional options to the people and to solicit their input. A new constitution was promulgated in 1997 but has not yet been implemented, and general elections have been postponed. A National Assembly, composed entirely of the PFDJ, was established as a transitional legislature; elections have been postponed indefinitely following the start of the border conflict with Ethiopia.\n\nIndependent local sources of political information on Eritrean domestic politics are scarce; in September 2001 the government closed down all of the nation's privately owned print [[News media|media]], and outspoken critics of the government have been [[arrest]]ed and held without [[trial]], according to domestic and international observers, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]].  In 2004 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] declared Eritrea a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) for its alleged record of religious [[persecution]].\n\nAt independence, the government faced formidable challenges. Beginning with a nascent judicial system, and an education system in shambles, it has attempted to build the institutions of government from scratch, with varying success.  Since then, the impact of the border war with Ethiopia, and continued army mobilisation, has contributed to the lack of a skilled workforce.  The present government includes [[legislature|legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]], and judicial bodies.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[Heads of State of Eritrea|President]]\n|[[Isaias Afewerki]]\n|[[People's Front for Democracy and Justice|PFDJ]]\n|24 May 1993\n|}\nThe President nominates individuals to head the various ministries, authorities, commissions, and offices, and the National Assembly ratifies those nominations. The cabinet is the country's executive branch. It is composed of 18 ministries and chaired by the president. It implements policies, regulations, and laws and is, in theory, accountable to the National Assembly.\n\nThe Ministries are:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* Agriculture\n* Defence\n* Education\n* Energy & Mines\n* Finance\n* Fisheries & Maritime Resources\n{{col-3}}\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Health\n* Information\n* Justice\n* Labour & Human Welfare\n* Land, Water, & Environment\n{{col-3}}\n* Local Government\n* National Development\n* Public Works\n* Tourism\n* Trade & Industry\n* Transport & Communications\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Eritrea composition}}\nThe legislature, the National Assembly appointed in 1993, includes 75 members of the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ) and 75 additional 'popularly elected' members. The National Assembly is the highest legal power in the government until the establishment of a democratic, constitutional government. Within the Eritrean Constitution the Legislature would remain the strongest arm of the government. The legislature sets the internal and external policies of the government, regulates implementation of those policies, approves the budget, and elects the president of the country.  Its membership has not been renewed through national elections.\n\nLower [[Regional Assemblies of Eritrea|Regional Assemblies]] are also in each of Eritrea's six zones. These Assemblies are responsible setting a local agenda in the case that they are not overruled by the National Assembly. These Regional Assemblies are popularly elected within each region. Unlike the National Assembly however, the Regional administrator is not selected by the Regional Assembly.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{main|List of political parties in Eritrea}}\nEritrea is a single-party state, run by the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ).  No other political groups are allowed to organize.\n\nEritrean National elections were set for 1997 and then postponed until 2001, it was then decided that because 20% of Eritrea's land was under occupation that elections would be postponed until the resolution of the conflict with Ethiopia. Local elections have continued in Eritrea. The most recent round of local government elections were held in May 2003.

A community court consists of three judges/magistrates. \"There are a total of 683 community courts across the country with the number of magistrates totaling to 2,049, i.e. 55 in the Central Region, 213 in the South, 178 in Gash-Barka, 109 in Anseba, 98 in the Northern and 30 in the Southern Red Sea regions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.shaebia.org/artman/publish/article_4206.html | title = Community Courts: Helping Citizens Settle Disputes out of Courts | publisher = PFDJ | date = 2005-11-23 | accessdate = 2006-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929111536/http://www.shaebia.org/artman/publish/article_4206.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-29}}</ref> The community courts work on the basis of the area, the local rules and customs.

Eritrean critics said industrialization in the years since then focused on other parts of Ethiopia. Ethiopia nationalized Eritrea's 42 largest factories and systematically dismantled the Eritrean industrial sector during the protracted civil war. By the time of its independence from Ethiopia in 1991, Eritrea's economy had been destroyed by war and was dependent on income from ports and its small agricultural base. The onset of conflict with Ethiopia, which lasted from 1998 to 2000, halted all bilateral trade, severely reducing port activity and income in Eritrea. According to [[World Bank]] estimates, Eritrea lost US$225 million worth of [[livestock]] and 55,000 homes during the war. GDP growth fell to zero in 1999 and to -1% in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryfacts.com/eritrea/economy/|title=Eritrea Economy GDP Currency Exports|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Planting of crops was prevented in Eritrea's most productive western region, causing food production to drop by 62%.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Damage to public buildings is estimated at US$24 million.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Gross domestic product (GDP)==\n[[File:Tree map exports 2009 Eritrea.jpeg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Eritrea's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\n\nEritrea's GDP, estimated at $4.037 billion in 2011, is 8.7 percent above the GDP in 2010. The growth was due to increased agricultural output and the expansion of the mining industry along with increasing gold prices. Breakdowns of the Eritrean economy by sector are not readily available; however, according to some estimates, in 2011 services accounted for 55 percent of the GDP, industry for 34 percent, and agriculture for the remaining 11 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/er.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The growth of the GDP, however, is compromised by the ongoing and tensions with the country's borders.\n\n==Industries==\n\n===Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing===\n{{see also|Agriculture in Eritrea}}\nIn 2004, [[agriculture]] employed nearly 80 percent of the population but accounted for only 12.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in Eritrea. The agricultural sector has improved with the use of modern farming equipment and techniques, and dams. Nevertheless, it is compromised by a lack of financial services and investment. Major agricultural products are [[barley]], [[beans]], [[dairy products]], [[lentil]]s, [[meat]], [[millet]], [[Skinning|leather]], [[sorghum]], [[teff]], and [[wheat]]. The displacement of 1 million Eritreans as a result of the war with Ethiopia, and the widespread presence of [[land mines]] all have played a role in the declining productivity of the agricultural sector. Currently, almost a quarter of the country's most productive land remains unoccupied because of the lingering effects of the 1998\u20132000 war with Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough [[forestry]] is not a significant economic activity in Eritrea, its forested area covers {{convert|1585000|ha|acre|abbr=off}}, or 13.5 percent of the total land area. Total roundwood production in 2004 was 1,266,000 cubic meters, nearly all of it used for [[fuel]]. Since 1993, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front army has been involved in tree planting and other [[afforestation]] activities; the annual average rate of [[deforestation]] during 1990\u20132000 was 0.3 percent.\n\nReliable figures on the extent and value of the [[fishing industry]] in Eritrea are difficult to obtain. However, Eritrea's long coastline offers the opportunity for significant expansion of the fishing industry from its current, largely artisanal, stage. Eritrea exports fish and sea cucumbers from the Red Sea to markets in Europe and Asia, and there is hope that the construction of a new, jet-capable airport in [[Massawa]], as well as rehabilitation of the port there, may support increased exports of high-value seafood. In 2002, exports were about 14,000 tons, but the maximum stable yield is thought to be nearly 80,000 tons. A fish processing plant was built in 1998 that now exports 150 tons of frozen fish every month to markets in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Tensions with [[Yemen]] over fishing rights in the [[Red Sea]] flared up in 1995 and again in 2002, and Eritrea's difficult relations with other nations could hamper further development of the industry.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Animal husbandry===\n[[Sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]] (especially [[zebu]]), and [[camel]]s make up the majority of Eritrea's livestock. In 2001, Eritrea had 2,100,000 sheep, 1,700,000 goats, 1,950,000 head of cattle, 75,000 camels, and 1.4 million [[chicken]]s. Total meat production that year was 30,900 tons; cow's milk, 39,200 tons; and eggs, 2,000 tons. The government is emphasizing development of agriculture and animal husbandry in order to decrease the reliance on international relief, caused by war.\n\n===Mining and minerals===\nEritrea's substantial mineral deposits are largely unexplored. According to the Eritrean government, artisanal mining in 1998 collected 573.4 kilograms of [[gold]], however the number of gold reserves is unknown. International observers also have noted Eritrea's excellent potential for quarrying ornamental marble and granite. As of 2001, some 10 mining companies had obtained licenses to prospect for different minerals in Eritrea. The government of Eritrea reportedly is in the process of conducting a geological survey for use by potential investors in the mining sector. The presence of hundreds of thousands of land mines in Eritrea, particularly along the border with Ethiopia, presents a serious impediment to future development of the mining sector.<ref name=cp/>\n\nNevsun Resources completed its Bisha mining project in early 2011. Estimated production will be 350,000 ounces of gold per year until the gold runs out, at which point the mine will produce copper and zinc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevsun.com/projects/bisha-main/|title=Nevsun Resources: Bisha Mine, Bisha Project, Gold Production, Gold Mine Africa, Mining Africa, Copper Mine, Mining Eritrea, Base Metal Properties, High-Grade Gold|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Industry and Manufacturing===\nBy the end the War of Independence, all industrial production had stopped due to the Ethiopians' nationalizing and breaking apart of Eritrea's largest factories, as well as the destruction of infrastructure by the weapons of the then Ethiopian government. The remaining plants were generally inefficient, and most of these industries required significant investment to achieve productivity. Since then, there has been a growth in industry. Manufactured items in 2002 included beverages, processed foods, [[tobacco]], [[leather]], [[textiles]], metal products, chemicals, printing, nonmetallic minerals, construction materials, [[salt]], [[paper]], and [[matches]]. The government sought privatization of these industries, and issued incentives such as exemptions from income tax, preferential treatment in allocation of foreign exchange for imports, and provisions for remittance of foreign exchange abroad. In 2002, there were approximately 2,000 manufacturing companies operating in the country.\n\nThe oil industry has potential, as major oil deposits are believed to lie under the [[Red Sea]]. In 2001, the United States firm [[CMS Energy]] entered into an exploration agreement with Eritrea for exploration in the [[Dismin Block]] in northeastern Eritrea. Due to high operating costs, the country's sole oil refinery, at [[Assab]], was closed\nin 1997. It had a crude refining capacity of {{convert|18000|oilbbl/d}}. The construction industry is growing, as projects range from the construction and expansion of power plants; road, airport, and dam construction; upgrading sea ports; and the construction of schools and hospitals.\n\nIn 2005, industry had a 26.3% share of the GDP; since 2011, it has grown to 34%. Recent industries include food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles, salt, cement, and commercial ship repair.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in Eritrea}}\nHouseholds consume more than 80 percent of total energy production. [[Electricity production]] in 2001 was estimated at 220.5 million kilowatt-hours. Consumption for that year was estimated at 205.1-kilowatt hours. An 88-megawatt electricity plant funded by [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Abu Dhabi]] was completed just south of Massawa in 2003, its completion delayed nearly three years by the war with Ethiopia. Annual consumption of petroleum in 2001 was estimated at 370,000 tons. Eritrea has no domestic petroleum production; the Eritrean Petroleum Corporation conducts purchases through international competitive tender. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, opportunities exist for both on- and offshore oil and natural gas exploration; however, these prospects have yet to come to fruition. The use of [[Wind energy]] and [[solar power]] have slightly increased, due to the growth of solar power manufacturing companies in the country. The Eritrean government has expressed interest in developing alternative energy sources, including geothermal, solar, and wind power.<ref name=cp/>\n\n[[File:Asmara, cinema impero, 01.JPG|thumb|Harnet Avenue in Asmara]]\n\n===Services===\nIn 2011, services accounted for 55 percent of gross domestic product. Financial services, the bulk of the services sector, are principally rendered by the [[National Bank of Eritrea]] (the nation's central bank), the Commercial Bank of Eritrea, the Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank of Eritrea, the Eritrean Investment and Development Bank, and the National Insurance Corporation of Eritrea.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Tourism===\nEritrea's lack of access to funds, the presence of large numbers of land mines, and the continued tensions that flare up between Eritrea and Ethiopia have deterred the development of a [[tourist industry]] in Eritrea. According to the [[World Tourism Organization]], international tourism receipts in 2002 were only US$73 million.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Banking and Finance===\n{{main|Banking in Eritrea}}\nAccording to the [[International Monetary Fund]], commercial banks in Eritrea\u2014all government owned and operated\u2014appear to be in compliance with prudent regulations. Although the commercial banking sector is largely profitable, mostly owing to income from foreign exchange transactions, the sector is burdened by a high proportion of non-performing loans. Core lending activities do not generate sufficient income to cover operating costs at most commercial banks.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Labor force==\nAgriculture employs about 80 percent of the population in Eritrea, and the remaining 20 percent are employed in industry and services. The GDP per capita at nominal value was $475 in 2011.\n\n==Currency, exchange rate, and inflation==\n\nThe official currency is the [[Eritrean nakfa]] (ERN), introduced in November 1997. In early 2005, likely in an effort to increase foreign capital reserves, the Eritrean government decreed that all transactions in Eritrea must be conducted in nakfa. It soon became illegal for individuals to hold and exchange foreign currency. As of January 1, 2005, the government set the foreign exchange rate at US$1=ERN15.<ref name=cp/>\n\n[[Inflation]] continues to be a problem in Eritrea, particularly as years of drought push grain prices higher and defense expenditures remain high. The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2003 (the most recent year for which figures are available) average inflation reached 23 percent.<ref name=cp/>\n\n[[File:Massawa Highway (8527952867).jpg|thumb|The Massawa-Asmara Highway, built as part of the [[Wefri Warsay Yika'alo]] program.]]\n==Government Budget==\nEritrea does not publish a budget, making its fiscal condition difficult to assess. According to the International Monetary Fund, the overall fiscal deficit in 2003 was 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Government expenditures for that year were estimated to be US$375 million, with revenues of only US$235.7 million. In 2002 the fiscal deficit was 32 percent of GDP. Current expenditures continue to exceed budgeted spending, particularly in defense and other discretionary expenditures. Monetary policy remains subservient to the financing demands of the government, and debt is unsustainably high. This situation is not likely to change until demobilization of the military occurs.<ref name=cp/> According to the CIA World Factbook, the Eritrean Government has revenues of $715.2 million, and outlays of $1.021 billion.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/er.html| CIA - The World Factbook</ref>\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\n[[China]], [[South Korea]], [[Italy]], [[South Africa]], and [[Germany]] are aggressively pursuing market opportunities in Eritrea. There is growing interest in U.S. products and services in Eritrea, although U.S. investment in Eritrea is still small.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn 2011, Eritrea imported goods worth US$899.9 million, including machinery, petroleum products, food, and manufactured goods. Eritrea's main suppliers were Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. In 2011 exports from Eritrea were valued at US$415.4 million, and the bulk were food, livestock, small manufactures, sorghum, and textiles. The major markets for Eritrean goods were China, Egypt, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the UK. More recently, fish, flowers, and salt have joined the list of exports.\n\nForeign investment is hindered by government regulations that seek to protect domestic industries from foreign competition and by a generally unfavorable investment climate. Major foreign investors in Eritrea include China, South Korea, Italy, South Africa, and Germany, as well as the [[World Bank]].<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe government prefers private-sector investment to official aid programs and declines foreign aid; therefore its relations with aid-dispensing nations and international institutions have often been difficult.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Eritrea}}\n*[[Eritrea]]\n*[[Banking in Eritrea]]\n*[[List of companies based in Eritrea]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Eritrea/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n*[http://www.trademap.org/open_access/Index.aspx?proceed=true&reporter=232 Eritrea latest trade data on ITC Trade Map]\n*[http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0518.htm IMF Executive Board Concludes Consultation with Eritrea February 2005]\n\n{{Africa in topic|Economy of}}\n{{Eritrea topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Eritrea}}\n[[Category:Economy of Eritrea| ]]\n[[Category:African Union member economies|Eritrea]]", "sha1": "sda44l2cpn842s7tocfsoz07vcz4b7c"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Eritrea", "ns": "0", "id": "9382", "revision": {"id": "845985001", "parentid": "845148314", "timestamp": "2018-06-15T13:51:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 2 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Telecommunications in Eritrea''' are under the authority of the [[Government of Eritrea]].\n \n==Infrastructure==\nThe [[Eritrean Telecommunications Corporation|Eritrea Telecommunication Services Corporation]], more commonly known as ''EriTel'', is the sole operator of both landline and mobile telephone communication infrastructure in [[Eritrea]].

Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable. The next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects [[Districts of Eritrea|district]] capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major towns in Eritrea. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+Primary Highways of Eritrea<ref name=\"MoPW\">{{cite press release|title= Eritrea Road Network and Distances |publisher=Ministry of Public Works |date=August 2003}}</ref>\n|-\n!

It is located on the [[Red Sea]] with a foothold on the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Straits of Bab al-Mandeb]].\n\n==History==\nMilitary history in [[Eritrea]] stretches back for thousands of years; during ancient times up until the current day, the society of Eritreans has dealt with war and peace. During the kingdom of [[Medri Bahri]], the military fought numerous battles against the invading forces of the Abyssinians to the south and the [[Ottoman Turks]] at the Red Sea.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Eritrea: A Pawn in World Politics|author=Yohannes, O.|date=1991|publisher=University of Florida Press|isbn=9780813010441|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sG41eDVRDnoC|page=31|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the port of [[Massawa]] was used by the Ottomans to protect sea lanes from disruption, while more recently it was used by the Italians during their colonial occupation. The kingdom of Medri Bahri was dissolved and the Colony of Eritrea was founded by the Italians in 1890, shortly after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. When Italian troops occupied Ethiopia in 1936, Eritrean native soldiers (known as Askaris or ''Banda'', the latter denotes their \"betrayal\" and service for the enemy) supported the invading force. However, this was reversed by British and Ethiopian troops in 1941. The Eritrean infantry battalions and cavalry squadrons of the \"Reale Esercito Coloniale\" (Royal Colonial Army) saw extensive service in the various Italian colonial territories between 1888 and 1942.\n\nDuring the war for Eritrea's independence rebel movements (the [[Eritrean Liberation Front|ELF]] and the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front|EPLF]]) used volunteers. In the final years of the struggle for independence, the EPLF ranks grew to 110,000 volunteers (some 3% of the total population).\n\n==Manpower==\nThe Eritrean Defence Forces are among the largest in Africa alongside those of [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Egypt]], [[Military of Algeria|Algeria]], and [[Royal Moroccan Armed Forces|Morocco]]. The size of Eritrea's population is small, particularly when compared to its neighbors. During peacetime the military of Eritrea numbers approximately 45,000<ref>{{cite book| last=Killion | first=Tom | title=Historical Dictionary of Eritrea |isbn= 0-8108-3437-5 | publisher=The Scarecrow Press | year=1998 }}</ref> with a reserve force of approximately 250,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asmara's Finest |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/HB7895_ERI.html |accessdate=4 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===National service===\nEvery able bodied man and woman is required to serve ostensibly for 18 months. In this time they receive six months of military training and the balance is spent working on national reconstruction projects. This is outlined in both the Constitution of Eritrea and Proclamation 82 issued by the [[National Assembly of Eritrea|National Assembly]] on 1995-10-23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.child-soldiers.org/document_get.php?id=772 |title=Eritrea |accessdate=13 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040220/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document_get.php?id=772 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> However, the period of enlistment may be extended during times of national crisis and the typical period of national service is considerably longer than the minimum.

Students, both male and female, are required to attend the Sawa Training Centre to complete the final year of their secondary education, which is integrated with their military service. If a student does not attend this period of training, he or she will not be allowed to attend university - many routes to employment also require proof of military training. However, they may be able to attend a vocational training centre, or to find work in the private sector. At the end of the 1\u00bd-year national service, a conscript can elect to stay on and become a career military officer. Conscripts who elect otherwise may, in theory, return to their civilian life but will continue to be reservists. In practice, graduates of military service are often chosen for further national service according to their vocation - for example, teachers may be compulsorily seconded for several years to schools in an unfamiliar region of the country. According to the Government of Eritrea, \"The sole objective of the National Service program is thus to cultivate capable, hardworking, and alert individuals.\"<ref name=\"Conscripts\" />\n\nEritrean conscripts are used in non-military capacities as well. Soldiers are often used as supplemental manpower in the country's agricultural fields picking crops, though much of the harvested food is used to feed the military rather than the general population.<ref>ERITREAN TROOPS SENT TO HARVEST GRAIN (2008 November 3) https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08ASMARA529_a.html </ref>\n\n==Branches of the EDF==\nThe Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) are composed of three branches: Air Force, Army, and Navy.

It borders the [[Gulf of Finland]], between [[Latvia]] and [[Russia]]. Average elevation reaches only {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n \nThe climate is maritime, wet, with moderate winters and cool summers. [[Oil shale]] and [[limestone]] deposits, along with [[forest]]s which cover 47% of the land, play key economic roles in this generally resource-poor country. Estonia boasts over 1,500 [[lakes]], numerous [[bog]]s, and 3,794 kilometers of [[coastline]] marked by numerous bays, straits, and inlets. [[Tallinn]]'s [[Port of Muuga|Muuga port]] offers one of Europe's finest [[ice-free port|warm-water harbor]] facilities.\n\nEstonia's strategic location has precipitated many wars that were fought on its territory between other rival powers at its expense. In 1944, under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation, the [[Ivangorod|Jaanilinn]] and [[Pechory|Petseri]] regions were annexed to [[Russian SFSR]] territory. The legal status of these territories has not been fully settled yet, though neither Estonia or Russia has not any territorial claims.\n\n'''Geographic coordinates:''' {{coord|59|00|N|26|00|E|type:country}}.\n\n==Geographic features==\n{{See also|List of islands of  Estonia}}\n{{See also|List of rivers of  Estonia}}\nEstonia is a flat country covering {{convert|45339|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. Estonia has a long, shallow coastline ({{convert|3794|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) along the Baltic Sea, with 1,520 islands dotting the shore. The two largest islands are [[Saaremaa]] (literally, island land), at {{convert|2673|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and Hiiumaa, at {{convert|989|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. The two islands are favorite Estonian vacation spots. The country's highest point, Suur Munam\u00e4gi (Egg Mountain), is in the hilly southeast and reaches {{convert|318|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Estonia is covered by about {{convert|18000|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of forest. Arable land amounts to about {{convert|9260|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. Meadows cover about {{convert|2520|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and pastureland covers about {{convert|1810|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. There are more than 1,400 natural and artificial lakes in Estonia. The largest of them, [[Lake Peipus]] ({{convert|3555|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), forms much of the border between Estonia and Russia. Located in central Estonia, [[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]] is the second-largest lake ({{convert|270|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The [[Narva River|Narva]] and [[Emaj\u00f5gi]] are among the most important of the country's many rivers.\n\nA small, recent cluster of meteorite craters, the largest of which is called [[Kaali crater|Kaali]] are found near [[Saaremaa]], Estonia. It is thought that the impact was witnessed by the Iron Age inhabitants of the area.\n\nEstonia has a temperate climate, with four seasons of near-equal length. Average temperatures range from {{convert|16.3|\u00b0C|1|lk=on}} on the Baltic islands to {{convert|17.1|\u00b0C|1}} inland in July, the warmest month, and from {{convert|\u22123.5|\u00b0C|1}} on the Baltic islands to {{convert|\u22127.6|\u00b0C|1}} inland in February, the coldest month. Precipitation averages {{convert|568|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year and is heaviest in late summer.\n\nEstonia's land border with Latvia runs {{convert|333|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; [[Estonia-Russia border|the Russian border]] runs {{convert|324|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. From 1920 to 1945, Estonia's border with Russia, set by the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty, extended beyond the Narva River in the northeast and beyond the town of [[Petseri]] in the southeast. This territory, amounting to some {{convert|2300|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, was incorporated into Russia by [[Joseph Stalin]] at the end of [[World War II]].\n\n==Environmental issues==\n{{See also|Protected areas of Estonia}}\n[[File:Suur-Pakri - kaugpommitajate pol\u00fcgoon.JPG|thumb|The Soviet army used the [[Pakri Islands]] as sites for aerial bombardment. The collection and destruction of thousands of Soviet explosive devices was mostly complete by 1997.]]\nOne of the most burdensome legacies of the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is widespread environmental pollution.<ref>Auer, M.R., Raukas, A. (2002). Determinants of environmental cleanup in Estonia. ''Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy'', 20: 679\u2013698.</ref> The worst offender in this regard was the Soviet army. Across military installations covering more than 800&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Estonian territory, the army dumped hundreds of thousands of tons of jet fuel into the ground, improperly disposed of toxic chemicals, and discarded outdated explosives and weapons in coastal and inland waters. In the 1990s, during the army's withdrawal from Estonia, extensive damage was done to discarded buildings and equipment. In October 1993, the Estonian Ministry of Environment issued a preliminary report summing up part of the degradation it had surveyed thus far. The report described the worst damage as having been done to Estonia's topsoil and underground water supply by the systematic dumping of jet fuel at six Soviet army air bases. At the air base near Tapa, site of the worst damage, officials estimated that six square kilometers of land were covered by a layer of fuel; 11 square kilometers of underground water were said to be contaminated. The water in the surrounding area was undrinkable, and was sometimes set fire by locals to provide heat during the winter. With Danish help, Estonian crews began cleaning up the site, although they estimated the likely cost to be as much as 4 million EEK. The Ministry of Environment assigned a monetary cost of more than 10 billion EEK  {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} to the damage to the country's topsoil and water supply. However, the ministry was able to allocate only 5 million EEK in 1993 for cleanup operations.\n\nIn a 1992 government report to the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, Estonia detailed other major environmental concerns. For instance, for several consecutive years Estonia had led the world in the production of sulfur dioxide per capita. Nearly 75% of Estonia's air pollution was reported to come from [[Narva Power Plants|two oil shale-based thermal power stations operating near Narva]]. The [[Oil shale in Estonia|mining of oil shale]] in northeastern Estonia has also left large mounds of limestone [[tailings]] and ash dotting the region. Near the town of [[Sillam\u00e4e]], site of a former uranium enrichment plant, about 1,200 tons of uranium and about 750 tons of thorium had been dumped into a reservoir on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. This was said to have caused severe health problems among area residents. In the coastal town of Paldiski, the removal of waste left by Soviet army nuclear reactors was also a major concern. The combined cost of environmental cleanup at both towns was put at more than EKR3.5 billion.\n\n'''Natural hazards:''' flooding occurs frequently in the spring in certain areas\n\n'''Environment \u2013 current issues:'''  air polluted with sulfur dioxide from oil-shale burning power plants in northeast; however, the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have fallen steadily, the emissions of 2000 were 80% less than in 1980; the amount of unpurified wastewater discharged to water bodies in 2000 was 1/20 the level of 1980; in connection with the start-up of new water purification plants, the pollution load of wastewater decreased; Estonia has more than 1,400 natural and man-made lakes, the smaller of which in agricultural areas need to be monitored; coastal seawater is polluted in certain locations.\n\n'''Environment \u2013 international agreements:'''<br />\n''party to:'' Air Pollution, Antarctic Treaty, [[Biodiversity]], Climate Change, Climate Change-[[Kyoto Protocol]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands<br />\n''signed, but not ratified:'' none\n\n==Area and boundaries==\n[[File:Hellamaa panoraam.jpg|thumb|300px|Hellamaa bay in [[Hiiumaa]].]]\n'''Area:'''<br />\n''total:'' 45,228 km\u00b2<br />\n''land:'' 42,288&nbsp;km\u00b2<br />\n''water:'' 2,840&nbsp;km\u00b2<br />\n''note:'' includes 1,520 islands in the Baltic Sea\n\n'''Land boundaries:'''<br />\n''total:'' 657&nbsp;km<br />\n''border countries:'' Latvia 333&nbsp;km, Russia 324&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:''' 3,794&nbsp;km\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''<br />\n''territorial sea:'' {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}\n''exclusive economic zone:'' limits fixed in coordination with neighboring states\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''<br />\n''lowest point:'' Baltic Sea 0 m<br />\n''highest point:'' [[Suur Munam\u00e4gi]] 317 m<ref>[http://www.estonica.org/en/Nature/Location_and_natural_conditions/Topography/ Topography] Estonica: Encyclopedia about Estonia</ref>\n\n==Resources and land use==\n[[File:Pine forest in Estonia.jpg|thumb|Forests cover more than half of the territory of Estonia.]]\n'''Natural resources:''' [[oil shale]] ([[kukersite]]), [[peat]], [[phosphorite]], [[cambrian blue clay]], [[limestone]], [[sand]], [[dolomite]], [[arable land]], [[forest]]\n\n'''Land use:'''<br />\n''arable:'' 14.65%<br />\n''permanent crops:'' 0.14%<br />\n''other:'' 85.21% (2012)\n\n'''Irrigated land:''' 4.58&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:''' 12.81&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''\n<br>''total:'' 1.8&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr (3%/97%/0%)\n<br>''per capita:'' 1,337 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2009)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Climate of Estonia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Estonia topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Geography of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Estonia}}\n[[Category:Geography of Estonia| ]]", "sha1": "i8p7md4enyoa85dcx1c6q1k2zjdnhmq"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Estonia", "ns": "0", "id": "9389", "revision": {"id": "864143853", "parentid": "863199389", "timestamp": "2018-10-15T11:14:33Z", "contributor": {"ip": "84.50.211.184"}, "comment": "/* Current natural increase */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "The '''demographics of Estonia''' in the twenty-first century result from historical trends over more than a thousand years, as with most European countries, but have been disproportionately influenced by events in the last half of the twentieth century.

[[Nordic identity in Estonia]] is prevalent and well established. This highly literate society places strong emphasis upon education, which is free and compulsory until age 16.\n\nIn the twentieth century, [[Russianization|Estonia's ethnic makeup was altered radically]] by policies implemented by the [[USSR|Soviet]] government. Large numbers of ethnic Russians were incentivized to move into the non-Russian republics, including Estonia. The population was further altered by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s mass deportations and executions while many people simply left as a result of [[World War II]].\n\n== Population ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Population decline in Estonia\n | width     = 320\n | image1    = Population of Estonia (1970-2010).png\n | caption1  = Population of Estonia (1970\u20132010).

The proportion of the age group 15\u201364 also slightly increased to 68% in 2009.\n\n=== Births and deaths ===\nFrom 1947\u20131989 the number of births was higher than the number of deaths, but from 1990 onwards the number of deaths outnumbered the number of births. The crude birth rate of 2011 was 10.96 (14,679 births) and the crude death rate of 2011 was 11.38 (15,244 deaths), making the rate of natural increase \u22120.42 (\u2212565).<ref name=\"Births, deaths and natural increase\"/> For more detailed historic data, see the [[Demographics of Estonia#Table of birth and death rates|table of birth and death rates]] below.\n\n=== Total fertility rate ===\nBetween 1970 and 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) was little over 2 children born per woman.<ref name=\"Main demographic indicators\">{{cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/02Main_demographic_indicators/02Main_demographic_indicators.asp|title=Main demographic indicators|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> A fast decrease of the TFR occurred after independence. In 1998 the lowest rate was recorded: 1.28 children born per [[Women in Estonia|women]]. The TFR slightly recovered in the subsequent years. The TFR was 1.66 in 2008 and 1.52 in 2011.\n\n=== Infant mortality rate ===\nThe infant mortality rate in Estonia has decreased considerably during the past decades. In 1970 the rate was 17.7 per 1,000 live births.<ref name=\"Main demographic indicators\"/> The rate decreased to 17.1 in 1980, 12.3 in 1990 and 8.4 in 2000. The lowest infant mortality rate was recorded in 2011: 2.6.\n\n=== Life expectancy at birth ===\nLife expectancy in Estonia is lower than in most Western European countries. During the Soviet era life expectancy in males was between 64 and 66 years and in females between 73 and 75 years.<ref name=\"Main demographic indicators\"/> After the independence, life expectancy decreased for a number of years. In 1994, the lowest life expectancy was recorded: 60.5 years in males and 72.8 in females.

Mainly ethnic [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] emigrated. Consequently, the proportion of these ethnic groups decreased as can be seen in the results of the 2000 census (see below). Data from 2000\u20132009 also shows that the number of emigrants is larger than the number of immigrants, but on a much lower lever than in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Migration\"/>\n\n== Ethnic groups ==\n{{See also|Estonian Swedes|Baltic Germans|Russians in Estonia|Armenians in Estonia|V\u00f5ros|Setos}}\nToday, Estonia is an ethnically fairly diverse country, ranking 97th out of 239 countries and territories in 2001 study by Kok Kheng Yeoh.<ref name=\"TOWARDS AN INDEX OF ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION\">\n{{cite web\n |title=TOWARDS AN INDEX OF ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION\n |url=http://cmsad.um.edu.my/images/fep/doc/2001%20Pdf/FEA-WP-2001-003.pdf\n |publisher=University of Malaya\n |date=2008-10-17\n |accessdate=2010-10-11\n}}</ref> In 2008, thirteen of Estonia's fifteen counties were over 80% ethnic Estonian.

According to the census of 2000, 109 languages were spoken natively in Estonia. By 2011, the number of languages spoken natively had increased to 157, mainly due to new immigrants. However, most of these languages were used only between relatives or compatriots, while only 30 languages were spoken on a daily basis in families.<ref>Mart Rannut.

Nevertheless, the two languages are not [[mutually intelligible]], although educated native speakers can read the other language with a greater or lesser degree of understanding. Estonian and Finnish are only distantly related to the [[Hungarian language]].\n\nWritten with the [[Latin script]], Estonian is the language of the Estonian people and the official language of the country. One-third of the standard vocabulary is derived from adding suffixes to root words. The oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th century chronicles. During the [[Estonian SSR|Soviet era]], the [[Russian language]] was imposed in parallel to, and often instead of, Estonian in official use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n'''Population of Estonia by first language'''\n|-bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Language\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2000 census<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/I_Databas/Population_census/PHC2000/08Ethnic_nationality._Mother_tongue._Command_of_foreign_languages/08Ethnic_nationality._Mother_tongue._Command_of_foreign_languages.asp|title=Ethnic nationality.

democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Riigikogu|Estonian parliament]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Estonia|government]], which is led by the [[Prime Minister of Estonia|prime minister]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Estonia is a member of [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], and [[NATO]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Die Verfassung der Republik Estland (1937) Seite 01.jpg|thumb|German translation of the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia]]\n{{main|History of Estonia}}\nThe [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued on 21 February 1918. A parliamentary republic was formed by the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] and the first [[Constitution of Estonia]] was adopted on June 15, 1920. The [[Parliament of Estonia]] (State Assembly) elected a [[Riigivanem]] who acted both as [[Head of Government]] and [[Head of State]]. During the [[Era of Silence]], political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 because the country was ruled by [[decree]] of [[Konstantin P\u00e4ts]], who was elected as the first [[President of Estonia]] in 1938. In 1938 a new constitution was passed and the Parliament of Estonia was convened once again, this time [[bicameral]]ly, consisting of [[Riigivolikogu]] ([[lower house]]) and [[Riigin\u00f5ukogu]] ([[upper house]]), both meaning State Council in direct translation. In 1940, Estonia was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. It was soon followed by the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War II| German occupation of 1941-1944]]. During the course of the two occupations, legal institutions, elected according to the Estonian constitution, were removed from power. In September 1944, after German forces left, legal power was briefly restored, as [[Otto Tief]] formed a new government in accordance with the 1938 constitution. The Tief government lasted for  only 5 days, as Estonia was again occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1991 the Republic of Estonia was restored on the basis of continuity of the constitution prior to 1938, with the [[Estonian referendum, 1992|public approving]] a new constitution in 1992. [[Estonia]] declared independence in 1991 causing the transition from a state socialist economy to the capitalist market economy. On 1 May 2004, Estonia was accepted into the [[European Union]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Institutions==\n\nThe framework for the political institutions of [[Estonia]] is provided by the [[Constitution of Estonia]] ({{lang-et|Eesti Vabariigi p\u00f5hiseadus}}). The constitution follows the principle of [[separation of powers]]. Legislative power is wielded by the Parliament, executive power by the Government and judicial power by the courts. Each institution is further defined by their respective [[Legislation|legislative acts]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===Parliament===\n\n[[File:Riigikogu (2011).jpg|thumb|The Riigikogu (Parliament of Estonia) in the Toompea Castle of Tallinn, Estonia.]]\n{{main|Riigikogu}}\nThe [[Parliament of Estonia|Parliament]] ({{lang-et|Riigikogu}}) is the [[Representative democracy|representative]] [[legislative]] authority of the Republic of Estonia. It comprises 101 members who are elected at free elections for a four-year term according to the principle of [[proportional representation]]. The work of the Parliament is coordinated by the Board of the ''Riigikogu'', which is led by the President of the ''Riigikogu'' and is elected for a term of one year. There are also [[Political faction|factions]] within the Parliament, which carry out the programmes of their respective political parties. The work of the Parliament is supported by various committees, which are staffed by members of the factions. They prepare draft legislation and exercise parliamentary control over their fields of activity. The Chancellery of the ''Riigikogu'' is tasked with servicing the Parliament. It is headed by the Secretary General of the ''Riigikogu'', who is appointed by the Board of the ''Riigikogu''. Legislation is passed by an [[Open ballot system|open]] majority vote. The [[quorum]] for the Parliament is provided in the ''Riigikogu'' Rules of Procedure and Internal Rules Act.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":3\"/>\n\n[[Citizenship|Citizens]] of Estonia who are at least 21 years of age and are eligible to vote may stand to be elected to the Parliament of Estonia. Citizens who are at least 18 years of age and are not convicted of a criminal offence have the right to participate in the voting for the Parliament of Estonia. Elections are called by the President of the Republic. After the election of the Parliament, the first sitting is convened by the President of the Republic, where the members of the Parliament will take an oath of office and then elect the President and Vice Presidents of the Parliament. After the election of the President and Vice Presidents, who are nominated by members of the Parliament, the Prime Minister announces the resignation of the Government so a new one could take its place. The procedure of elections is defined in the ''Riigikogu'' Election Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Head of State ===\n\n{{main|President of Estonia}}\nThe [[President of Estonia|President]] is the [[head of state]] of the Republic of Estonia and serves as the highest representative of the state. Furthermore, the President can have limited participation in legislation by issuing decrees, resolutions and directives. Presidential legislation is administered by the Government of the Republic. In addition, the President can refuse to proclaim a law and return it to the Parliament for review. The President is assisted by the Office of the President, which is managed by the Head of the Office of the President. There are also several institutions under the jurisdiction of the President. These include: President\u2019s Academic Advisory Board, Roundtable on Regional Development, Estonian Memory Institute, Cultural Foundation of the President, Estonian Cooperation Assembly and National Defence Council. The mandate of the President is determined by the President of the Republic Work Procedure Act.<ref name=\":4\"/><ref name=\":5\"/>\n\nThe President is elected by the [[Parliament of Estonia]] for a five-year term, but no more than two terms. If the Parliament does not secure at least two-thirds of the votes after three rounds of balloting, then an Electoral College (made up of the Parliament and representatives of local authority councils) elects the president, choosing between the two candidates with the largest percentage of votes. The President candidate is nominated with at least one-fifth support by members of the Parliament. Candidates have to be citizens of Estonia by birth and at least 40 years of age. The procedure for election of the President is provided in the President of the Republic Election Act. The President of the ''Riigikogu'' can also perform the duties of the President of the Republic in cases outlined in the [[Constitution of Estonia|constitution]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===Government===\n\n{{main|Government of Estonia}}\nThe [[Government of Estonia|Government of the Republic]] ({{lang-et|Vabariigi Valitsus}}) is the [[Executive (government)|executive]] authority of the Republic of Estonia. Its main task is governing the state and implementing policies. It comprises the [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] and ministers, who also serve as representatives in the [[Council of the European Union]]. The Prime Minister is the head of Government who represents the institution and directs its activities. Different areas of government are managed by various [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]], each of which is headed by a minister. Ministries are further divided into departments, divisions and bureaus. The work of the ministry is managed by a secretary general, who is recommended by the minister and appointed by the Government. Executive power is also exercised by executive agencies and inspectorates under the authority of a ministry. The Government of the Republic is assisted by the Government Office, which is led by the [[Secretary_of_state#Estonia|State Secretary]]. The State Secretary is appointed by the Prime Minister. The activities and organisation of the Government is regulated in the Government of the Republic Act.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nAfter the appointment of the Parliament, the Prime Minister candidate is nominated by the President. The Parliament then decides whether to authorise the candidate to form the Government. If approved, the candidate presents a list of members of the Government to the President, who appoints the Government within three days. The Government of the Republic assumes office by taking an oath before the Parliament.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n===Central Bank===\n\n{{main|Bank of Estonia}}\nThe Bank of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eesti Pank}}) is the central bank of the Republic of Estonia. Its mission is to maintain the stability of the Estonian financial system. It administers the circulation of currency, implements monetary policy, advises the Government and reports to the Parliament. However, it operates independently of other national government agencies. It is a member of the [[European System of Central Banks]] and may receive instructions from the [[European Central Bank]]. It is overseen by the Supervisory Board, which includes a Chairman together with seven members. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is recommended by the President and appointed by the Parliament for a term of five years. The Bank of Estonia is headed by the Governor of the Bank of Estonia, who is recommended by the Supervisory Board and appointed by the President for a term of five years, but no more than one consecutive term. The Governor is also the Chairman of the Executive Board, which is responsible for planning and organising the work of the institution. Furthermore, the Governor represents the Republic of Estonia in the Board of Governors of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The Bank of Estonia is governed by strict confidentiality rules regarding banking secrets. The organisation and activities of the Bank of Estonia is regulated by the Bank of Estonia Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":7\"/><ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===National Audit Office===\n\n{{main|National Audit Office of Estonia}}\nThe National Audit Office ({{lang-et|Riigikontroll}}) is an independent public body that carries out audits concerning public spending and assets, including the use of European Union funds. It mainly reports to the Parliament, but can and does share information with the Government and the public. It is headed by the Auditor General, who is recommended by the President and appointed by the Parliament for a term of five years. Every year the Auditor General presents reports about public assets to the Parliament, which are also made public. The National Audit Office has two main departments, the Audit Department and Development and Administrative Service. The Audit Department carries out various audits and the Development and Administrative Service supports its function. The National Audit Office also cooperates with the [[European Court of Auditors]]. The organisation and activities of the National Audit Office is regulated by the National Audit Office Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":9\"/><ref name=\":10\"/>\n\n===Chancellor of Justice===\n\n{{main|Chancellor of Justice (Estonia)}}\nThe Chancellor of Justice ({{lang-et|\u00d5iguskantsler}}) is a public official who is tasked with supervising the conformity of legislation with the [[Constitution of Estonia]] and laws, protecting fundamental rights, performing the functions of the Obudsman for Children and solving discrimination disputes. Anybody can turn to the Chancellor of Justice with issues of fundamental rights and freedoms or conformance of an act or legislation with the constitution or law. Every year a report is presented to the Parliament about the activities of the Chancellor of Justice. If the Chancellor of Justice finds that some legislation is not in conformance with the constitution or law, then it can be sent back to the body that passed it to be brought into conformity. If the legislation is not brought in conformity within 20 days, then the Chancellor of Justice can make a proposal to the Supreme Court to repeal it. The Chancellor of Justice also regularly inspects places of detention to prevent and protect detainees of ill-treatment. The working body of the Chancellor of Justice is the Office of Chancellor of Justice. The Chancellor of Justice is recommended by the President and appointed to office by the Parliament for a term of seven years. The status and the organisation of the office of the Chancellor of Justice is determined by the Chancellor of Justice Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":12\"/>\n\n===Courts===\n\n{{main|Supreme Court of Estonia}}\nCourts form the [[judiciary]] of the Republic of Estonia, which consists of three instances. The first instance courts include county and city courts and administrative courts. Circuit courts are the second instance and review the rulings of the courts of first instance on appeal. The Supreme Court ({{lang-et|Riigikohus}}) is the highest court instance and reviews rulings of other courts upon request for a [[motion to quash]], but also acts as a [[constitutional court]]. The [[Supreme_Court_of_Estonia#Chief_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]] is recommended by the President and appointed by the Parliament. [[Supreme_Court_of_Estonia#Justices|Justices]] of the Supreme Court are recommended by the Chief Justice and appointed by the Parliament. Other judges are recommended by the Supreme Court and appointed to office for life by the President. First and second instance courts are administered by the [[Ministry of Justice (Estonia)|Ministry of Justice]] with the support of Council for Administration of Courts. The Supreme Court administers itself with the aid of self-government bodies. These include: Court ''[[en banc]]'', Council for Administration of Courts, Disciplinary Chamber, Judge's examination committee and Judicial Training Council. First and second order courts are headed by Chairmen, who are elected from among judges for a term of seven years. The organisation of the courts and their rules of procedure are established in the Courts Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n===Local government===\n\nThe local self-government ({{lang-et|Kohalik omavalitsus}}) is the authority responsible for all local matters. They are based on rural municipalities and cities. The local authority is represented by its council, which is elected for a term of four years on free local elections, in conformance with the Municipal Council Election Act. The council can have no less than seven members. The work of the council is managed by the chairman, who is elected from among the members of the council. The executive body of the local authority is the municipal administration (government). The municipal administration is formed and managed by the mayor, who is appointed by the council. The mayor is also tasked with representing the local authority. The council has the right to impose taxes, duties and regulations according to law. These are only valid within the administrative territory of the local government. The council may also decide to form committees, law enforcement units and other administrative agencies. Residents of the municipality have the right to initiate passage, amendment or repeal of legislation of the local authority. Issues in the domain of the council are decided by an open vote. The functions, responsibility and organisation of local governments is determined by the Local Government Organisation Act.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":14\"/>\n\n===Political parties===\n\n{{main|List of political parties in Estonia}}\nEstonia has a [[multi-party system]] in which parties usually need to form [[coalition governments]]. However, some local self-governments have been formed by a single party. Parties gain authority for implementing their policies by participating in local self-government council, state parliament and/or [[European Parliament]] elections. The political landscape is relatively stable, though fractured, and polarization on the left-right scale tends to be fairly weak. Most of the polarization is centered on ethnicity, which is infused with conflict over Estonia's history and identity inherited from the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\":15\"/>\n\nA party is founded by a memorandum of association as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit association]]. It needs to have at least 1000 members and a [[Party platform|platform]] approved by the leadership to be registered. Parties receive funding through donations and from state budget if they are either represented in the state parliament or managed to receive at least one percent of the votes in the elections of the parliament. Funding is reviewed by the political party funding supervision committee, which consists of members appointed for a term of five years by the Chancellor of Justice, Auditor General, National Electoral Committee and political parties represented in the parliament. Any Estonian citizen or a citizen of European Union with permanent residence in Estonia who is at least 18 years old can become a member of a political party. The organisation and activities of political parties is regulated by the Political Parties Act and Non-profit Associations Act.<ref name=\":16\"/>\n\n==Policies==\n\nMandate to implement policies is attained through elections. Political parties determine their program based on their platform and the input of members. Parties that get elected to a position of authority then have a chance to deliberate with other elected parties to decide which policies to implement and how.\n\n===Elections===\n\n[[File:Preliminary elections in Tallinn.JPG|thumb|Preliminary elections to European parliament in Tallinn.]]\n{{main|Elections in Estonia|Electronic voting in Estonia}}\nThere are four types of public elections in Estonia: local government council elections, state parliament elections, [[European Parliament]] elections and referendums. Referendums can be initiated by the Parliament. The rules of procedure for elections are established in the Municipal Council Election Act, ''Riigikogu'' Election Act, European Parliament Election Act and Referendum Act. Elections are overseen by the National Electoral Committee and managed by the State Electoral Office, county heads of elections and voting district committees. Members of the National Electoral Committee, which is established for a term of four years, are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Chancellor of Justice, Auditor General, Chief Public Prosecutor, State Secretary and Board of Auditors. The State Electoral Office is part of the Chancellery of the ''Riigikogu'' and its members are appointed by the Secretary General of the Parliament. It organises electronic voting and supervises the election managers. County heads of elections manage elections in the county by instructing and supervising voting district committees. They are either the county secretary or someone recommended by the country secretary and appointed by the Head of the State Electoral Office. A voting district committee is formed by the municipal council and comprises at least five members, with half of the members being presented by the municipal secretary and half by participating political parties. The activities of the National Electoral Committee and election managers can be observed by everyone.\n\nElectronic voting was first used in Estonia during the municipal council elections of 2005. Since then the share of people voting electronically has continuously risen. Electronic voting is managed by the State Electoral Office, which establishes the technical requirements and organisation of electronic voting. Voting is based on the [[Estonian ID card]]. Every voter has the right to verify and change their vote electronically. If the voter has also voted with a ballot paper, then only the ballot paper will be taken into account.<ref name=\":17\"/><ref name=\":18\"/><ref name=\":19\"/><ref name=\":20\"/>\n\n===Finance and the national budget===\n\n{{main|Economy of Estonia}}\nEstonia operates an [[Developed country|advanced]] [[free-market]] economy, which is integrated into the wider [[Economy of Europe|European economy]] by being part of the [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]]. The Estonian monetary system is managed by the Estonian Central Bank, the national budget is drafted by the Government of the Republic and approved by the Parliament. The draft must be presented to the Parliament at least three months before the beginning of the budget year. The rules for drafting and passage of the state budget is described in the State Budget Act. Financial supervision is provided by the Financial Supervision Authority. It supervises securities market, banks, insurance providers, insurance mediators, investment associations and management companies.<ref name=\":21\"/>\n\nDrafting of the national budget is annually co-ordinated by the Ministry of Finance and supported by other ministries. The ministries prepare plans for at least the next three years and then negotiate the draft budget with the Ministry of Finance, while the Government of the Republic acts as a mediator. After the draft has been finalized by the Government of the Republic, it is then presented to the Parliament for approval. The implementation of the budget is then organized by the Ministry of Finance. Rearrangement of the budget, so that the total revenues and expenses don't change, is passed as amendments, but changes to the total revenues and expenses have to be made through an additional budget. Revenues and expenses are accounted by the State Treasury.<ref name=\":22\"/>\n\nEstonia has one of the lowest national debts in Europe. Part of the reason is because the State Budget Act requires the structural budget position to be in balance. There has also traditionally been a general political consensus over keeping the budget in balance and holding a decent reserve. Estonian economy is frequently rated as one of the freest in the world and maintains a stable international credit rating. High efficiency is provided through an advanced [[internet banking]] system and [[e-governance]].<ref name=\":23\"/><ref name=\":24\"/>\n\n===Foreign relations and international treaties===\n\n{{main|Foreign relations of Estonia}}\nForeign relations are managed mainly by the Parliament, the Government of the Republic (including various ministries) and the President of the Republic, who mostly serves a representative role. The government can enter into international agreements and present them to the parliament for [[ratification]]. Agreements that are in conflict with the Constitution can not be ratified. One notable example of such a case was when Estonia decided to join the European Union, which required the amendment of the Constitution in order to ratify the Accession Treaty. The mandate for the amendment of the Constitution was gained through a [[Estonian European Union membership referendum, 2003|public referendum]].<ref name=\":25\"/>\n\nEstonia's main foreign policy goals are to maintain national security and stability of international relations, ensuring the functioning of Estonian economy, protecting citizens abroad, maintaining good influence and reputation, and promoting democracy, human rights, rule of law and economic freedom. To achieve these goals, Estonia has set its priorities on involvement and integration into the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], and forming strong relations with countries that share its values, especially its close Baltic and Nordic neighbours. Baltic and Nordic cooperation is coordinated through such formats as: Baltic Council of Ministers, Baltic Assembly, Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8), Council of the Baltic Sea States and Nordic Council of Ministers. Estonia is also a member of the [[UN]], [[OECD]], [[OSCE]] and [[WTO]], among others.<ref name=\":26\"/><ref name=\":27\"/>\n\nTreaties can be initiated or concluded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other ministries and the State Chancellery can make proposals on treaties to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then reviews the proposals. If the submission meets requirements, the ministry can then send it to the Government of the Republic for approval. Ratification of treaties is performed by the parliament. The performance of treaties is guaranteed by the Government of the Republic. The procedures pertaining to foreign relations are described in the Foreign Relations Act.<ref name=\":25\"/>\nAfter decades of [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]], Estonia decided to re-establish its independence in 1991. Because the annexation of Estonia was never recognized, and on the basis of the historical continuity of statehood, the state inherited the full responsibility for the rights and obligations of the Republic of Estonia that existed before the occupation. This means, that multilateral treaties, which were approved before the occupation, were considered to be still in effect. Thus, Estonia has re-assumed its international obligations through the restoration of old treaties.<ref name=\":28\"/>\n\n===National defence===\n{{see also|Ministry of Defence (Estonia)|Estonian Defence Forces|Estonian Defence League}}\nEstonias national defence is based on initial self-defence capability and membership in NATO. Estonia's security policy utilizes a broad concept of security, similar to the concept of total defence in several nordic countries, in which all sectors of society are involved.<ref name=\":29\"/> According to the constitution, all citizens of Estonia have a duty to participate in national defence.<ref name=\":1\"/> Male citizens between the ages of 17-27 must partake in 8-12 month military service, though female citizens are also free to serve. Peace-time and war-time organisation of national defence is determined by the National Defence Act.<ref name=\":30\"/>\n\nThe supreme commander of national defence is the President of the Republic. The president is advised by the National Defence Council, which consists of the President of the Parliament, Chairman of the National Defence Committee, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Prime Minister with other ministers and the Commander of the Defence Forces. Planning, development and organisation of national defence is coordinated by the Security Committee of the Government of the Republic. Management of defence readiness, state of emergency and state of war are directed by the Prime Minister. Increase of defence readiness needs to be approved by the parliament. Beginning and end of state of war and mobilisation is proposed by the president and declared by the parliament. In case of aggression against the Republic of Estonia, state of war can be declared by the president without a corresponding resolution from the parliament. Use of the Defence forces in international cooperation is decided by the parliament.<ref name=\":31\"/> The activities of the Defence Forces are directed and organised by the [[Commander of the Estonian Defence Forces]].<ref name=\":32\"/>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00291951.2010.502441 | issn = 0029-1951 | volume = 64 | issue = 3

Products such as butter, milk and cheese were widely known on the [[West Europe|western European]] markets. The main markets were Germany and the United Kingdom, and only 3% of all commerce was with the neighbouring [[USSR]].\n\nThe USSR's [[Estonian SSR|annexation of Estonia]] in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during World War II crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war [[Sovietization]] of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the [[USSR]]'s centrally planned structure. Before the war, Estonia and [[Finland]] had a relatively similar standard of living. Estonia's 1990 per capita GDP was $10,733 compared<ref name=\"maddison185\">{{Harvnb|Maddison|2006|p=185}}</ref> to $26,100 for Finland.\n\nAfter Estonia moved away from Communism in the late 1980s and became an independent capitalist economy in 1991, it emerged as a pioneer of the global economy. In 1994, it became one of the first countries in the world to adopt a [[flat tax]], with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. Between 2005 and 2008, the personal income tax rate was reduced from 26% to 21% in several steps. Estonia received more foreign investment per capita in the second half of the 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"heritage\">{{cite web |last=Laar |first=Mart |title=The Estonian Economic Miracle |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=7 August 2007 |url= http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg2060.cfm |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe country has been quickly catching up with the [[EU-15]]; its GDP per capita having grown from 34.8% of the EU-15 average in 1996 to 65% in 2007, similar to that of Central European countries.<ref name=\"heritage\"/> It is already rated a high-income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]. The [[Purchasing power parity|GDP (PPP) per capita]] of the country, a good indicator of wealth, was $23,631 in 2012 according to the World Bank,<ref>{{cite web |title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) |publisher=[[World Bank]] |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD |accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> between that of [[Portugal]] and Lithuania, but below that of long-time EU members such as [[Greece]] or [[Spain]]. Because of its economic performance after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet breakup]], Estonia has been termed one of the [[Baltic Tiger]]s.\n\nIn 2008, Estonia was ranked 12th of 162 countries in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]] 2008, the best of any former Soviet republic.

Estonia had the EU's worst year for unemployment, which rose from 3.9% in May 2008 to 15.6% in May 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zumbrun |first=Joshua |title=In Pictures: The World's Hardest-Hit Economies |work=Forbes |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/economics-iceland-ireland-business-beltway-countries_slide_4.html}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, long-term prospects for the Estonian economy remain among the most promising in Europe. In 2011, the real GDP growth in Estonia was 8.0%, and according to the projections made by the [[Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales|CEPII]], by 2025 the GDP per capita could rise to the level of Nordic economies of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Norway. According to the same projections, by 2050, Estonia could become the most productive country in the EU, after Luxembourg, and thus join the top five most productive nations in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Shift: Macroeconomic projections for the world economy at the 2050 horizon |publisher=[[Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales|CEPII]] |location=France |date=February 2012 |url= http://www.cepii.fr/anglaisgraph/workpap/pdf/2012/wp2012-03.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nUntil the early 13th century, the territory that is now known as Estonia was independent. The economy was largely an agricultural one, but Estonia being a country with a long coastline, there were also many maritime activities. Autonomous development was brought to an end by the [[Northern Crusades]] undertaken by the King of Denmark, the German Livonian and the Teutonic military orders. The Estonian world was transformed by military conquest. The war against the invaders lasted from 1208\u20131227. The last Estonian county to fall was the island of Saaremaa in 1261.\n\nThereafter, through many centuries until [[World War I|WWI]], Estonian agriculture consisted of native peasants working large feudal-type estates held by ethnic [[Baltic Germans|German]] [[landlord]]s. In the decades prior to independence, centralised [[Czar]]ist rule had created a rather large industrial sector dominated by the [[Kreenholm Manufacturing Company]], then the world's largest [[cotton mill]].\n\nAfter declaring independence in 1918, the [[Estonian War of Independence]] and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, the new Estonian state inherited a ruined post-war economy and an inflated ruble currency. Despite considerable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first decade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist ruble was replaced by the [[Estonian mark]], which was in circulation until 1927. By 1929, a stable currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]], had been established. It was issued by the [[Bank of Estonia]], the country's [[central bank]]. Compensating the German landowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and divided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian prosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the [[USSR]].\n\nThe USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during [[World War II]] crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war Sovietisation of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure. More than 56% of Estonian farms were [[collective|collectivised]] in the month of April 1949 alone. Moscow expanded on those Estonian industries which had locally available raw materials, such as [[oil shale]] mining and phosphorites.\n\n==Modernisation and liberalisation==\n[[File:Tln1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Maakri]] has become the [[Central business district]] of Tallinn in the 21st century]]\nSince reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued economic reform and integration with the West. Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former [[COMECON]] area. A balanced budget, almost non-existent [[public debt]], flat-rate [[income tax]], [[free trade]] regime, fully convertible currency backed by [[currency board]] and a strong peg to the [[euro]], competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign investment, innovative [[e-Services]] and even mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's free-market-based economy. Estonia also has made excellent progress in regard to [[structural adjustment]].\n\nIn June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] with its own freely convertible currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]] (EEK). A [[currency board]] was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate of 8 Estonian kroons for 1 [[Deutsche Mark]]. When Germany introduced the [[euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro. Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008 but due to high inflation rates the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th [[eurozone]] member state.<ref name=\"reuters-2011-01-01\"/>\n\nThe [[privatisation]] of state-owned firms is virtually complete, with only the port and the main power plants remaining in government hands. The constitution requires a balanced budget, and the protection afforded by Estonia's intellectual property laws is on a par of that of Europe's. In early 1992 both liquidity problems and structural weakness stemming from the communist era precipitated a banking crisis. As a result, effective bankruptcy legislation was enacted and privately owned, well-managed banks emerged as market leaders. Today, near-ideal conditions for the banking sector exist. Foreigners are not restricted from buying bank shares or acquiring majority holdings.\n\n[[Tallinn]]'s fully electronic [[Tallinn Stock Exchange|stock exchange]] opened in early 1996 and was bought out by Finland's [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]] in 2001.\n\n==The economy today==\n{{Update|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002-2012.png|thumb|300px|Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002-2012.]]\n\nFrom the early 2000s to the latter part of that decade, the Estonian economy experienced considerable growth. \n\nIn the year 2000, Estonian GDP grew by 6.4%, and, upon accession to the [[EU]] in 2004, double digit growth was soon after observed. GDP grew by 7.9% in 2007 alone. Increases in labor costs, the imposition of tax on tobacco, alcohol, electricity, fuel, gas, and other external pressures (growing prices of oil and food on the global market) were expected to inflate price levels by 10% in the first months of 2009.\n\nIn the first quarter 2008, GDP grew only 0.1%. The government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by the [[Riigikogu]]. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1 billion and the expenditure by EEK 3.2 billion.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title      = Government approves supplementary budget for 2008\n | publisher  = Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia\n | date       = 15 May 2008\n | url        = http://www.fin.ee/?id=80290\n | accessdate = 21 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\nEstonia joined the World Trade Organization in 1999. A sizable current account deficits remains, but started to shrink in the last months of 2008 and is expected to do so in the near future.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2013, the average monthly gross wage in Estonia was \u20ac976 (15,271 [[Estonian kroon|kroons]], US$1,328).<ref name=\"stat.ee\">\n{{cite web\n | title      = Most requested statistics\n | work       = Main indicators\n | publisher  = [[Statistics Estonia]]\n | date       = 30 September 2013\n | url        = http://www.stat.ee/main-indicators\n | accessdate = 4 October 2013}}\n</ref>\n\nEstonia is nearly energy independent, supplying over 90% of its electricity needs with [[Oil shale in Estonia|locally mined oil shale]]. Alternative energy sources such as wood, peat, and biomass make up approximately 9% of primary energy production. Estonia imports needed petroleum products from western Europe and Russia. Oil shale energy, telecommunications, textiles, chemical products, banking, services, food and fishing, timber, shipbuilding, electronics, and transportation are key sectors of the economy. The [[ice-free port]] of [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]], near [[Tallinn]], is a modern facility featuring good transshipment capability, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill/frozen storage, and brand-new oil tanker off-loading capabilities. The railroad serves as a conduit between the West, Russia, and other points to the East.\n\nAfter a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased by a little over 3% on a yearly basis in the 3rd quarter of 2008. In the 4th quarter of 2008 the negative growth was already \u22129.4%. Some{{Who|date=August 2009}} international experts and journalists, who like to view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, have failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] on many fundamental indicators.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Still, in 2009 Estonia was one of the five worst performing economies in the world in terms of annual GDP growth rate.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title      = Country Comparison \u2013 National product real growth rate\n | work       = The World Factbook\n | publisher  = [[CIA]]\n | date       = 2009 estimate\n | url        = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html?countryName=Estonia&countryCode=en&regionCode=eu&rank=209#en\n | accessdate = 26 April 2010}}\n</ref> The current account deficit and inflation is lower than in Latvia, the GDP per capita is higher than in Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia's public debt is a very low 3.8% of GDP and government reserves are close to 10% of GDP.

The government recently greatly increased its spending on innovation. The prime minister from the [[Estonian Reform Party]] has stated its goal of bringing Estonian [[GDP per capita]] into the top 5 of the EU by 2022. However, the GDP of Estonia decreased by 1.4% in the 2nd quarter of 2008, over 3% in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and over 9% in the 4th quarter of 2008.

In the process of privatization, a concession was granted to liberalize mobile, CATV and packet-switched telecommunications.  This concession was critical for developing a competitive market. Three licensed mobile operators encouraged one of the highest rates of mobile telephony penetration in the world.  CATV licenses were granted at a local level, and while it was a more natural monopoly, pirate operators proliferated within populous cities in the 1990s.  \n\nInternet penetration blossomed. Beginning with a satellite link and widespread undersea leased line connectivity, Estonia connected with the rest of the world. The concession for packet communications, perhaps against the constraint of limited international telephony competition (with the global exceptions of [[callback (telecommunications)|callback]], [[Internet transit|transit]] and [[re-file]] arbitrage) -- created conditions in which [[Skype]] was natively created.\n\nWith a population of about 1.3 million, Estonia had in 2012 about 2.07 million cellular telephones and 0.45 million fixed phones. In 2009 it had about 0.97 million internet users.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Internet in Estonia]]\n\n== References ==\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/en.html CIA World Factbook]\n\n{{Estonia topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications by country|Estonia]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in Estonia| ]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in Europe|Estonia]]\n\n\n{{Estonia-stub}}\n{{comm-stub}}", "sha1": "ny9cat8ecp4jki5oghk39irfxecgooa"}}, {"title": "Transport in Estonia", "ns": "0", "id": "9393", "revision": {"id": "852060350", "parentid": "770010142", "timestamp": "2018-07-26T10:54:21Z", "contributor": {"ip": "80.235.96.58"}, "comment": "/* Light rail */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Transport in Estonia''' relies mainly on road and rail networks.\n\n== Roads ==\n[[File:Main roads of Estonia.svg|thumb|250px|Estonian main and E-roads]]\n*total: 57,565&nbsp;km (including 16,465 of national roads)\n*paved: 12,926&nbsp;km (including 99&nbsp;km of [[limited-access road]]s)\n\n===National roads===\n{{main|Highways in Estonia}}\nNational roads form the core of Estonian road network.

The first line was electrified on October 28, 1925. The first electric trams were built by Dvigatel, Ltd., in Tallinn before [[World War II]] and for some years after that, the last one in 1954. In the 1920s and 1930s gas-powered trams were also used. Since 1955 to 1988 [[Germany|German]]-built trams were used. In total, there were 20 LOWA T54-B54 trams (in use from February 1955 to March 1977), 11 Gotha T57-B57 (in use from January 1958 to June 1978), 5 Gotha T59E-B59E (in use from June 1960 to February 1980), 14 Gotha T2-62 and B2-62 (in use from 1962 to 1981) and 50 Gotha G4 trams (in use from January 1965 to October 1988) trams. The first [[Czechoslovakia]]n-built [[\u010cKD Tatra]] T4SU arrived in 1973. The T4SU trams were in use from May 1973 to September 2005 and there were 60 of them. The first [[Tatra KT4|KT4SU]] arrived in Tallinn in 1981 and was first in use on March 10, 1981. In 2007, there are 56 KT4SU, 12 [[Tatra KTNF6|KTNF6]] (rebuilt KT4SUs, 10 local, one from [[Gera]] and one from [[Erfurt]]) and 23 KT4D (12 from Gera, 6 from [[Cottbus]], 1 from [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and 5 from Erfurt) in use.

The forcible incorporation of Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940 was not generally recognised by the international community and the [[Estonian diplomatic service]] continued to operate in some countries. Following the restoration of independence from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]] was one of the first nations to re-recognize [[Estonia]]'s independence (the first country to do so was [[Iceland]] on 22 August 1991). Estonia's immediate priority after regaining its independence was the withdrawal of [[Russia]]n (formerly Soviet) forces from Estonian territory. In August 1994, this was completed. However, relations with Moscow have remained strained primarily because [[Russia]] decided not to ratify the border treaty it had signed with Estonia in 1999.\n\n==Trends following re-independence==\nSince regaining independence, Estonia has pursued a foreign policy of close cooperation with Western European nations. [[Image:GW Bush, TH Ilves 2006-2.jpg|thumb|270px|left|President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] and President [[George W. Bush]], in Estonia 2006.]] The two most important policy objectives in this regard have been accession into [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], achieved in March and May 2004 respectively. Estonia's international realignment toward the West has been accompanied by a general deterioration in relations with [[Russia]], most recently demonstrated by the controversy surrounding relocation of the [[Bronze Soldier]] WWII memorial in Tallinn.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6604647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Estonia blames Russia for unrest | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>  Estonia has become an increasingly strong supporter of deepening European integration.

The annexed land had been within the borders Estonia approved by Russia in the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|1920 Tartu Peace Treaty]]. However, the [[Boris Yeltsin]] government disavowed any responsibility for acts committed by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAfter signing the border treaty by the corresponding foreign minister in 2005, it was ratified by the Estonian government and president. The Russian side interpreted the preamble as giving Estonia a possibility for future territorial claim, and [[Vladimir Putin]] notified Estonia that Russia will not consider these. Negotiations were reopened in 2012 and the Treaty was signed in February 2014. Ratification is still pending.<ref>[http://news.postimees.ee/1250918/estonia-russia-to-exchange-128-6-hectares-of-land-under-border-treaty Postimees]</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic relationships==\n[[File:FM Javad Zarif meets with Estonian FM Marina Kaljurand 02.jpg|thumb|Estonia foreign minister [[Marina Kaljurand]] meeting [[Iran]]ian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]], 12 April 2016]]\nEstonia established diplomatic relations with Kazakhstan on 27 May 1992.

legal framework of relations between Ukraine and Estonia covers a wide range of branches of bilateral cooperation, including political, trade and economic, scientific and technical, humanitarian, law enforcement and other spheres. This base is ramified and efficient enough and includes 53 bilateral documents, among which are 3 interstate agreements, 15 intergovernmental and 35 interdepartmental.\n\nUkraine and Estonia bring together common aspirations in the political, economic, social and other spheres. Recognizing Ukraine as its foreign policy priority, Estonia is one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine's European choice, supported the signing of the Agreement on the Association of Ukraine with the EU.\n\nIntensive bilateral contacts between state and non-governmental institutions are developing, and interaction within the framework of international organizations is active. At the state level, the important role played by Ukraine in ensuring stability and security in Europe is constantly stressed. Estonia supports political and socio-economic reforms in Ukraine, provides substantial humanitarian, financial and advisory and technical assistance.\n\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United Arab Emirates}}||<!--Date started--> {{dts|format=dmy|2006-03-28}}<ref>[http://vm.ee/en/countries/united-arab-emirates?display=relations]</ref>\n|\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United Kingdom }}||<!--Data started-->{{dts|format=dmy|1921-02-05}}\n|See [[Estonia\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n* Estonia has an embassy in [[London]] and honorary consulates in [[Aberdeen]], [[Belfast]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leeds]], [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and [[Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://london.mfa.ee/estonian-honorary-consuls-in-the-united-kingdom/|title=Estonian Honorary Consuls in the United Kingdom \u2013 Embassy of Estonia London|website=london.mfa.ee|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n* The United Kingdom has an embassy in Tallinn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukinestonia.fco.gov.uk/en/|title=UK and Estonia|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n* Both countries are now full members of NATO and of the European Union.\n* [[Majesty|HM]] Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] paid a [[state visit]] to Estonia in October 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title= OUTWARD STATE VISITS MADE BY THE QUEEN SINCE 1952|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4869.asp|publisher= Official web site of the British Monarchy|accessdate=29 November 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Prince Harry]] also made a state visit in May 2014 and paid tribute to Estonia's war dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27447952|title=BBC News - Prince Harry pays tribute to Estonia's soldiers during visit|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080430024605/http://www.vm.ee/eng/kat_176/1200.html  Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about relations with the United Kingdom]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080410023643/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/europe/estonia  British Foreign and Commonwealth Office about relations with Estonia]\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United States }}||<!--Data started-->{{dts|format=dmy|1922-07-22}}||See [[Estonia\u2013United States relations]]\n* Estonia has an embassy in [[Washington, DC]] and a consulate-general in [[New York City|New York]].<ref>[http://www.estemb.org Embassy of Estonia in Washington, DC]</ref>\n* The United States has an embassy in Tallinn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://estonia.usembassy.gov/ |title=Embassy of the United States in Tallinn |access-date=18 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924011050/http://estonia.usembassy.gov/ |archive-date=24 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Uzbekistan}}||<!--Date started--> {{dts|format=dmy|1994-10-10}}<ref>[http://vm.ee/en/countries/uzbekistan?display=relations]</ref>\n|\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Estonia]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Estonia]]\n* [[List of ambassadors to Estonia]]\n* [[Visa requirements for Estonian citizens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Estonia topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Estonian foreign relations}}\n{{Foreign relations of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Estonia| ]]", "sha1": "fq6nqa5anrrm3us5k0bfkwfngbtlcvq"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Ethiopia", "ns": "0", "id": "9400", "revision": {"id": "862000870", "parentid": "862000789", "timestamp": "2018-10-01T14:41:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Maximajorian Viridio", "id": "32762897"}, "comment": "/* Languages */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "<!-- Per convention, please leave the page layout as is, with the main info on the country's ethnic groups at the top, and the statistical summary data below it. -->\n{{Infobox country demographics\n|country              = Ethiopia\n|image\n|caption              = \n|size_of_population   = 100,613,986 (2017 est.)([[List of countries by population|14th]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211418/http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/nationalstatisticsabstract/2012/2012+POPULATION.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=23 September 2015|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n|Density              = 78.4 people per.sq.km (2013 est.)\n|growth               = 2.9% (2013 est.)

Most people in Ethiopia speak [[Afroasiatic languages]], mainly of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] or [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches. Among these are the [[Oromo people|Oromo]], [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Somalis|Somali]] and [[Tigrayans]], who together constitute around three-quarters of the population.\n\n[[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic minorities also inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas bordering [[South Sudan]]. Among these are the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Anuak people|Anuak]].\n\n==Languages==\n{{main article|Languages of Ethiopia}}\nEthiopia, like most countries in Africa, is a multi-ethnic state. Although the original physical differences between the major ethnic groups have been blurred by centuries, if not millennia, of intermarriage, there remain many who are distinct and unique.\n\nEthnic differences may also be observed from the great variety of languages spoken in the country, of which there are an astonishing eighty-three, with 200 dialects. These can be broken into four main groups: Semitic, Cushitic, Omotic, and Nilo-Saharan.\n\nThe Semitic languages of Ethiopia are related to both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]]. The Ethiopian languages of this family are derived from Ge'ez, the language of the ancient Axumite kingdom, which was also the language of the country's literature prior to the mid-nineteenth century, as well as parts of most present-day church services.\n\nEthiopia's Semitic languages are today spoken mainly in the north and centre of the country. The most important of them in the north is Tigrinya, which is used throughout Tigray.\n\nThe principal Semitic language of the north-western and centre of the country is Amharic, which is the language of Gondar and Gojjam, as well as much of Wollo and Shewa. Moreover, Amharic is also the official language of administration, and the language of much modern Ethiopian literature.\n\nTwo other Semitic languages are spoken to the south and east of Addis Ababa: Guraginya, used by the Gurage in a cluster of areas to the south of the capital, and Adarinya, a tongue current only within the old walled city of Harar and used by the Adare, also known as Harrari, people.\n\nThe Cushitic languages, which are less closely related than the Semitic, are found mainly in the south of the country. The most important tongue in this group is Afan Oromo. It is used in a wide stretch of country, including Welega and parts of Ilubabor in the west, Wollo in the north, Shewa and Arsi in the centre, Bale and Sidamo in the south, and Harerge in the east.\n\nOther Cushitic language in the area comprise Somalinya, which is spoken by the Somali in the Ogaden to the east, as well as in the neighboring Somali Republic and part of Djibouti, and the Sidaminya language, used in part of the Sidama region. Cushitic languages, however, are also used in the north of the country, namely Afarinya, spoken by the Afar of eastern Wollo and the northern half of the Djibouti Republic; Saho, in parts of Tigray; and Agawinya, in small pockets in different parts of western Ethiopia.\n\nThe Omotic group of languages, which comprise considerably fewer speakers than either the Semitic or the Cushitic, are spoken the south-west of the country, mainly in Gamo Gofa. They have been given the name in recent years because they are spoken in the general area of the Omo River.\n\nThe Nilo-Saharan languages, largely peripheral to Ethiopian civilization, are spoken in a wide arc of the country towards the Sudan frontier. They include, from north to south, Gumuz in Gondar and Gojjam, Berta in Welega, and Anuak in Ilubabor\n\n==Religion==\n{{main article|Religion in Ethiopia}}\nVarious religions are adhered to in Ethiopia. Most [[Christianity in Ethiopia|Christian]]s live in the [[Ethiopian highlands|highlands]], whereas [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]]s mainly inhabit the [[lowland]]s. Adherents of [[Traditional African religions|traditional faiths]] are primarily concentrated in the southern regions.\n\nAccording to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2007 census), the national religious composition is [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] 43.5%, [[Protestantism in Ethiopia|Protestantism]] 18.6%, [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Roman Catholicism]] 0.7%, [[Islam in Ethiopia|Islam]] 33.9%, [[Traditional African religion|traditional]] 2.6%, and [[Religion in Ethiopia|others]] 0.6%.<ref name=\"Census-2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=14 February 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=27 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214000000/http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf|archivedate=14 February 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical population\n|align       = left\n|shading     = off\n|percentages = pagr\n|2011 |85555555\n|2012 |84320987\n|2013 |86613986\n\n}}{{Clear}}\nSource: [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] (CSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/2013-02-20-13-43-35/national-statistics-abstract/141-population |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505015335/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/2013-02-20-13-43-35/national-statistics-abstract/141-population |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }} </ref>\n\n===UN estimates===\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}}, the total population was {{UN_Population|Ethiopia}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to 18,434,000 in 1950.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in the [[Parliament of Ethiopia|Parliament]]. The [[Judiciary]] is more or less independent of the executive and the legislature. There are 9 ethnically based [[Regions of Ethiopia|administrative regions]] and two self-governing administrations; the capital city [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]].\n\nThe [[president of Ethiopia]] is elected by the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] for a six-year term. The prime minister is chosen by the parliament. The prime minister is designated by the party in power following legislative elections. The Council of Ministers, according to the [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|1995 constitution]], is comprised by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers, various Ministers and other members as determined and approved by the House of Peoples' Representatives. At the current time, this includes the 20 members of [[Council of Ministers of Ethiopia|Council of Ministers]].\n\nThe [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly]] has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]: the [[House of People's Representatives|Council of People's Representatives]] (''Yehizbtewekayoch Mekir Bet'') with 547 members, elected for five-year terms in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]; and the [[House of Federation|Council of the Federation]] (''Yefedereshn Mekir Bet'') with 110 members, one for each [[Demographics of Ethiopia|nationality]], and one additional representative for each one million of its population, designated by the regional councils, which may elect them themselves or through popular elections.\n\nThe president and vice president of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia|Federal Supreme Court]] are recommended by the prime minister and appointed by the House of People's Representatives; for other federal judges, the prime minister submits candidates selected by the Federal Judicial Administrative Council to the People's Representatives for appointment.\n\n==Recent history==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n{{main article|History of Ethiopia}}\nIn May 1991, a coalition of rebel forces under the name [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) [[Ethiopian Civil War#Conclusion|overthrew]] the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|dictatorship]] of [[President of Ethiopia|President]] [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].<ref name=\"Young 1997 197\">Young, p. 197</ref> In July 1991, the TPLF, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF), [Oromo Peoples Democratic Organization] (OPDO), [Amhara National Democratic Movement] (ANDM) and others established the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]] (TGE), which consisted of an 87-member Council of Representatives guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution. Since 1991, Ethiopia has established warm relations with the United States and western Europe and has sought substantial economic aid from Western countries and the [[World Bank]].\n\nIn June 1992 the OLF withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the [[Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition]] left the government. The [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF), an ally in the fight against  the Mengistu regime, assumed control of [[Eritrea]] and established a provisional government.  Eritrea achieved full independence on May 24, 1993.\n\nPresident [[Meles Zenawi]] and members of the TGE pledged to oversee the formation of a multi-party democracy. The first election for Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly was held in June 1994. This assembly adopted the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties would have been able to participate had they chosen to do so.\n\nThe Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was installed in August 1995. The first President was [[Negasso Gidada]]. The EPRDF-led government of Prime Minister Meles has promoted a policy of [[ethnic federalism]], seemingly devolving significant powers to regional, ethnically based authorities. Ethiopia today has nine semi-autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia]] that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues.\n\nIn 2004, the government began a [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettlement initiative]] to move more than two million people away from the arid highlands of the east, proposing that these resettlements would reduce food shortages.<ref name=\"resettlement\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/3640227.stm|title=In Pictures: Ethiopia's great resettlement|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2004-04-22|accessdate=2007-04-26 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe incumbent President is [[Mulatu Teshome]] and has been at that position since October 2013. The ruling party, EPRDF was declared winner by the election board in 2000, and then again in 2005 amidst protests and riots that led to the death of many Ethiopians.

This is due to many factors. For example, the roads are poorly maintained, lightened and marked; which are major factors in road accidents. Another major factor is the people themselves, who ignore the rules of the road. Their disregard of road safety puts every other driver at risk. Due to this, foreigners are advised to keep a safe distance from the car in front of them because the driving is unpredictable; anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Even the surroundings involving transport can be incredibly dangerous. For example, there are instances when carjackings and robberies occur on highways or streets that are away from the public eye. Due to this, people are forced to be highly alert of their surroundings, such as checking to make sure no one is lurking around their vehicle before entering and avoiding nighttime travel.<ref>https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17028</ref>\n\n== Ports and harbours ==\n[[File:Adama (6).jpg|thumb|''Modjo dry port'']]\nEthiopia is [[list of landlocked countries|landlocked]] and was by agreement with [[Eritrea]] using the ports of [[Asseb]] and [[Massawa]] until 1997; since the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]], Ethiopia has used the port of [[Djibouti]] for nearly all of its imports.

Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics, and has been subject to foreign invasion and aggression.

The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine.\nYou see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle.\nDespite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage.\"<ref name=\"samizdat.com\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.\n\n===Under Haile Selassie I===\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]\n{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nModernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers.

The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of forces from the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

With significant Soviet assistance, after that point force sizes grew rapidly.\n\n==Seizure of power by the Derg 1974 and aftermath==\nThe Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the Derg ([[Amharic language|Amharic]] \"Committee\"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers to maintain law and order due to the powerlessness of the civilian government following widespread [[mutiny]] in the armed forces of Ethiopia earlier that year. Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>\n\nThe Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, \"senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.\"<ref name=\"Bahru-234\">Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>\n\nThe committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] that toppled Ethiopian former military dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in 1991 and also by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977\u20131978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>\n\nThe Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974\u20131987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987\u20131991), especially during the latter regime. Gebru Tareke describes the organization of the Ethiopian military in early 1990, a year before Mengistu fled the country:\n: Ethiopian ground forces comprised four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades&nbsp;&ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans&nbsp;&ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref>\n\nEstimated forces under arms increased dramatically:<ref name=\"ETHIOPIA-ARMY-LOC\"/>\n* 1974: 41,000 (Ethiopian Revolution)\n* 1977: 53,500 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1979: 65,000\n* 1991: 230,000 (overthrow of Mengistu)\n\nCuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:<ref name=\"ETHIOPIA-CUBA\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+et0178) Ethiopia: Cuba] [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies</ref>\n* 1977\u20131978: 17,000 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1978: 12,000\n* 1984: 3,000\n* 1989: All forces withdrawn\n\n===1991 Order of Battle===\n\nBy 1991, the Ethiopian army under the Mengistu government had grown in size, but the regime was overcome by the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ, former [[EPLF]]), [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF) and other opposition factions during a decades-long civil war. Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members. The mechanized forces of the army comprised 1,200 [[T-54/55]], 100 [[T-62]] tanks, and 1,100 [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs), but readiness was estimated to be only about 30 percent operational, because of the withdrawal of financial support, lack of maintenance expertise and parts from the Soviet Union, Cuba and other nations.<ref name=\"ETHIOPIA-ARMY-LOC\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+et0167) Ethiopia: Army] [[Library of Congress]] Country Studies</ref>\n[[Image:T-55s civil war.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ethiopian [[T-62]] tanks at the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].]]\nThe army commands consisted of the following:\n\n* First Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Harar]])\n* Second Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Asmera]])\n* Third Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Kombolcha]])\n* Fourth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Nekemte]])\n* Fifth Revolutionary Army (headquartered at [[Gondar]])\n\nTo these armies were assigned the operational forces of the army, comprising:\n\n* 31 [[infantry]] [[Division (military)|division]]s\n* 32 [[tank]] [[battalion]]s\n* 40 [[artillery]] [[battalion]]s\n* 12 [[air defence]] [[battalion]]s\n* 8 [[commando]] [[brigade]]s\n\n===From 1991===\nAfter the defeat of the military government in 1991, the provisional government disbanded the former national army and relied on its own guerrilla fighters for national security.<ref name=LOCEth2005>Library of Congress Federal Research Division, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf Country Profile: Ethiopia, April 2005], accessed July 2012</ref> In 1993, however, the Tigrayan-led government announced plans to create a multi-ethnic defence force. This process entailed the creation of a new professional army and officer class and the demobilization of many of the irregulars who had fought against the military government. With the collapse of the Soviet Union Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. However, many Tigrayan officers remained in command positions. This transformation was still underway when war with [[Eritrea]] broke out in 1998, a development that saw the ranks of the armed forces swell along with defense expenditures.\n\nAlthough the armed forces have significant battlefield experience, their militia orientation has complicated the transition to a structured, integrated military.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> Ranks and conventional units were only adopted in 1996. A United States-assisted effort to restructure the armed forces was interrupted by mobilisation for the war with Eritrea.\n\n====The Ethiopia-Eritrea war====\n[[Image:Afrimil-ethiopiansoldier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Soldier of Ethiopian National Defense Force, 2006.]]\nThe former allies EPRDF and PFDJ (former EPLF) led their countries Ethiopia and Eritrea, respectively, into the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] of 1998.  The war was fought over the disputed region of [[Badme]]. During the course of the war, some commanders and pilots from the former army and air force were recalled to duty. These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |title=Recent Additions |publisher= |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130110233/http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side&nbsp;&ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side&nbsp;&ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]].

In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].\n\n[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Peacekeeping==\n\nEthiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions.

Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nEthiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea. Thus, raw numbers alone will probably overstate the capacity of the ENDF.\n\n===Modern ground forces equipment===\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Despite the efforts of his successor Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] to establish a relationship with the United Kingdom, Ethiopia was ignored by the world powers until the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], and more important, the [[Mahdist War]], drew outside attention to her once more.<ref>Although Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), believes that the Suez Canal brought strategic value to the Red Sea region (p. 73), Sven Rubenson, ''The Survival of Ethiopian Independence'' (Hollywood: Tsehai,1991) argues that only with the Mahdi War did the United Kingdom  interest themselves once again in Ethiopia (pp. 283ff).</ref>\n\nThe same major interests that Tewodros had\u2014the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders and modernization\u2014were once again foremost, as demonstrated by the outcome of the [[First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]], Ethiopia's admission to the [[League of Nations]] (28 September 1923), and the 1935 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. Following the decisive Ethiopian victory at [[battle of Adwa|Adwa]], [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] rapidly negotiated a series of treaties fixing Ethiopia's boundaries\u2014with French Somaliland in March 1897, British Somaliland a few months later in June 1897, with Italian Eritrea in 1900, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1902, British East Africa in 1907, and Italian Somaliland in 1908\u2014which simplified this problem on one level. Although Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] agreed to [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement|an agreement]] with the British government to help him restore order to Ethiopia, which benefited him in crushing the [[Woyane|Woyane Rebellion]], he worked to its eventual termination.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Ethiopia played an active role in regional and global politics. Ethiopia was a [[charter member]] of the [[United Nations]] and took part in UN operations in [[Korea]] in 1951 and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1960. Former [[Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie I]] was also among the founders of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), and served as one of a series of rotating OAU chairmen. Although nominally a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], after the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia also moved into a close relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies and supported their international policies and positions until a change of government in 1991.\n\nToday, Ethiopia is a major economic partner of [[Djibouti]] and [[Sudan]], although border demarcation negotiations are still ongoing with the [[Omar Al-Bashir]] administration. Relations with [[Somalia]] have also gradually improved, particularly since the establishment of a new government in [[Mogadishu]]. Ethiopia's dealings with [[Eritrea]] are extremely tense due to an ongoing border dispute between the two countries.\n\nThe Ethiopian government's [[Ethiopia-United States relations|relations with the U.S.]] and the West in general have been centered on military and economic cooperation. In addition, Ethiopia maintains diplomatic links with [[China]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]] and [[India]], among other countries. [[Addis Ababa]] also serves as the headquarters of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] (UNECA) and the [[African Union]], as well as numerous other continental and international organizations.\n\n==Africa==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Djibouti  }}||<!--Date started-->\n|\nDiplomatic relations between Ethiopia and [[Djibouti]] were established in 1984.<ref name=\"MFA-Dj\">[http://mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php \"Ethiopia - Djibouti relations\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325095640/http://mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php |date=25 March 2012 }}, Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (Retrieved 9 October 2009)</ref> The border between the two countries is based on the Franco-Ethiopian convention of 20 March 1897, which was later finalized in a protocol dated 16 January 1954 and rendered effective on 28 February of that year.<ref>[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS154.pdf \"Djibouti \u2013 Ethiopia Boundary\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109115403/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS154.pdf |date=9 November 2013 }}, U.S. Department of State, International Boundary Study No. 154 \u2013 20 February 1976</ref> In October 1991, the Ethiopian and Djiboutian governments signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation further solidifying relations.

The island officially became a possession of [[France]] in [[1897]]. \n\nThe island, garrisoned by a detachment from [[R\u00e9union]], has a [[weather station]] and is visited by scientists.

Its vegetation consists of dry forest, scrub, [[Euphorbia]], the mangrove swamp, and the remains of a [[sisal]] plantation.  It is one of the world's largest nesting sites for [[green sea turtle]]s. It is also home to [[goat]]s introduced by settlers in the late 18th century.\n\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports a large and diverse population of breeding [[seabird]]s and other [[waterbird]]s.  It is the only known breeding site outside [[Aldabra]] and Madagascar for [[Malagasy pond heron]]s. Seabirds include the second largest colony in the western Indian Ocean of [[great frigatebird]]s (with up to 1100 pairs), [[Audubon's shearwater]]s (up to 100 pairs, probably of the subspecies ''Puffinus lherminieri bailloni'' previously considered endemic to the Mascarene Islands), [[dimorphic egret]]s and [[Caspian tern]]s.  \n\nThe island is also home to an endemic subspecies of [[white-tailed tropicbird]] (''Phaethon lepturus europae'').  There are three species of landbirds present, one of which is an endemic subspecies of the [[Malagasy white-eye]] (''Zosterops maderaspatanus voeltzkowi'').<ref>BirdLife International. (2012).

[[Archimedes]]&nbsp;\u2013 using a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] to draw a geometric construction.]]\n{{General geometry |branches}}\n\n'''Euclidean geometry''' is a mathematical system attributed to [[Alexandria]]n [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]], which he described in his textbook on [[geometry]]: the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [[axiom]]s, and deducing many other [[proposition]]s ([[theorem]]s) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,<ref name = eves1_19>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 19}}</ref> Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive [[deductive]] and [[logical system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 10}}</ref> The ''Elements'' begins with plane geometry, still taught in [[secondary school]] (High School) as the first [[axiomatic system]] and the first examples of [[Mathematical proof|formal proof]]. It goes on to the [[solid geometry]] of [[three dimensions]]. Much of the ''Elements'' states results of what are now called [[algebra]] and [[number theory]], explained in geometrical language.<ref name = eves1_19/>\n\nFor more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [[parallel postulate]]) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other [[self-consistent]] [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and [[Three-dimensional space|Euclidean space]] is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  [[gravity|gravitational field]]).<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;47</ref>\n\nEuclidean geometry is an example of [[synthetic geometry]], in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of [[coordinate system|coordinates]] to specify those objects. This is in contrast to [[analytic geometry]], which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.\n\n==The ''Elements''==\n{{main|Euclid's Elements}}\nThe ''Elements'' is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\n\nThere are 13 books in the ''Elements'':\n\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example ''\"In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\"'' (Book 1 proposition 17 ) and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] ''\"In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\"'' (Book I, proposition 47)\n\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with [[number theory]], with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions. Notions such as [[prime numbers]] and [[rational number|rational]] and [[irrational number]]s are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern [[solid geometry]]. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [[platonic solid]]s are constructed.\n\n===Axioms===\n[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.]]\n\nEuclidean geometry is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] (\"true statements\") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.<ref name=Wolfe>The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in \n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1-4067-1852-1 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}\n</ref> \n\nNear the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five [[postulate]]s (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):<ref>tr. Heath, pp. 195\u2013202.</ref>\n\n:Let the following be postulated:\n# To draw a [[straight line]] from any [[Point (geometry)|point]] to any point.\n# To produce [extend] a [[Line segment|finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line.\"\n# To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance [radius].\"\n# \"That all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.\"\n# [The [[parallel postulate]]]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.\n\nAlthough Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.\n\nThe ''Elements'' also include the following five \"common notions\":\n\n# Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [[Transitive property]] of a [[Euclidean relation]]).\n# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).\n# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (Subtraction property of equality).\n# Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (Reflexive Property).\n# The whole is greater than the part.\n\n===Parallel postulate===\n{{main|Parallel postulate}}\nTo the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.<ref>{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16\u201323|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}</ref> Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the ''Elements'': his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\n\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, [[Playfair's axiom]] states:\n\n:In a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.\n\nThe \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists. \n\n[[File:euclid-proof.svg|thumb|A proof from Euclid's ''Elements'' that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle \u0391\u0392\u0393 is made by drawing circles \u0394 and \u0395 centered on the points \u0391 and \u0392, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.]]\n\n==Methods of proof==\nEuclidean Geometry is ''[[Constructive proof|constructive]]''. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a [[compass and straightedge|compass and an unmarked straightedge]].<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;56</ref> In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as [[set theory]], which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.<ref name=set_theory>Within Euclid's assumptions, it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares. However, in a more general context like set theory, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces, for example. See [[Lebesgue measure]] and [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]].</ref> Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are ''[[Scientific modelling|models]]'' of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider [[Existence theorem|nonconstructive methods]] just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones\u2014e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Shanks|title=Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Society}}</ref>\n\nEuclid often used [[proof by contradiction]]. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.<ref>Coxeter, p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\n==System of measurement and arithmetic==\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: [[angle]] and [[Euclidean distance|distance]]. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the [[right angle]] as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-[[degree (angle)|degree]] angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\n\nMeasurements of [[area (geometry)|area]] and [[volume]] are derived from distances. For example, a [[rectangle]] with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, e.g., in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\n\n[[File:Congruentie.svg|thumb|An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like [[distance]] and [[angle]]s. The latter sort of properties are called [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s and studying them is the essence of geometry.]]\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and similarly for angles. The stronger term \"[[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as [[similarity (geometry)|similar]]. [[corresponding sides and corresponding angles|Corresponding angles]] in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and [[corresponding sides]] are in proportion to each other.\n\n==Notation and terminology==\n\n===Naming of points and figures===\nPoints are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.\n\n=== Complementary and supplementary angles ===\nAngles whose sum is a right angle are called [[Complementary angles|complementary]]. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\nAngles whose sum is a straight angle are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\n=== Modern versions of Euclid's notation ===\nIn modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s or [[radian]]s.\n\nModern school textbooks often define separate figures called [[line (geometry)|line]]s (infinite), [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]] (semi-infinite), and [[line segment]]s (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as \"if the line is extended to a sufficient length,\" although he occasionally referred to \"infinite lines\". A \"line\" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term \"straight line\" when necessary.\n\n== Some important or well known results ==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:pons_asinorum_dzmanto.png|The '''[[Pons Asinorum]]''' or '''Bridge of Asses theorem''' states that in an isosceles triangle, \u03b1&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b2 and \u03b3&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b4.\nFile:Sum_of_angles_of_triangle_dzmanto.png|The '''Triangle Angle Sum theorem''' states that the sum of the three angles of any triangle, in this case angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, will always equal 180 degrees.\nFile:Pythagorean.svg|The '''[[Pythagorean theorem]]''' states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').\nFile:Thales' Theorem Simple.svg|'''[[Thales' theorem]]''' states that if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pons Asinorum===\nThe [[Pons Asinorum|Bridge of Asses]] (''Pons Asinorum'') states that ''in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.''<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 5, tr. Heath, p.&nbsp;251</ref> Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the ''Elements'' of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.<ref>Ignoring the alleged difficulty of Book I, Proposition 5, [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]] mentions another interpretation. This rests on the resemblance of the figure's lower straight lines to a steeply inclined bridge that could be crossed by an ass but not by a horse: \"But there is another view (as I have learnt lately) which is more complimentary to the ass. It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part.\" (in \"Excursis II,\" volume 1 of Heath's translation of ''The Thirteen Books of the Elements''.)</ref>\n\n===Congruence of triangles===\n[[File:Congruent triangles.svg|thumb|right|Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS).

Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.\n\n===Triangle angle sum===\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 32</ref> This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one [[obtuse angle|obtuse]] or [[right angle]].\n\n===Pythagorean theorem===\nThe celebrated [[Pythagorean theorem]] (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).\n\n===Thales' theorem===\n[[Thales' theorem]], named after [[Thales of Miletus]] states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle.

Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle<ref>Euclid, book XII, proposition 2</ref> and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.<ref>Euclid, book XI, proposition 33</ref> Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor [[Archimedes]] who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;66</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\nBecause of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:us land survey officer.jpg|A surveyor uses a [[Dumpy level|level]]\nFile:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|[[Sphere packing]] applies to a stack of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s.\nFile:Parabola with focus and arbitrary line.svg|A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.\n</gallery>\n\nAs suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was [[surveying]],<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;5</ref> and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally.<ref>Eves, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;5; Mlodinow, p.&nbsp;7</ref> The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor.

A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen learned some fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem.

Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system<ref>e.g., Tarski (1951)</ref> typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in [[elliptic geometry]]), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a [[torus]] for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\n\n==Later work==\n\n===Archimedes and Apollonius===\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]\n[[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BCE \u2013 c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.<ref>Eves, p.&nbsp;27</ref> He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the [[Archimedean property]] of finite numbers.\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BCE \u2013 c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|left|Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Portrait after [[Frans Hals]], 1648.]]\n\n===17th century: Descartes===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) developed [[analytic geometry]], an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.<ref>Ball, pp. 268ff</ref>\n\nIn this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (''x'', ''y'') coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.\n\nIn Euclid's original approach, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.\n\nThe equation\n:<math>|PQ|=\\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2} \\, </math>\ndefining the distance between two points ''P'' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'') and ''Q'' = (''q<sub>x</sub>'', ''q<sub>y</sub>'') is then known as the ''Euclidean [[metric space|metric]]'', and other metrics define [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]].\n\nIn terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., ''y'' = 2''x'' + 1 (a line), or ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 7 (a circle).\n\nAlso in the 17th century, [[Girard Desargues]], motivated by the theory of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, [[projective geometry]], but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.<ref>Eves (1963)</ref>\n\n[[File:Squaring the circle.svg|right|thumb|Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized [[compass and straightedge]].]]\n\n===18th century===\nGeometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.<ref>Hofstadter 1979, p.&nbsp;91.</ref>\n\nLeading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of [[trisecting an angle]] with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until [[Pierre Wantzel]] published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle]]. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,<ref>Theorem 120, Elements of Abstract Algebra, Allan Clark, Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-64725-0}}</ref> while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called [[affine geometry]], which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\n\n===19th century and non-Euclidean geometry===\nIn the early 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]] systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.<ref>Eves (1963), p.&nbsp;64</ref>\n\nThe century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published work on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], in which the parallel postulate is not valid.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;485</ref> Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the ''Elements''. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the ''Elements,'' shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]] property of the real numbers. Starting with [[Moritz Pasch]] in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]],<ref>* [[Howard Eves]], 1997 (1958).

In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar [[eclipse]]. The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.]]\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry.<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;191</ref> For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system.<ref>Rizos, Chris. [[University of New South Wales]]. [http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap3/312.htm GPS Satellite Signals]. 1999.</ref> It is possible to object to this interpretation of general relativity on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.\n\n==Treatment of infinity==\n\n===Infinite objects===\nEuclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between \"finite lines\" (e.g., Postulate 2) and \"[[infinity|infinite]] lines\" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.<ref name=\"Heath, p.&nbsp;200\"/>\n\nThe notion of [[infinitesimals|infinitesimal quantities]] had previously been discussed extensively by the [[Eleatic School]], but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as [[Zeno's paradox]] occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the [[method of exhaustion]] rather than infinitesimals.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nLater ancient commentators, such as [[Proclus]] (410\u2013485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.<ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;268</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, [[Otto Stolz]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], and others produced controversial work on [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\u2013[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] sense.<ref>Giuseppe Veronese, On Non-Archimedean Geometry, 1908. English translation in Real Numbers, Generalizations of the Reals, and Theories of Continua, ed. [[Philip Ehrlich]], Kluwer, 1994.</ref> Fifty years later, [[Abraham Robinson]] provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work.<ref>Robinson, Abraham (1966). Non-standard analysis.</ref>\n\n===Infinite processes===\nOne reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.<ref>For the assertion that this was the historical reason for the ancients considering the parallel postulate less obvious than the others, see Nagel and Newman 1958, p.&nbsp;9.</ref>\n\nThe modern formulation of [[proof by induction]] was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.<ref>Cajori (1918), p.&nbsp;197</ref>\n\nSupposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as [[Zeno's paradox]], predated Euclid. Euclid avoided such discussions, giving, for example, the expression for the partial sums of the [[geometric series]] in IX.35 without commenting on the possibility of letting the number of terms become infinite.\n\n==Logical basis==\n{{expert needed|mathematics|date=December 2010}}\n{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}\n{{See also|Hilbert's axioms|Axiomatic system|Real closed field}}\n\n===Classical logic===\nEuclid frequently used the method of [[proof by contradiction]], and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes [[classical logic]], in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition \"P or not P\" is automatically true.\n\n===Modern standards of rigor===\nPlacing Euclidean geometry on a solid axiomatic basis was a preoccupation of mathematicians for centuries.<ref name=Smith>A detailed discussion can be found in {{cite book |title=Methods of geometry |author= James T.

Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.\n\n[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Composition and conventions===\n\nIn his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.<ref>''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996</ref>\n\nIn ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:\n<blockquote>Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)<ref name=\"Harmon and Harmon\"/></blockquote>\n\nAn attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:<ref name=\"Harmon and Harmon\">Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.</ref>\n# Begins [[in medias res]].\n# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.\n# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).\n# Begins with a statement of the theme.\n# Includes the use of [[epithets]].\n# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].\n# Features long and formal speeches.\n# Shows divine intervention on human affairs.\n# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.\n# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].\n\nThe hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates [[Characteristics of Epic Heroes|traits]], performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native culture.\n\nConventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed \"to justify the ways of God to men\"); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]].

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)\n# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens \"in the middle of things\", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.\n# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.\n# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s \"rosy-fingered dawn\" and \"wine-dark sea\".\n\n== Form ==\nMany verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set.

The corresponding [[rocks]] are referred to as lower, middle, and upper Eocene. The [[Ypresian]] stage constitutes the lower, the [[Priabonian]] stage the upper; and the [[Lutetian]] and [[Bartonian]] stages are united as the middle Eocene.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe Eocene Epoch contained a wide variety of different climate conditions that includes the warmest climate in the [[Cenozoic Era]] and ends in an icehouse climate. The evolution of the Eocene climate began with warming after the end of the [[Palaeocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM) at 56 million years ago to a maximum during the Eocene Optimum at around 49 million years ago. During this period of time, little to no ice was present on Earth with a smaller difference in temperature from the equator to the poles. Following the maximum was a descent into an icehouse climate from the Eocene Optimum to the Eocene-Oligocene transition at 34 million years ago. During this decrease ice began to reappear at the poles, and the Eocene-Oligocene transition is the period of time where the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] began to rapidly expand.\n\n=== Atmospheric greenhouse gas evolution ===\nGreenhouse gases, in particular [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]], played a significant role during the Eocene in controlling the surface temperature. The end of the PETM was met with a very large sequestration of carbon dioxide in the form of [[methane clathrate]], [[coal]], and [[crude oil]] at the bottom of the [[Arctic Ocean]], that reduced the atmospheric carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Bowen3\" /> This event was similar in magnitude to the massive release of greenhouse gasses at the beginning of the PETM, and it is hypothesized that the sequestration was mainly due to organic carbon burial and [[weathering]] of silicates. For the early Eocene there is much discussion on how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere. This is due to numerous proxies representing different atmospheric carbon dioxide content. For example, diverse geochemical and paleontological proxies indicate that at the maximum of global warmth the atmospheric carbon dioxide values were at 700\u2013900 ppm<ref name=\"Pearson4\" /> while other proxies such as pedogenic (soil building) carbonate and marine boron isotopes indicate large changes of carbon dioxide of over 2,000 ppm over periods of time of less than 1 million years.<ref name=\"Royer5\" /> Sources for this large influx of carbon dioxide could be attributed to volcanic out-gassing due to North Atlantic rifting or oxidation of methane stored in large reservoirs deposited from the PETM event in the sea floor or wetland environments.<ref name=\"Pearson4\" /> For contrast, today the [[Atmosphere of Earth|carbon dioxide levels]] are at 400 ppm or 0.04%.\n\nAt about the beginning of the Eocene Epoch (55.8\u201333.9 million years ago) the amount of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere more or less doubled.<ref name=\"anthro.palomar.edu\">http://anthro.palomar.edu/earlyprimates/early_2.htm</ref>\n\nDuring the early Eocene, methane was another greenhouse gas that had a drastic effect on the climate. In comparison to carbon dioxide, methane has much greater effect on temperature as methane is around 34 times more effective per molecule than carbon dioxide on a 100-year scale (it has a higher [[global warming potential]]).<ref>Myhre, G., D.

Due to the warmer climate and sea level rise associated with the early Eocene, more wetlands, more forests, and more coal deposits would be available for methane release. Comparing the early Eocene production of methane to current levels of atmospheric methane, the early Eocene would be able to produce triple the amount of current methane production. The warm temperatures during the early Eocene could have increased methane production rates, and methane that is released into the atmosphere would in turn warm the troposphere, cool the stratosphere, and produce water vapor and carbon dioxide through oxidation. Biogenic production of methane produces carbon dioxide and water vapor along with the methane, as well as yielding infrared radiation. The breakdown of methane in an oxygen atmosphere produces carbon monoxide, water vapor and infrared radiation. The carbon monoxide is not stable so it eventually becomes carbon dioxide and in doing so releases yet more infrared radiation. Water vapor traps more infrared than does carbon dioxide.\n\nThe middle to late Eocene marks not only the switch from warming to cooling, but also the change in carbon dioxide from increasing to decreasing. At the end of the Eocene Optimum, carbon dioxide began decreasing due to increased siliceous plankton productivity and marine carbon burial.<ref name=\"Pearson4\" /> At the beginning of the middle Eocene an event that may have triggered or helped with the draw down of carbon dioxide was the [[Azolla event]] at around 49 million years ago.<ref name=\"Speelman7\" /> With the equable climate during the early Eocene, warm temperatures in the arctic allowed for the growth of [[azolla]], which is a floating aquatic fern, on the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Compared to current carbon dioxide levels, these azolla grew rapidly in the enhanced carbon dioxide levels found in the early Eocene. As these [[azolla]] sank into the Arctic Ocean, they became buried and sequestered their carbon into the seabed. This event could have led to a draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide of up to 470 ppm.<ref name=\"Speelman7\" /> Assuming the carbon dioxide concentrations were at 900 ppmv prior to the [[Azolla Event]] they would have dropped to 430 ppmv, or 30 ppmv more than they are today, after the Azolla Event. Another event during the middle Eocene that was a sudden and temporary reversal of the cooling conditions was the [[Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum]].<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" /> At around 41.5 million years ago, stable isotopic analysis of samples from Southern Ocean drilling sites indicated a warming event for 600 thousand years. A sharp increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was observed with a maximum of 4000 ppm: the highest amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide detected during the Eocene.<ref name=\"Pearson9\" /> The main hypothesis for such a radical transition was due to the continental drift and collision of the India continent with the Asia continent and the resulting formation of the [[Himalayas]]. Another hypothesis involves extensive sea floor rifting and metamorphic decarbonation reactions releasing considerable amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" />\n\nAt the end of the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, cooling and the carbon dioxide drawdown continued through the late Eocene and into the Eocene-Oligocene transition around 34 million years ago. Multiple proxies, such as oxygen isotopes and [[alkenone]]s, indicate that at the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration had decreased to around 750\u2013800 ppm, approximately twice that of [[Atmosphere of Earth|present levels]].<ref name=\"Pagani10\" /><ref name=\"Lear11\" />\n\n=== Early Eocene and the equable climate problem ===\nOne of the unique features of the Eocene's climate as mentioned before was the equable and homogeneous climate that existed in the early parts of the Eocene. A multitude of [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]] support the presence of a warmer equable climate being present during this period of time. A few of these proxies include the presence of fossils native to warm climates, such as [[crocodile]]s, located in the higher latitudes,<ref name=\"Sloan12\" /><ref name=\"Huber13\" /> the presence in the high latitudes of frost-intolerant flora such as [[palm trees]] which cannot survive during sustained freezes,<ref name=\"Huber13\" /><ref name=\"Huber14\" /> and fossils of [[snakes]] found in the tropics that would require much higher average temperatures to sustain them.<ref name=\"Huber13\" /> Using isotope proxies to determine ocean temperatures indicates sea surface temperatures in the tropics as high as {{Convert|35|C}} and, relative to present-day values, bottom water temperatures that are 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) higher.<ref name=\"Huber14\" /> With these bottom water temperatures, temperatures in areas where deep-water forms near the poles are unable to be much cooler than the bottom water temperatures.\n\nAn issue arises, however, when trying to model the Eocene and reproduce the results that are found with the [[Proxy (climate)|proxy data]].<ref name=\"Sloan15\" /> Using all different ranges of greenhouse gasses that occurred during the early Eocene, models were unable to produce the warming that was found at the poles and the reduced seasonality that occurs with winters at the poles being substantially warmer. The models, while accurately predicting the tropics, tend to produce significantly cooler temperatures of up to 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) colder than the actual determined temperature at the poles.<ref name=\"Huber14\" /> This error has been classified as the \u201cequable climate problem\u201d. To solve this problem, the solution would involve finding a process to warm the poles without warming the tropics. Some hypotheses and tests which attempt to find the process are listed below.\n\n==== Large lakes ====\nDue to the nature of water as opposed to land, less temperature variability would be present if a large body of water is also present. In an attempt to try to mitigate the cooling polar temperatures, large lakes were proposed to mitigate seasonal climate changes.<ref name=\"Sloan16\" /> To replicate this case, a lake was inserted into North America and a climate model was run using varying carbon dioxide levels. The model runs concluded that while the lake did reduce the seasonality of the region greater than just an increase in carbon dioxide, the addition of a large lake was unable to reduce the seasonality to the levels shown by the floral and faunal data.\n\n==== Ocean heat transport ====\nThe transport of heat from the tropics to the poles, much like how ocean heat transport functions in modern times, was considered a possibility for the increased temperature and reduced seasonality for the poles.<ref name=\"Huber17\" /> With the increased sea surface temperatures and the increased temperature of the deep ocean water during the early Eocene, one common hypothesis was that due to these increases there would be a greater transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Simulating these differences, the models produced lower heat transport due to the lower temperature gradients and were unsuccessful in producing an equable climate from only ocean heat transport.\n\n==== Orbital parameters ====\nWhile typically seen as a control on ice growth and seasonality, the orbital parameters were theorized as a possible control on continental temperatures and seasonality.<ref name=\"Sloan18\" /> Simulating the Eocene by using an ice free planet, [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[obliquity]], and [[precession]] were modified in different model runs to determine all the possible different scenarios that could occur and their effects on temperature. One particular case led to warmer winters and cooler summer by up to 30% in the North American continent, and it reduced the seasonal variation of temperature by up to 75%. While orbital parameters did not produce the warming at the poles, the parameters did show a great effect on seasonality and needed to be considered.\n\n==== Polar stratospheric clouds ====\nAnother method considered for producing the warm polar temperatures were [[polar stratospheric clouds]].<ref name=\"Sloan19\" /> Polar stratospheric clouds are clouds that occur in the lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. Polar stratospheric clouds have a great impact on radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their optical thickness, polar stratospheric clouds act similar to a greenhouse gas and traps outgoing longwave radiation. Different types of polar stratospheric clouds occur in the atmosphere: polar stratospheric clouds that are created due to interactions with nitric or sulfuric acid and water (Type I) or polar stratospheric clouds that are created with only water ice (Type II).\n\nMethane is an important factor in the creation of the primary Type II polar stratospheric clouds that were created in the early Eocene.<ref name=\"Sloan20\" /> Since water vapor is the only supporting substance used in Type II polar stratospheric clouds, the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is necessary where in most situations the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is rare. When methane is oxidized, a significant amount of water vapor is released. Another requirement for polar stratospheric clouds is cold temperatures to ensure condensation and cloud production. Polar stratospheric cloud production, since it requires the cold temperatures, is usually limited to nighttime and winter conditions. With this combination of wetter and colder conditions in the lower stratosphere, polar stratospheric clouds could have formed over wide areas in Polar Regions.\n\nTo test the polar stratospheric clouds effects on the Eocene climate, models were run comparing the effects of polar stratospheric clouds at the poles to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Sloan19\" /> The polar stratospheric clouds had a warming effect on the poles, increasing temperatures by up to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C in the winter months. A multitude of feedbacks also occurred in the models due to the polar stratospheric clouds' presence. Any ice growth was slowed immensely and would lead to any present ice melting. Only the poles were affected with the change in temperature and the tropics were unaffected, which with an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would also cause the tropics to increase in temperature. Due to the warming of the troposphere from the increased greenhouse effect of the polar stratospheric clouds, the stratosphere would cool and would potentially increase the amount of polar stratospheric clouds.\n\nWhile the polar stratospheric clouds could explain the reduction of the equator to pole temperature gradient and the increased temperatures at the poles during the early Eocene, there are a few drawbacks to maintaining polar stratospheric clouds for an extended period of time. Separate model runs were used to determine the sustainability of the polar stratospheric clouds.<ref name=\"Kirk21\" /> Methane would need to be continually released and sustained to maintain the lower stratospheric water vapor. Increasing amounts of ice and condensation nuclei would be need to be high for the polar stratospheric cloud to sustain itself and eventually expand.\n\n=== Hyperthermals through the Early Eocene ===\nDuring the warming in the Early Eocene between 52 and 55 million years ago, there were a series of short-term changes of [[carbon isotope]] composition in the ocean.<ref name=\"Galeotti22\" /> These isotope changes occurred due to the release of carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere that led to a temperature increase of 4-8\u00b0C (7-14\u00b0F) at the surface of the ocean. These hyperthermals led to increased perturbations in planktonic and benthic [[foraminifera]], with a higher rate of sedimentation as a consequence of the warmer temperatures. Recent analysis of and research into these hyperthermals in the early Eocene has led to hypotheses that the hyperthermals are based on orbital parameters, in particular eccentricity and obliquity. The hyperthermals in the early Eocene, notably the [[Palaeocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), the [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2]] (ETM2), and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 3 (ETM3), were analyzed and found that orbital control may have had a role in triggering the ETM2 and ETM3.\n\n=== Greenhouse to icehouse climate ===\nThe Eocene is not only known for containing the warmest period during the Cenozoic, but it also marked the decline into an icehouse climate and the rapid expansion of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The transition from a warming climate into a cooling climate began at ~49 million years ago. Isotopes of carbon and oxygen indicate a shift to a global cooling climate.<ref name=\"Speelman7\" /> The cause of the cooling has been attributed to a significant decrease of >2000&nbsp;ppm in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.<ref name=\"Pearson4\" /> One proposed cause of the reduction in carbon dioxide during the warming to cooling transition was the [[azolla event]]. The increased warmth at the poles, the isolated Arctic basin during the early Eocene, and the significantly high amounts of carbon dioxide possibly led to [[azolla]] blooms across the Arctic Ocean.<ref name=\"Speelman7\" /> The isolation of the Arctic Ocean led to stagnant waters and as the azolla sank to the sea floor, they became part of the sediments and effectively sequestered the carbon. The ability for the azolla to sequester carbon is exceptional, and the enhanced burial of azolla could have had a significant effect on the world atmospheric carbon content and may have been the event to begin the transition into an ice house climate. Cooling after this event continued due to continual decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide from organic productivity and [[weathering]] from [[mountain building]].<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" />\n\nGlobal cooling continued until there was a major reversal from cooling to warming indicated in the [[Southern Ocean]] at around 42\u201341 million years ago.<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" /> [[Oxygen isotope]] analysis showed a large negative change in the proportion of heavier oxygen isotopes to lighter oxygen isotopes, which indicates an increase in global temperatures. This warming event is known as the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. The cause of the warming is considered to be primarily due to carbon dioxide increases, because carbon isotope signatures rule out major methane release during this short term warming.<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" /> The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is considered to be due to increased [[seafloor spreading]] rates between Australia and Antarctica and increased amounts of [[volcanism]] in the region. Another possible atmospheric carbon dioxide increase could be during a sudden increase with metamorphic release during the [[Himalayan orogeny]], however data on the exact timing of metamorphic release of atmospheric carbon dioxide is not well resolved in the data.<ref name=\"Bohaty8\" /> Recent studies have mentioned, however, that the removal of the ocean between Asia and India could release significant amounts of carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Pearson9\" /> This warming is short lived, as benthic oxygen isotope records indicate a return to cooling at ~40 million years ago.<ref name=\"Pagani10\" />\n\nCooling continued throughout the rest of the late Eocene into the Eocene-Oligocene transition. During the cooling period, benthic oxygen isotopes show the possibility of ice creation and ice increase during this later cooling.<ref name=\"Pearson4\" /> The end of the Eocene and beginning of the Oligocene is marked with the massive expansion of area of the Antarctic ice sheet that was a major step into the icehouse climate.<ref name=\"Lear11\" /> Along with the decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide reducing the global temperature, orbital factors in ice creation can be seen with 100,000-year and 400,000-year fluctuations in benthic oxygen isotope records.<ref name=\"Diester23\" /> Another major contribution to the expansion of the ice sheet was the creation of the [[Antarctic circumpolar current]].<ref name=\"Barker24\" /> The creation of the Antarctic circumpolar current would isolate the cold water around the Antarctic, which would reduce heat transport to the Antarctic<ref name=\"Huber25\" /> along with creating [[ocean gyre]]s that result in the [[upwelling]] of colder bottom waters.<ref name=\"Barker24\" /> The issue with this hypothesis of the consideration of this being a factor for the Eocene-Oligocene transition is the timing of the creation of the circulation is uncertain.<ref name=\"Barker26\" /> For [[Drake Passage]], sediments indicate the opening occurred ~41 million years ago while tectonics indicate that this occurred ~32 million years ago.\n\n== Palaeogeography ==\nDuring the Eocene, the [[continent]]s continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] toward their present positions.\n\nAt the beginning of the period, [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the [[heat]] around the [[planet]] and keeping global temperatures high, but when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were routed away from Antarctica. An isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and [[icefloe]]s north, reinforcing the cooling.\n\nThe northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to fragment, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart.\n\nIn western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts, resulting in the deposition of the [[Green River Formation]] [[lagerst\u00e4tte]].\n\nAt about 35 Ma, an asteroid impact on the eastern coast of North America formed the [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]].\n\nIn Europe, the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] finally disappeared, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar.\n\n[[India]] began its collision with [[Asia]], [[fold (geology)|fold]]ing to initiate formation of the [[Himalaya]]s.\n\nIt is hypothesized{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that the Eocene hothouse world was caused by runaway global warming from released [[methane clathrate]]s deep in the [[ocean]]s. The [[clathrate]]s were buried beneath [[mud]] that was disturbed as the oceans warmed. [[Methane]] ([[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>4</sub>) has ten to twenty times the [[greenhouse gas]] effect of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>).\n\n==Flora==\nAt the beginning of the Eocene, the high [[temperature]]s and warm oceans created a moist, balmy environment, with [[forest]]s spreading throughout the Earth from pole to pole. Apart from the driest [[desert]]s, Earth must have been entirely covered in forests.\n\nPolar forests were quite extensive. [[Fossil]]s and even preserved remains of trees such as [[Cupressaceae|swamp cypress]] and [[dawn redwood]] from the Eocene have been found on [[Ellesmere Island]] in the [[Arctic]]. <!-- The preserved remains are not fossils, but actual pieces preserved in oxygen-poor [[water]] in the [[swamp]]y forests of the time and then buried before they had the chance to [[decompose]]. --> Even at that time, Ellesmere Island was only a few degrees in latitude further south than it is today. Fossils of [[subtropical]] and even tropical trees and plants from the Eocene also have been found in Greenland and [[Alaska]]. [[Tropical rainforest]]s grew as far north as northern [[North America]] and [[Europe]].\n\n[[Palm tree]]s were growing as far north as Alaska and [[northern Europe]] during the early Eocene, although they became less abundant as the climate cooled. [[Dawn redwood]]s were far more extensive as well.\n\nThe earliest definitive [[Eucalyptus]] fossils were dated from 51.9 Mya, and were found in the Laguna del Hunco deposit in [[Chubut province]] in [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gandolfo | first1 = MA | last2 = Hermsen | first2 = EJ | last3 = Zamaloa | first3 = MC | last4 = Nixon | first4 = KC | last5 = Gonz\u00e1lez | first5 = CC | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = Oldest Known Eucalyptus Macrofossils Are from South America | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 6| page = e21084 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0021084 |bibcode = 2011PLoSO...621084G | pmid=21738605 | pmc=3125177}}</ref> \n\nCooling began mid-period, and by the end of the Eocene continental interiors had begun to dry out, with forests thinning out considerably in some areas. The newly evolved [[grasses]] were still confined to [[river]] banks and [[lake]] shores, and had not yet expanded into [[plain]]s and [[savanna]]s.\n\nThe cooling also brought [[season]]al changes. [[Deciduous]] trees, better able to cope with large temperature changes, began to overtake [[evergreen]] tropical species. By the end of the period, deciduous forests covered large parts of the northern continents, including North America, [[Eurasia]] and the Arctic, and rainforests held on only in equatorial [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[Australia]].\n\n[[Antarctica]], which began the Eocene fringed with a warm temperate to sub-tropical [[rainforest]], became much colder as the period progressed; the heat-loving tropical [[flora (plants)|flora]] was wiped out, and by the beginning of the Oligocene, the continent hosted deciduous forests and vast stretches of [[tundra]].\n\n== Fauna ==\n[[Image:Crassostrea gigantissima (Finch, 1824).JPG|thumb|''Crassostrea gigantissima'' (Finch, 1824), a giant oyster from the Eocene of [[Texas]]]]\n[[Image:Nummulitids.jpg|thumb|right|Fossil nummulitid [[foraminifera]]ns showing microspheric and megalospheric individuals; Eocene of the [[United Arab Emirates]]; scale in mm.]]\nThe oldest known [[fossil]]s of most of the modern mammal orders appear within a brief period during the early Eocene. At the beginning of the Eocene, several new mammal groups arrived in North America. These modern mammals, like [[artiodactyl]]s, [[perissodactyls]] and [[primate]]s, had features like long, thin [[leg]]s, feet and [[hand]]s capable of grasping, as well as differentiated [[teeth]] adapted for chewing. [[Insular dwarfism|Dwarf]] forms reigned. All the members of the new mammal orders were small, under 10&nbsp;kg; based on comparisons of tooth size, Eocene mammals were only 60% of the size of the primitive Palaeocene mammals that preceded them. They were also smaller than the mammals that followed them. It is assumed that the hot Eocene temperatures favored smaller animals that were better able to manage the heat.\n\nBoth groups of modern [[ungulate]]s (hoofed animals) became prevalent because of a major radiation between Europe and North America, along with carnivorous ungulates like ''[[Mesonyx]]''. Early forms of many other modern mammalian orders appeared, including [[bat]]s, [[proboscidea|proboscidians]] (elephants), primates, [[rodent]]s and [[marsupials]]. Older primitive forms of mammals declined in variety and importance. Important Eocene land fauna fossil remains have been found in western North America, Europe, [[Patagonia]], [[Egypt]] and [[southeast Asia]]. Marine fauna are best known from [[South Asia]] and the [[southeast United States]].\n\nReptile fossils from this time, such as fossils of [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[turtle]]s, are abundant. The remains of ''[[Titanoboa]]'', a snake the length of a school bus, was discovered in South America along with other large reptilian megafauna.<ref name=\"Head, Jj; Bloch, Ji; Hastings, Ak; Bourque, Jr; Cadena, Ea; Herrera, Fa; Polly, Pd; Jaramillo, Ca 2009 715\u20137\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature07671 |date=February 2009 |author1=Head, Jj |author2=Bloch, Ji |author3=Hastings, Ak |author4=Bourque, Jr |author5=Cadena, Ea |author6=Herrera, Fa|authorlink7=P.

Many modern [[Aves|bird]] orders first appeared in the Eocene.\n\nSeveral rich fossil insect faunas are known from the Eocene, notably the [[Baltic amber]] found mainly along the south coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], amber from the [[Paris Basin]], France, the [[Fur Formation]], [[Denmark]] and the [[Bembridge Marls]] from the [[Isle of Wight]], England. Insects found in Eocene deposits are mostly assignable to modern genera, though frequently these genera do not occur in the area at present. For instance the [[Bibionidae|bibionid]] genus ''[[Plecia]]'' is common in fossil faunas from presently temperate areas, but only lives in the tropics and subtropics today.\n\n=== Oceans ===\n[[Image:Basilosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Basilosaurus'']]\n[[Image:Prorastomus BW.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[Prorastomus]]'', an early [[sirenia]]n]]\nThe Eocene oceans were warm and teeming with [[fish]] and other sea life. The first [[Carcharhiniformes|carcharinid sharks]] evolved, as did early marine mammals, including ''[[Basilosaurus]]'', an early species of [[whale]] that is thought to be descended from land animals that existed earlier in the Eocene.

The agglomeration has a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population urbanmetro|Eindhoven Urban}}}}. The metropolitan area consists of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population urbanmetro|Eindhoven Metro}}}} inhabitants. The [[city region]] has a population of 753,426. The [[Brabantse Stedenrij]] combined [[metropolitan area]] has about 2 million inhabitants.\n\n== Name ==\nThe name derives from the contraction of the regional words ''eind'' (meaning \"last\" or \"end\") and ''hove'' (or ''hoeve'', a section of some 14 [[hectares]] of land). [[toponomy|Toponymically]],  ''eind'' occurs commonly as a prefix and postfix in local place- and streetnames. A \"hove\" comprised a parcel of land which a local lord might [[leasehold|lease]] to private persons (such as farmers). Given that a string of such parcels existed around [[Woensel]], the name ''Eindhoven'' may have originated with the meaning \"last hoves on the land of Woensel\".\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Eindhoven}}\n\n=== 13th\u201315th centuries ===\nThe [[Recorded history|written history]] of Eindhoven started in 1232, when Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Hendrik I of Brabant]] granted [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] to ''Eindhoven'', then a small town right on the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. At the time of granting of its [[Royal charter|charter]], Eindhoven had approximately 170 houses enclosed by a [[Defensive wall|rampart]]. Just outside the city walls stood a small castle. The city was also granted the right to organize a weekly market and the farmers in nearby villages were obliged to come to Eindhoven to sell their produce. Another factor in its establishment was its location on the [[trade route]] from Holland to [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nAround 1388, the city's fortifications were strengthened further. And between 1413 and 1420, a new castle was built within the city walls. In 1486, Eindhoven was plundered and burned by troops from [[Guelders]].\n\n=== 16th\u201318th centuries ===\nThe reconstruction of Eindhoven was finished in 1502, with a stronger rampart and a new castle. However, in 1543 it fell again, its defense works having been neglected due to poverty.\n\nA big fire in 1554 destroyed 75% of the houses but by 1560 these had been rebuilt with the help of [[William the Silent|William I of Orange]]. During the [[Dutch Revolt]], Eindhoven changed hands between the Dutch and the [[Spain|Spanish]] several times during which it was burned down by renegade Spanish soldiers, until [[Siege of Eindhoven (1583)|finally in 1583 it was captured once more by Spanish troops]] and its city walls were demolished.\n\nEindhoven did not become part of the Netherlands until 1629. During the French occupation, Eindhoven suffered again with many of its houses destroyed by the invading forces. Eindhoven remained a minor city after that until the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] of the 19th century provided a major growth impulse. Canals, roads and railroads were constructed. Eindhoven was connected to the major [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] canal through the [[Eindhovens Kanaal]] branch in 1843 and was connected by rail to [[Tilburg]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Venlo]] and [[Belgium]] between 1866 and 1870. Industrial activities initially centred around [[tobacco]] and [[textile]] and boomed with the rise of [[lighting]] and [[electronics]] giant [[Philips]], which was founded as a [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] manufacturing company in Eindhoven in 1891.\n\nIndustrialization brought population growth to Eindhoven. At the establishment of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815, Eindhoven had 2,310 inhabitants.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nBy 1920, the population was 47,946; by 1925 it was 63,870 and in 1935 that had ballooned to 103,030.<ref name=\"GrowthOfEndhoven\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/historie-1/Groei-van-Eindhoven-1.htm |title=Eindhoven - Groei van Eindhoven (inwoners) |website=Eindhoven.nl |date=2016-04-30 |accessdate=2017-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306133502/https://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/historie-1/Groei-van-Eindhoven-1.htm |archive-date=6 March 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The explosive growth of industry in the region and the subsequent housing needs of workers called for radical changes in administration, as the City of Eindhoven was still confined to its [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[moat]] city limits. In 1920, the five neighbouring [[municipality|municipalities]] of [[Woensel]] (to the north), [[Tongelre]] (northeast and east), [[Stratum, Netherlands|Stratum]] (southeast), [[Gestel en Blaarthem]] (southwest) and [[Strijp]] (west), which already bore the brunt of the housing needs and related problems, were incorporated into the new Groot-Eindhoven (\"Greater Eindhoven\") municipality. The prefix \"Groot-\" was later dropped.\n\nAfter the incorporation of 1920, the five former municipalities became districts of the Municipality of Eindhoven, with Eindhoven-Centrum (the City proper) forming the sixth. Since then, an additional seventh district has been formed by dividing the largest district, that of Woensel, into Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord.\n\nThe early 20th century saw additions in technical industry with the advent of [[Automobile|car]] and [[truck]] manufacturing company [[DAF Trucks|Van Doorne's Automobiel Fabriek]] (DAF) and the subsequent shift towards electronics and engineering, with the traditional tobacco and textile industries waning and finally disappearing in the 1970s.\n\n[[File:People of Eindhoven line the streets.jpg|thumb|left|People of Eindhoven (during [[World War II]]) watching [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] entering the city following its liberation from [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] on 19 September 1944.]]\n[[File:Eindhoven, straatzicht 18 Septemberplein-Vestdijk-Stationsplein foto3 2014-05-04 10.35.jpg|Eindhoven, view to a street: 18 Septemberplein-Vestdijk-Stationsplein|thumb|right]]\nA first [[airstrike|air raid]] in [[World War II]] was flown by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 6 December 1942 targeting the [[Philips]] factory downtown. 148 civilians died, even though the attack was carried out on a Sunday by low-flying [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] bombers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec42.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec42.html |archivedate=6 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/6th-december-1942-low-level-daylight-attack-on-the-philips-plant-holland|title=Low level daylight attack on the Philips plant, Holland - WWII Today|date=6 December 2012|publisher=}}</ref> Large-scale air raids, including the bombing by the Luftwaffe on 18 September during [[Operation Market Garden]], destroyed large parts of the city. The reconstruction that followed left very little historical remains and the postwar reconstruction period saw drastic renovation plans in [[High-rise|highrise]] style, some of which were implemented. At the time, there was little regard for historical [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. During the 1960s, a new [[City and town halls|city hall]] was built and its neogothic predecessor (1867) demolished to make way for a planned [[arterial road]] that never materialised.\n\nThe 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s saw large-scale [[housing developments]] in the districts of Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord, making Eindhoven the fifth-largest city in the Netherlands. At the start of the 21st century, a whole new [[Subdivision (land)|housing development]] called [[Meerhoven]] was constructed at the site of the old [[airport]] of Welschap, west of Eindhoven. The airport itself, now called [[Eindhoven Airport]], had moved earlier to a new location, paving the way for much needed new houses. Meerhoven is part of the Strijp district and partially lies on lands annexed from the municipality of [[Veldhoven]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Subdivision of Eindhoven into districts, quarters and neighborhoods}}\n[[File:Eindhoven-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Topographic map of Eindhoven (city), September 2014]]\nThe villages and city that make up modern Eindhoven were originally built on sandy elevations between the Dommel, Gender and [[Tongelreep (river)|Tongelreep]] streams. Beginning in the 19th century, the [[sedimentary basin|basins]] of the streams themselves have also been used as housing grounds, resulting in occasional floodings in the city centre. Partly to reduce flooding, the bed of the Gender stream, which flowed directly through the city centre, was dammed off and filled up after the War, and the course of the Dommel was regulated.

Varieties of the [[Brabantian dialect]] used to be spoken in the former villages of Gestel, Woensel and Stratum, but are now almost extinct. The closest city to Eindhoven in which Brabantian is spoken is [[Helmond]].<ref name=\"daniels\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nEindhoven has grown from a little town in 1232 to one of the biggest cities in the [[Netherlands]] with around 212,000 inhabitants in 2009. Much of its growth is due to [[Philips]], [[DAF Trucks]] and [[Brabantia]].\n\nAfter the resurrection of the Netherlands in 1815 and the end of the [[Belgian Revolution]], Eindhoven was a small village of some 1250 people in an economically backward and mostly agricultural area. Cheap land, cheap labor and the existence of pre-industrial [[homesourcing]]  (''huisnijverheid'' in Dutch) made Eindhoven an attractive area for the developing industries which were being stimulated by the government of [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]]. During the 19th century, Eindhoven grew into an industrial town with factories for [[textile industry|textile weaving]], [[cigar]] manufacturing, [[match|match making]] and [[hat|hat making]]. Most of these industries disappeared again after [[World War II]], though.\n[[File:Aanzicht op de Lichttoren en gebouw ED en EC, met links de Emmasingel en rechts de Mathildelaan - Eindhoven - 20338971 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[:nl:Lichttoren (Eindhoven)|Philips Light Tower]] in 2000.]]\n\nIn 1891, brothers [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] founded the small light bulb factory that would grow into one of the largest electronics firms in the world. [[Philips]]' presence is probably the largest single contributing factor to the major growth of Eindhoven in the 20th century. It attracted and spun off many [[High tech|hi-tech]] companies, making Eindhoven a major technology and industrial hub. In 2005, a full third of the total amount of money spent on research in the Netherlands was spent in or around Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in [[technology]] and [[Information technology|ICT]], with companies such as [[FEI Company]] (once Philips Electron Optics), [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly Philips Semiconductors), [[ASML Holding|ASML]], [[ALTEN]], Simac, Neways Electronics and the aforementioned Philips and DAF.\n\nEindhoven has long been a centre of cooperation between research institutes and industry. This tradition started with Philips (the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|NatLab]] was a physical expression of this) and has since expanded to large cooperative networks. The [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] hosts an incubator for technology startups and the NatLab has developed into the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]]. Also, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has opened a branch on the university campus. This tradition has also fostered inter-industry cooperation in the region; one example of this is the announcement in September 2010 of a new research lab for high-grade packaging materials, a cooperation of [[IPS Packaging (Netherlands)|IPS Packaging]] and [[Thales Nederland|Thales Cryognetics]].<ref name=\"PackagingLab\">{{cite web |url=http://www.technischweekblad.nl/nieuw-testlab-voor-hoogwaardige-verpakkingen.108164.lynkx |title=Nieuw testlab voor hoogwaardige verpakkingen  |first=Joop |last=Wenstedt |date=25 September 2010 |work=[[Technisch Weekblad]] |publisher=Uitgeverij B\u00e8ta Publishers |location=[[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] |language=Dutch |trans-title=New testing lab for high-grade packaging materials |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis cooperative tradition has also developed into a different direction than the traditional technology research done at the university. Starting in 2002, the university, the Catharina hospital, Philips Medical and the [[University of Maastricht]] joined forces and started joint research into [[biomedical science]], [[biomedical technology|technology]] and [[biomedical engineering|engineering]]. Within Eindhoven, this research has been concentrated in a new university faculty (BioMedical Technology or BMT). This development has also made Eindhoven a biomedical technology hub within the country and its (European) region.\n[[File:Overzicht - Eindhoven - 20396788 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|The Evoluon [[Exhibition center|conference center]].]]\n\nPrime examples of industrial heritage in Eindhoven are the renovated Witte Dame (''\"White Lady\"'') complex, a former Philips lamp factory; and the Admirant building (informally known as Bruine Heer or ''\"Brown Gentleman\"'' in reference to the Witte Dame across the street), the former Philips main offices.

The Eindhoven city council consists of 45 elected representatives from the Eindhoven municipality. These are elected during municipal elections from candidates running in Eindhoven. Eindhoven politics consists of local branches of the national political parties and purely local parties with strictly local interests. The city council reflects this mix in its makeup.\n\nThe last three municipal elections were held on 7 March 2006, 3 March 2010 and 19 March 2014. The division of the 45 seats in the Eindhoven city council after these elections is shown below:<ref name=\"ElectionResultsCityCouncil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/Default.aspx |title=Databank verkiezingsuitslagen |website=Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Party!!Percentage in 2006!!Seats in 2006!!Percentage in 2010!!Seats in 2010!!Percentage in 2014!!Seats in 2014\n|-\n|[[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]||26.99%||14||20.56%||10||15.9%||8\n|-\n|[[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]||14.60%||7||11.50%||6||8.0%||4\n|-\n|[[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]||12.87%||6||8.70%||4||14.6%||7\n|-\n|[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]||11.78%||6||15.65%||8||13.5%||6\n|-\n|[[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]]||7.07%||3||8.88%||4||7.6%||4\n|-\n|[[Livable Eindhoven]]||8.88%||4||3.22%||1||4.0%||2\n|-\n|Senior Appeal Eindhoven||4.88%||2||6.23%||3||9.7%||5\n|-\n|[[Democrats 66|D66]]||3.33%||1||12.19%||6||14.7%||7\n|-\n|City Party||2.44%||1||1.40%||0||-||-\n|-\n|[[Pim Fortuyn List]]||2.27%||1||4.57%||2||3.7%||1\n|-\n|[[Christian Union (Netherlands)|ChristianUnion]]||2.22%||1||1.81%||0||2.0%||1\n|-\n|Students List Eindhoven||1.69%||0||-||-||-||-\n|-\n|Future Party (PvdT)||1.05%||0||0.8%||0||0.6%||0\n|-\n|New Right||0.98%||0||-||-||-||-\n|-\n|Liberal Eindhoven||0.90%||0||-||-||-||-\n|-\n|[[Trots op Nederland|Trots op Nederland/Lijst Rita Verdonk]]||-||-||2.84%||1||-||-\n|-\n|Eindhoven Now||-||-||1.16%||0||-||-\n|-\n|J.C.W.M.

The [[burgemeester|mayor]] is appointed by the [[monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch]], but the council of [[wethouder|aldermen]] is composed as a result of the formation of a local [[coalition government]]. This coalition is formed in such a way as to be able to rely on a majority of the votes in the city council.\n\nIn May 2014, a coalition was formed between [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]], [[Democrats 66|D66]], [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] and [[GroenLinks]]. Together they have 26 seats in the city council. The council of aldermen consists of the following people:<ref name=\"CollegeBW2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/artikelen/College-van-BW-20142018.htm |title=College van B&W 2014\u20132018 |publisher=Gemeente Eindhoven |accessdate=20 May 2014 |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803141123/http://www.eindhoven.nl/artikelen/College-van-BW-20142018.htm |archive-date=3 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n* Mary-Ann Schreurs ([[Democrats 66|D66]]): [[innovation]] and [[design]], [[sustainability]] and [[culture]]\n* Lenie Scholten ([[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]]): [[healthcare]] and WIJeindhoven\n* Staf Depla ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]): [[economy]], [[Employment|work]] and [[income]] and [[vocational education]]\n* Bianca van Kaathoven ([[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]): Active city, [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and permits\n*[[Marco van Dorst]] ([[Democrats 66|D66]]): [[Spatial planning]] and [[treasury]]\n*[[Yasin Torunoglu]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]): Living, [[borough]]s, space and citizen participation\n*[[Jannie Visscher]] ([[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]): [[Youth]], [[education]], [[traffic]] and [[transport]]\n\n==== Mayor ====\nThe [[burgemeester|mayors]] of the Netherlands are not elected but appointed by the [[Politics of the Netherlands|crown]]. Nevertheless, there has been a movement over the last few years to give the municipalities more say in who will be their mayor, which has resulted in [[referendum|consultative referenda]] being held in the larger cities to \"suggest\" a candidate for the post. This was also tried in Eindhoven and as a result the current mayor is [[Rob van Gijzel]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]).\n\nOn 23 January 2008, a referendum to elect a mayor was held in Eindhoven. This referendum, the second of its kind in the Netherlands, was attended by 24.6% of the inhabitants. This was less than the required 30% needed to make a referendum binding. Nevertheless, the city council would choose the winner of the referendum as the preferred candidate. The main reason for the low attendance was that the candidates, [[Leen Verbeek]] and Rob van Gijzel, were from the same party. Rob van Gijzel won the referendum with 61.8% of the votes and was appointed the city's new mayor.\n\nThe mayor is the chairman of the Council of B&W. He also has responsibility for a number of specific posts (like the aldermen). In the current council, mayor Van Gijzel holds responsibility for the following posts:<ref name=\"CollegeBW2014\"/>\n\n*Communication\n\nIf unavailable, the mayor is temporarily replaced by one of the aldermen.\n\n==Culture and recreation==\nCulturally and recreationally, Eindhoven was formed by two forces:\n\n*Being a university city, Eindhoven has a large student population. The students from the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and a number of undergraduate schools give Eindhoven a young population, whose recreational needs are catered to by several different festivals, clubs and such.\n*For a long time Eindhoven was the main location of Philips. The Philips company undertook a lot of effort in the \"cultural formation\" of its workforce and has given the city both cultural institutions (such as the former [[Philips Ontspannings Centrum|POC]] and the [[Muziekcentrum Frits Philips]]) and sporting institutions (notably [[Philips Sport Vereniging|PSV]]).\n\nEindhoven is also known as the City of Light, due to the Company Philips originating there and because of the several projects involving lighting up buildings of the city. During [[Carnival]], Eindhoven is rechristened ''Lampegat'' (Hamlet of Lamps, although for the ironic purposes of carnival the translation ''Hole in the ground with lamps'' is closer to the mark); this refers again to the important role of [[Philips]] in the Eindhoven community.\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThere are several cultural institutions in and around the city.\n\n====Museums====\n \n*There are two museums dedicated to the major topics of the city's industrial heritage: the [[DAF Museum]] has a collection of DAF cars and the [[Philips Gloeilampenfabriekje anno 1891]] (across the street from the Kempenland) documents the early [[lightbulb]] industry.\n*The former district court house now houses the [[Designhuis]], a public podium and interaction area for modern design and innovation.\n*The [[Eindhoven Museum]] is an [[archaeological open-air museum]] which focuses on the region's [[Iron Age]] and [[Middle Ages]]. It merged in 2011 with Museum Kempenland which was a regional museum, which documents the history of the [[Kempenland]] region in objects, documents, paint and educational activities. Museum Kempenland's old location, the Steentjeskerk, is closed. \n*The [[Inkijkmuseum]] (the ''Look-In museum''; housed in an old [[linen]] factory in the Dommelstraat) is a small but special museum: it offers ever-changing exhibits, which are to be viewed through the building's windows.\n*The [[Van Abbemuseum]] has a collection of modern and [[contemporary art]], including works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondriaan|Mondriaan]] and [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]].\n* De '''Ontdekfabriek''' (Discovery Factory) children's museum at [[Strijp-S]]\n\nEindhoven was home to the [[Evoluon]] [[science museum]], sponsored by [[Philips]]. The Evoluon building has evolved into a [[convention center|conference centre]].\n\n====Open-air art====\nThe Eindhoven [[public space]] contains many forms of artistic expression (a book published by the Eindhoven tourist board records 550 as of 2001 and more have been added since), with high \"concentrations\" of them in the [[parks]]. The [[Stadswandelpark]] for instance, contains over 30 works of [[modern art]]. There are also several other works of art on permanent display throughout the city, such as ''Flying Pins'' (by [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]], who considered the location on the southern stretch of the John F. Kennedylaan to be like a [[bowling alley]]) and ''Swing'' (a construct on the Karel de Grotelaan, which morphs into different geometric shapes as you move around it). There are also a number of statues of famous city inhabitants, such as [[Johan Frederik Rudolph van Hooff|Jan van Hooff]] (by [[Auke Hettema]], 1992) and [[Frits Philips]] (by [[Kees Verkade]]) on the Market Square. There is a statue of [[Anton Philips]] in front of the central railway station.\n[[File:Piazza Center Eindhoven.jpg|thumbnail|left|Piazza Centre as seen from Demer]]\n\nEindhoven is also, to some degree, open to forms of impromptu and alternative art. For example, the [[Berenkuil (Eindhoven)|Berenkuil]] is a freezone for [[graffiti]] artists in the city.\n\n=====Light art=====\n[[Strijp-S]] is a place for experimentiation with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting, which keeps the historic connection with Philips' past.<ref>'[http://www.ed.nl/regio/eindhoven/lichtproject-op-strijp-s-pakt-auroralia-award-in-lyon-1.4663520 Lichtproject op Strijp-S pakt Auroralia Award in Lyon]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.</ref>  Some [[light art]] includes the project '''Fakkel''' by Har Hollands.

Before that, Philips sponsored the [[Philips Ontspannings Centrum|POC]].\n\nParktheater Eindhoven is Eindhoven's stage for opera, cabaret, ballet etc. Opened in 1964, it has received over 250,000 visitors every year. With its 1,000 m2 it has one of the largest stages in the Netherlands. With a major renovation ending in 2007, the new Parktheater will receive an estimated 300,000 visitors a year.\n\nEindhoven's Plaza Futura is now a cinema featuring cultural movies, lectures and special cultural events.\n\nEspecially for students, [[Studium Generale Eindhoven]] organizes \"socially, culturally and intellectually formative events\".<ref name=\"StudiumGenerale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl/sg/ |title=Studium Generale Eindhoven |website=Studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722190708/http://www.studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl/sg/ |archive-date=22 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From within the student body, two [[Tuna (music)|Tunas]] provide entertainment from time to time at university and city events: [[Tuna Ciudad de Luz]] (''Tuna of the City of Light'') and the ladies tuna [[La Tuni\u00f1a]].<ref name=\"TunaCdL\">{{cite web|url=http://w3.tunacl.nl/index.php?id=en |title=Tuna Ciudad de Luz |publisher=Tuna Ciudad de Luz |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171203/http://w3.tunacl.nl/index.php?id=en |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"LaTunina\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stud.tue.nl/~tunina/index%20Engels.html |title=La Tuni\u00f1a |publisher=La Tuni\u00f1a |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171204/http://www.stud.tue.nl/~tunina/index%20Engels.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe general music and theatre scene in Eindhoven (in the broadest sense) is supported by a foundation called PopEi.<ref name=\"PopEi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popei.nl |title=Home &#124; POPEI |website=Popei.nl |date=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref> The purpose of this foundation is to support artistic groups with facilities, especially rehearsal stages and areas (housed in the old Philips location of [[Strijp-S]]) but also storage facilities. PopEi also provides a working environment for groups (through cafeteria facilities in [[Strijp-S]], so groups can have real working days) and provides some logistical support for organizing events.\n\n===Recreation===\nEindhoven has a lively recreational scene. For going out, there are numerous bars on the [[Market square]], Stratumseind (Stratum's End) which is the largest pub-street in the Netherlands, Dommelstraat, Wilhelmina square and throughout the rest of the city.
