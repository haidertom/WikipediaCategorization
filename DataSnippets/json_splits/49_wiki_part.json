As such its primary foreign policy focus is on its relations with other nations as a sovereign state compromising the three [[The unity of the Realm|constituent countries]]: [[Denmark]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].

In recent years, [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues, such as [[fishing]], [[whaling]] and geopolitical concerns.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], the Kingdom of Denmark ended its two-hundred-year-long policy of neutrality.

The alternative majority in these issues was because the Social liberal Party ([[Radikale Venstre]]) supported the governing majority in economic policy issues, but was against certain NATO policies and voted with the left in these issues. The conservative led Centre-right government accepted this variety of \"minority parliamentarism\", that is, without making it a question of the government's parliamentary survival.<ref name=\"stategov\"/>\nWith the end of the [[Cold War]], however, the Kingdom of Denmark has been supportive of U.S. policy objectives in the Alliance.\n\nDanes have a reputation as \"reluctant\" Europeans.

Its [[Sultan]] Umar Walashma (or his son Ali, according to another source) is recorded as having conquered the Sultanate of [[Shewa]] in 1285. Taddesse Tamrat explains Sultan Umar's military expedition as an effort to consolidate the Muslim territories in the Horn, in much the same way as Emperor [[Yekuno Amlak]] was attempting to unite the Christian territories in the highlands during the same period. These two states inevitably came into conflict over Shewa and territories further south. A lengthy war ensued, but the Muslim sultanates of the time were not strongly unified.

Further exploration by Henri Lambert, French Consular Agent at Aden, and Captain [[Fleuriot de Langle]] led to a treaty of friendship and assistance between France and the sultans of Raheita, [[Tadjoura]], and Gobaad, from whom the French purchased the anchorage of [[Obock]] in 1862.\n\nGrowing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. Between 1883-87, [[France]] signed various treaties with the then ruling [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, which allowed it to expand the [[protectorate]] to include the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].<ref name=\"Uwechue\">Raph Uwechue, ''Africa year book and who's who'', (Africa Journal Ltd.: 1977), p. 209.</ref><ref name=\"Chisholm\">Hugh Chisholm (ed.), ''The encyclop\u00e6dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p. 383.</ref> [[L\u00e9once Lagarde]] was subsequently installed as the protectorate's governor.

The French considered the presence of the Russians as a violation of their territorial rights and dispatched two [[gunboat]]s. The Russians were bombarded and after some loss of life, surrendered. The colonists were deported to [[Odessa]] and the dream of Russian expansion in East Africa came to an end in less than one year.\n[[Image:Djibouti-c1905.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Place Menelik, Djibouti, c1905.]]\n\nThe administrative capital was moved from Obock in 1896. The city of [[Djibouti, Djibouti|Djibouti]], which had a harbor with good access that attracted trade caravans crossing East Africa, became the new administrative capital. The [[Franco-Ethiopian railway]], linking Djibouti to the heart of Ethiopia, began in 1897 and reached [[Addis Ababa]] in June 1917, increasing the volume of trade passing through the port.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\nAfter the Italian [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]] in the mid-1930s, constant border skirmishes occurred between French forces in French Somaliland and Italian forces in [[Italian East Africa]]. In June 1940, during the early stages of [[World War II]], [[fall of France|France fell]] and the colony was then ruled by the pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Vichy France|Vichy (French) government]].\n\nBritish and Commonwealth forces fought the neighboring Italians during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].  In 1941, the Italians were defeated and the Vichy forces in French Somaliland were isolated. The Vichy French administration continued to hold out in the colony for over a year after the Italian collapse. In response, the British blockaded the port of [[Djibouti City]] but it could not prevent local French from providing information on the passing ship convoys. In 1942, about 4,000 [[British troops]] occupied the city. A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the [[Liberation of Paris]] in 1944.\n\n===Referendums===\nIn 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''], (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 {{ISBN|0472068989}}</ref> There was also reports of widespread [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.<ref>Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360 {{ISBN|1579582451}}.</ref> The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council.

This was both in acknowledgement of the large Afar constituency and to downplay the significance of the Somali composition (the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] being a Somali sub-clan).<ref name=\"Tioipeami\"/>\n\nThe French Territory of Afars and Issas also differed from French Somaliland in terms of government structure, as the position of Governor General changed to that of High Commissioner. A nine-member council of government was also implemented.\n\nWith a steadily enlarging Somali population, the likelihood of a third referendum appearing successful had grown even more dim. The prohibitive cost of maintaining the colony, France's last outpost on the continent, was another factor that compelled observers to doubt that the French would attempt to hold on to the territory.<ref name=\"Nwvol\"/>\n\nOn June 27, 1977, a [[Afars and Issas independence referendum, 1977|third vote]] took place.

A [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] broke out in 1991, between the government and a predominantly Afar rebel group, the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD). The FRUD signed a peace accord with the government in December 1994, ending the conflict. Two FRUD members were made cabinet members, and in the presidential elections of 1999 the FRUD campaigned in support of the RPP.\n\nAptidon resigned as president 1999, at the age of 83, after being elected to a fifth term in 1997. His successor was his nephew, [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]].\n\nOn May 12, 2001, President Ismail Omar Guelleh presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the FRUD, led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed, an Afar nationalist and former Gouled political ally. The peace accord successfully completed the peace process begun on February 7, 2000 in Paris. [[Ahmed Dini Ahmed]] represented the FRUD.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/djibouti/74136.htm|title=Djibouti (09/06)|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nIn the presidential election held April 8, 2005 Ismail Omar Guelleh was re-elected to a second 6-year term at the head of a multi-party coalition that included the FRUD and other major parties. A loose coalition of opposition parties again [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]. Currently, political power is shared by a Somali president and an Afar prime minister, with an Afar career diplomat as Foreign Minister and other cabinet posts roughly divided. However, Issas are predominate in the government, civil service, and the ruling party. That, together with a shortage of non-government employment, has bred resentment and continued political competition between the Issa Somalis and the Afars. In March 2006, Djibouti held its first regional elections and began implementing a decentralization plan. The broad pro-government coalition, including FRUD candidates, again ran unopposed when the government refused to meet opposition preconditions for participation. In the 2008 elections, the opposition Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP) party boycotted the election, leaving all 65 seats to the ruling RPP. Voter turnout figures were disputed. Guelleh was re-elected in the 2011 presidential election.\n\nDue to its strategic location at the mouth of the [[Bab el Mandeb]] gateway to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]], Djibouti also hosts various foreign military bases.

Home of the popular Grand Bara footrace.\n\n===Coasts===\nMost of Djibouti has been described as part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. The exception is a strip along the [[Red Sea]] coast, which is part of the [[Eritrean coastal desert]]; it is noted as an important migration route for birds of prey.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eritrean coastal desert|id=at1304}}</ref>\n\n==Djibouti Regions==\n[[File:Djiboutimap.png|thumb|200px|Map of the regions of Djibouti.]]\nThe area of the regions of [[Djibouti]] is set out in the table below.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Hot conditions prevail year-round along with winter rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (90 to 106&nbsp;\u00b0F), except at high elevations. In [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti city]], for instance, afternoon highs in April typically range from 28&nbsp;\u00b0C (82&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 34&nbsp;\u00b0C (93&nbsp;\u00b0F) in April. Nationally, mean daily minima generally vary between sites from about 15 to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (59 to 86&nbsp;\u00b0F). The greatest range in climate occurs in eastern Djibouti, where temperatures sometimes surpass 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (106&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July on the littoral plains and fall below freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.\n\n[[File:Djibouti's map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.png|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate types of Djibouti]]\nDjibouti has either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the high elevations. On the eastern seaboard, annual rainfall is less than 5 inches (131&nbsp;mm); in the central highlands, it is about 8 to 11 inches (200 to 300&nbsp;mm). Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically hot and dry. The climate conditions are highly variable within the country and vary locally by altitude. Summers are very humid along the coast but dry in the [[highland]]s. Heat waves are frequent. Annual precipitation amounts vary greatly from one year to another. In general, rain falls more frequently and extensively in the mountains. Sudden and brutal storms are also known to occur. Wadis turn for a few hours into raging torrents tearing everything in their path, and their course is regularized{{clarify|date=September 2013}}. Rainwater serves as an additional water supply for livestock and plants alongside seasonal watercourses. The highlands have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid.\n\nThe climate of the interior shows notable differences from the coastline. Especially when one rises, the temperature is pleasant: it is so in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]], [[Randa, Djibouti|Randa]] and Day (where temperatures of 10 \u00b0 have been recorded).\n\n===Climate charts of different locations in Djibouti===\n{{Location map+ | Djibouti | width = | float = right | border = | caption = | alt = | relief = 1 | overlay_image = | places ={{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Djibouti City]] | label_size = 100 | position = left | background = | mark = | marksize = | link = | lat_deg =11 | lat_min =35 | lat_sec = 18 |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 43 | lon_min = 8 | lon_sec = 42 | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Tadjoura]] | label_size = 100 | position = right | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 47 | lat_sec =  |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 53 | lon_sec =  | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Obock]] | label_size = 100 | position = right | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 58 | lat_sec = |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 43 | lon_min = 17 | lon_sec = | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Ali Sabieh]] | label_size = 100 | position = right | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 9 | lat_sec = |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 43 | lon_sec = | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Dikhil]] | label_size = 100 | position = left | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 6 | lat_sec = 30 |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 22 | lon_sec = 16 | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]] | label_size = 100 | position = bottom | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 31 | lat_sec =  |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 50 | lon_sec =  | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Dorra]] | label_size = 100 | position = right | lat_deg = 12 | lat_min = 9 | lat_sec =  |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 29 | lon_sec =  | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Ali Adde]] | label_size = 100 | position = bottom | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 7 | lat_sec = 50 |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 53 | lon_sec = 36 | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[`As `Ela|As Eyla]] | label_size = 100 | position = bottom | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 00 | lat_sec = |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 06 | lon_sec = | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Alaili Dadda`|Alaili Dadda]] | label_size = 100 | position = right | lat_deg = 12 | lat_min = 25 | lat_sec = |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 54 | lon_sec = | lon_dir = E }}\n{{Location map~ | Djibouti | label = [[Yoboki]] | label_size = 100 | position = left | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 31 | lat_sec = |  lat_dir = N | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 06 | lon_sec = | lon_dir = E }}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%;

Most of Djibouti\u2019s rainfall is in the four months, but over the last 25 years, the Djibouti's Ministry of Environment estimates that rainfall has decreased overall between 5 and 20 percent. It is predicted that in future years, there will be higher temperatures, lower rainfall, and longer [[drought]]s, leading to even less access to water. Moreover, seawater intrusion or fossil saltwater contamination of the limited freshwater aquifers due to groundwater overexploitation affect those who live close to the coastline<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Geochemical, multi-isotopic studies and geothermal potential evaluation of the complex Djibouti volcanic aquifer (Republic of Djibouti)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292718302063|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.07.019|via=}}</ref>.\n\nIn recent years, population growth has been increased rapidly with the addition of many refugees.\n\n===Natural resources===\nUnlike much of the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Middle East]] which is rich in lucrative crude oil, [[Djibouti]] has limited natural resources.

There is also a 65-member chamber of deputies, where representatives are popularly elected for terms of five years. Administratively, the country is divided into five regions and one city, with eleven additional [[Districts of Djibouti|district]] subdivisions. Djibouti is also part of various international organisations, including the [[United Nations]] and [[Arab League]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined \"yes\" vote by the sizeable [[Afar people|Afar]] ethnic group and resident Europeans.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''], (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 {{ISBN|0472068989}}</ref> There was also widespread [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.<ref>Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360 {{ISBN|1579582451}}.</ref> The majority of those who had voted \"no\" were [[Somali people|Somalis]] who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later.<ref name=Barrington2006/>\n[[File:Mahmoud Harbi.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Former Vice President of the Government Council, [[Mahmoud Harbi]].]]\nIn 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual union with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France.<ref name=\"Apcoatf\">''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor & Francis), p.132.</ref> However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.<ref name=\"Aufsnas\">American Universities Field Staff, ''Northeast Africa series'', Volume 15, Issue 1, (American Universities Field Staff.: 1968), p. 3.</ref> Shortly after the referendum was held, the former ''C\u00f4te fran\u00e7aise des Somalis'' (French Somaliland) was renamed to ''Territoire fran\u00e7ais des Afars et des Issas''.<ref name=\"Tioipeami\">Alvin J.

By the time of the national assembly elections in December 1992, only three had qualified. They are the ''Rassemblement Populaire Pour le Progres'' ([[People's Rally for Progress]]) (RPP) which was the only legal party from 1981 until 1992, the ''Parti du Renouveau D\u00e9mocratique'' (The [[Party for Democratic Renewal]]) (PRD), and the ''Parti National D\u00e9mocratique'' ([[National Democratic Party (Djibouti)|National Democratic Party]]) (PND). Only the RPP and the PRD contested the national assembly elections, and the PND withdrew, claiming that there were too many unanswered questions on the conduct of the elections and too many opportunities for government fraud. The RPP won all 65 seats in the national assembly, with a turnout of less than 50% of the electorate.\n\nIn 1999, President Aptidon's chief of staff, head of security, and key adviser for over 20 years, [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] was elected to the Presidency as the RPP candidate.<ref name=IRIN>{{cite web |title=DJIBOUTI: Guelleh sworn in for second presidential term |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47007 |publisher=IRIN Africa |date=May 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 20, 2013 }}</ref> He received 74% of the vote, the other 26% going to opposition candidate [[Moussa Ahmed Idriss]], of the [[Unified Djiboutian Opposition]] (ODU). For the first time since independence, no group [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]. Moussa Ahmed Idriss and the ODU later challenged the results based on election \"irregularities\" and the assertion that \"foreigners\" had voted in various districts of the capital; however, international and locally based observers considered the election to be generally fair, and cited only minor technical difficulties. Guelleh took the oath of office as the second President of the Republic of Djibouti on May 8, 1999, with the support of an alliance between the RPP and the government-recognised section of the Afar-led FRUD.\n[[File:Dileita Mohamed Dileita detail 090114-F-3682S-269.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dileita Mohamed Dileita]], former Prime Minister of Djibouti, Vice-President of the [[People's Rally for Progress]] (RPP), and President of the Union for a Presidential Majority (UMP).]]\nCurrently, political power is shared by a Somali Issa president and an Afar prime minister, with cabinet posts roughly divided. However, it is the Issas who dominate the government, civil service, and the ruling party, a situation that has bred resentment and political competition between the Somali Issas and the Afars.\n\nThe government is dominated by the Somali Issa Mamasen, who enjoy the support of the [[Somali clan]]s, especially the [[Isaaq]] (the clan of the current president's wife) and the [[Gadabuursi]] Dir (who are the second most prominent Somali clan in Djibouti politics). In early November 1991, civil war erupted in Djibouti between the government and a predominantly Afar rebel group, the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD). The FRUD signed a peace accord with the government in December 1994, ending the conflict. Two FRUD members were subsequently made cabinet members,<ref name=CIA-people>{{cite web|title=People and Society|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=February 26, 2013|date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> and in the presidential elections of 1999 the FRUD campaigned in support of the RPP. In February 2000, another branch of FRUD signed a peace accord with the government. On 12 May 2001, President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] presided over the signing of what is termed the final peace accord officially ending the decade-long civil war between the government and the armed faction of the FRUD. The treaty successfully completed the peace process begun on 7 February 2000 in Paris, with [[Ahmed Dini Ahmed]] representing the FRUD.\n\nOn 8 April 2005, President Guelleh was sworn in for his second six-year term after a [[Djiboutian presidential election, 2005|one-man election]]. He took 100% of the votes in a 78.9% turnout.<ref name=IRIN />\n\nIn early 2011, the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a [[2011 Djiboutian protests|series of protests]] against the long-serving government, which were associated with the larger [[Arab Spring]] demonstrations.

Djibouti''' is derived in large part from its strategic location on the [[Red Sea]]. [[Djibouti]] is mostly barren, with little development in the [[agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] sectors. The country has a harsh climate, a largely [[unskilled labour]] force, and limited natural resources. The country\u2019s most important economic asset is its strategic location connecting the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. As such, Djibouti\u2019s economy is commanded by the services sector, providing services as both a transit port for the region and as an international [[transshipment]] and [[refueling centre]].\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Djibouti experienced a [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] which had devastating effects on the economy. Since then, the country has benefited from political stability. In recent years, Djibouti has seen significant improvement in [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] stability, with its annual [[gross domestic product]] improving at an average of over 3 percent since 2003. This comes after a decade of negative or low growth. This is attributed to [[fiscal adjustment]] measures aimed at improving public financing, as well as reforms in port management.\n\nDespite the recent modest and stable growth, Djibouti is faced with many economic challenges, particularly job creation and poverty reduction. With an average annual [[population growth]] rate of 2.5 percent, the economy cannot significantly benefit national [[Per capita income|income per capita]] growth. [[Unemployment]] is extremely high at over 43 percent and is a major contributor to widespread [[poverty]]. Efforts are needed in creating conditions that will enhance [[private sector development]] and accumulate [[human capital]]. These conditions can be achieved through improvements in macroeconomic and fiscal framework, public administration, and [[labour market flexibility]].<ref name=\"Country Watch\">[http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&vcountry=49&topic=MAOVR Country Watch]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\nDjibouti was ranked the 177th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Economic performance==\n[[File:Djibuswalm.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\nBus down the central market in [[Djibouti City]].]]\nDjibouti has experienced stable economic growth in recent years as a result of achievements in macroeconomic adjustment efforts. Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption. [[Inflation]] has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the fixed peg of the [[Djiboutian franc|Djibouti franc]] to the [[US dollar]]. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Djibouti's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6 percent per year, from US$341 million in 1985 to US$1.5 billion in 2015.\n\nThe government fiscal balance is in deficit because the government has not been able to raise sufficient [[tax revenue]]s to cover expenses. In 2004, a substantial increase in expenditure resulted in a deterioration of the fiscal position. As a result, the government deficit increased to US$17 million in 2004 from US$7 million in 2003. But improvement in expenditure management brought down the fiscal deficit to US$11 million in 2005.<ref name=\"Country Watch\"/>\n\n==Balance of payments==\n\nDjibouti\u2019s merchandise trade balance has shown a large deficit. This is due to the country's enormous need for imports and narrow base of exports. Although Djibouti runs a substantial surplus in its services balance, the surplus has been smaller than the deficit in the merchandise trade balance. As a result, Djibouti's current account balance has been in deficit. There is very limited information for Djibouti\u2019s current account; the country\u2019s merchandise trade deficit was estimated at US$737 million in 2004.<ref name=\"Country Watch\"/>\n\n==Regional situation==\n\nPositioned on a primary shipping lane between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, Djibouti holds considerable strategic value in the international trade and shipping industries. The facilities of the [[Port of Djibouti]] are important to sea transportation companies for fuel bunkering and refuelling. Its transport facilities are used by several landlocked African countries for the re-export of their goods. Djibouti earns transit taxes and harbour fees from this trade, these form the bulk of government revenue. Threats of [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|pirates]] patrolling the Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Somalia, with the intentions of capturing large cargo ships, oil, and chemical tankers has created the need for larger nations such as the United States, France, and Japan to embed logistics bases or military camps from which they can defend their freight from piracy.  The port of Djibouti functions as a small [[France|French]] naval facility, and the [[United States]] has also stationed hundreds of troops in [[Camp Lemonnier]], Djibouti, its only African base, in an effort to counter terrorism in the region.<ref name=\"Country Watch\"/>  Recently China has stated they are in talks to build \u201clogistics facilities\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|title = China has no military ambition in Djibouti - Global Times|url = http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/955376.shtml|website = www.globaltimes.cn|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref> in [[Obock]] to provide support peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions near Somalia and the Gulf of Aden.  Additional international presence will increase both Djibouti\u2019s economic value as well its strategic importance in the region.\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Djibouti at market prices estimated by the [[International Monetary Fund]] with figures in millions of Djiboutian francs.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Two-thirds of inhabitants live in the capital and the remainder of the populace is mostly nomadic herders. Low amounts of rainfall limit crop production to fruits and vegetables, and requiring most food to be imported. The government provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling centre. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. All of these factors contribute to its heavy dependence on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAn unemployment rate of 50 percent continues to be a major problem. Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 percent over the last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term [[external debt]] and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.<ref>[http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&vcountry=49&topic=INFIC Country Watch]{{dead url|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Openness to foreign investment===\n\nThe [[Politics of Djibouti|government of Djibouti]] welcomes all foreign direct investment. Djibouti's assets include a strategic geographic location, an open trade regime, a stable currency, substantial tax breaks and other incentives. Potential areas of investment include [[Port of Djibouti|Djibouti's port]] and the telecommunications sectors. President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]]h first elected in 1999, has named [[privatization]], [[economic reform]], and increased [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] as top priorities for his government. The president pledged to seek the help of the international private sector to develop the country's infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nDjibouti has no major laws that would discourage incoming foreign investment. In principle there is no screening of investment or other discriminatory mechanisms. That said, certain sectors, most notably public utilities, are state owned and some parts are not currently open to investors. Conditions of the structural adjustment agreement recently signed by Djibouti and the [[International Monetary Fund]] stipulate increased privatization of [[parastatal]] and government-owned monopolies. There are no [[patent law]]s in Djibouti.<ref>[http://www.billanderson.com.au/Gazetteer-Patents.htm Bill Anderson]</ref>\n\nAs in most African nations, access to licenses and approvals is complicated not so much by law as by administrative procedures. In Djibouti, the administrative process has been characterized as a form of 'circular dependency.' For example, the finance ministry will issue a license only if an investor possesses an approved investor visa, while the interior ministry will only issue an investor visa to a licensed business. The Djiboutian government is increasingly realizing the importance of establishing a one-stop shop to facilitate the investment process.<ref name=\"Country Watch\"/>\n\n==Sectors==\n===Trade===\n[[File:Sabaibdjib.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Islamic Bank|Saba Islamic Bank]] branch in Djibouti City.]]\nPrincipal exports from the region transiting Djibouti are [[coffee]], [[salt]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], dried [[beans]], [[cereals]], other agricultural products, chalk, and wax. Djibouti itself has few exports, and the majority of its imports come from [[France]]. Most imports are consumed in Djibouti and the remainder goes to [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. Djibouti's unfavourable [[balance of trade]] is offset partially by invisible earnings such as transit taxes and harbour dues. In 1999, U.S. exports to Djibouti totalled $26.7 million while U.S. imports from Djibouti were less than $1 million. The [[Djibouti (city)|City of Djibouti]] has the only paved [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport|airport in the republic]].\n\n===Tourism===\nIn 2013, 63,000 foreign tourists visited Djibouti, [[Djibouti City]] is the principal tourist destination for visitors, revenues from tourism fell just US$43 million in 2013.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of companies based in Djibouti]]\n{{portalbar|Djibouti|Companies|Africa}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Djibouti/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n*[http://www.trademap.org/open_access/Index.aspx?proceed=true&reporter=262 Djibouti latest trade data on ITC Trade Map]\n* Richard Labelle, [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/33/034.html \"Djibouti ICT strategy and action plan\"], 28 May 2003\n* African Development Bank, [http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/ADB-BD-WP-2007-127-EN-DJIBOUTI-CSP-2007-2010.PDF \"Djibouti: Results-based country strategy paper, 2007-2010\"], October 2007\n* [http://nikolaynenovsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/07-AMAN-NENOVSKY-MAHAMOUD-DEF.pdf Le syst\u00e8me informel de transferts de fonds et le m\u00e9canisme automatique du Currency Board : compl\u00e9mentarit\u00e9 ou antagonisme ?

It was built between 1894 and 1917 by the French who ruled the country at the time as [[French Somaliland]]. The railway is no longer operational.\n\nCurrently (2018), Djibouti has 93 km of railways. The new [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]], an electrified [[standard gauge]] railway built by two Chinese government firms, began regular operations in January 2018. Its main purpose is to facilitate freight services between the Ethiopian hinterland and the Djiboutian [[Port of Doraleh]]. Railway services are provided by the ''Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Rail Transport Share Company'', a bi-national company between Ethiopia and Djibouti, which operates all commuter and freight railway services in the country. Djibouti has a total of four railway stations, of which three ([[Nagad railway station|Nagad]], [[Holhol]] and [[Ali Sabieh]]) can handle passenger traffic.\n\n==Roads==\n[[File:Djibouti National Highway.png|thumb|right|Map of Djibouti national highway]]\nThe Djiboutian highway system is named according to the road classification. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they connect all the major towns in Djibouti.  There is a total of {{convert|3,065|km}} of roads, with {{convert|1,379|km}} paved and {{convert|1,686|km}} unpaved, according to a 2000 estimate.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+Primary Highways of Djibouti\n|-\n!

The roadstead is well protected by reefs and by the configuration of the land. 95% of [[Ethiopia]]\u2019s imports and exports move through Djiboutian ports. Car ferries pass the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] from [[Djibouti City]] to [[Tadjoura]].\n\nFor decades, the Port of Djibouti was Djibouti's only freight port. It is now in the process of being replaced by the [[Port of Doraleh]] west of Djibouti City. In addition to the Port of Doraleh, which handles general cargo and oil imports, Djibouti currently (2018) has three other major ports for the import and export of bulk goods and livestock, the [[Tadjoura|Port of Tadjourah]] (potash), the [[Damerjog|Damerjog Port]] (livestock) and the [[Port of Goubet]] (salt).\n\n==Merchant marine==\nDjibouti has one ship with a volume of {{GRT|1,000|disp=long}} or over totaling {{GRT|1,369}}/{{DWT|3,030|metric|disp=long}} according to a 1999 estimate.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Airports==\n{{See also|List of airports in Djibouti}}\n[[File:Djibintairp.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Ilyushin Il-18]] aircraft and ferrying bus on the [[Djibouti\u2013Ambouli International Airport]] runway.]]\nIn 2004, there were an estimated 13 airports, only 3 of which had paved runways as of 2005. [[Djibouti\u2013Ambouli International Airport]], which is situated about 6&nbsp;km from the city of Djibouti, is the country's international air terminal. There are also local airports at [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]]. Beginning in 1963, the state-owned [[Air Djibouti]] also provided domestic service to various domestic centers and flew to many overseas destinations.

Djibouti Armed Forces are an important player in the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] and [[Red Sea]].\n\nIn 2015 General Zakaria Chiek Imbrahim was ''chief d'etat-major general'' (chief of staff) of the ''Forces Armees Djiboutiennes''. He assumed command in November 2013.<ref>http://www.hoa.africom.mil/story/7830/djiboutian-armed-forces-top-leader-retires-changes-command</ref>\n\nDjibouti has always been a very active member in the African Union and the Arab League.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Military history of Djibouti}}\nHistorically, Somali society accorded prestige to the warrior (''waranle'') and rewarded military prowess. Except for a man of religion (''wadaad''), and they were few in number, all Somali males were considered potential warriors.\nDjibouti's many [[Sultan]]ates each maintained regular troops. In the early Middle Ages, the conquest of [[Shewa]] by the [[Ifat Sultanate]] ignited a rivalry for supremacy with the [[Solomonic Dynasty]].\n[[File:Djibarmgen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A Djibouti Armed Forces commander.]]\nMany similar battles were fought between the succeeding [[Sultanate of Adal]] and the Solomonids, with both sides achieving victory and suffering defeat. During the protracted [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] (1529\u20131559), [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] defeated several [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Emperors]] and embarked on a conquest referred to as the ''Futuh Al-Habash'' (\"Conquest of Abyssinia\"), which brought three-quarters of [[Christian]] Abyssinia under the power of the [[Muslim]] Adal Sultanate.<ref>Saheed A. Adejumobi, ''The History of Ethiopia'', (Greenwood Press: 2006), p.178</ref><ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Volume 1, (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: 2005), p.163</ref> Al-Ghazi's forces and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies came close to extinguishing the ancient Ethiopian kingdom, but the Abyssinians managed to secure the assistance of [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]]'s [[Portugal|Portuguese]] troops and maintain their domain's autonomy. However, both polities in the process exhausted their resources and manpower, which resulted in the contraction of both powers and changed regional dynamics for centuries to come.\n\nThe [[Ogaden War]] (13 July 1977 \u2013 15 March 1978) was a conflict fought between the [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian government]] and [[Somalia|Somali government]]. The Djibouti government supported Somalia with [[military intelligence]]. In a notable illustration of the nature of Cold War alliances, the [[Soviet Union]] switched from supplying aid to Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the [[United States]]. This in turn prompted the U.S. to later start supporting [[Somalia]]. The war ended when Somali forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared.\n\nThe first war which involved the Djiboutian armed forces was the [[Djiboutian Civil War]] between the Djiboutian government, supported by [[France]], and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (''FRUD''). The war lasted from 1991 to 2001, although most of the hostilities ended when the moderate factions of FRUD signed a peace treaty with the government after suffering an extensive military setback when the government forces captured most of the rebel-held territory. A radical group continued to fight the government, but signed its own peace treaty in 2001. The war ended in a government victory, and FRUD became a political party.\n\n[[File:Djiboutian troops and Light armoured cars near the border.jpg|thumb|Djiboutian troops with light armoured cars near the border of [[Eritrea]]]]\nDjibouti has fought in clashes against [[Eritrea]] over the [[Ras Doumeira]] peninsula, which both countries claim to be under their sovereignty. The first clash occurred in 1996 after a nearly two-months stand-off. In 1999, a political crisis occurred when both sides accused each other for supporting its enemies. In 2008, the countries clashed again when Djibouti refused to return Eritrean deserters and Eritrea responded by firing at the Djiboutian forces. In the following battles, some 44 Djiboutian troops and some estimated 100 Eritreans were killed.\n\nIn 2011, Djibouti troops also joined the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]].<ref name=\"Sdpaimtja\">{{cite news|title=Somalia: Djibouti Peacekeepers Arrive in Mogadishu to Join Amisom|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201112211223.html|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2013, the Djibouti Armed Forces (DJAF) are composed of three branches: the Djibouti National Army, which consists of the Coastal Navy, the Djiboutian Air Force (Force Aerienne Djiboutienne, FAD), and the National Gendarmerie (GN). The Army is by far the largest, followed by the Air Force and Navy.

Djibouti maintains a modest military force of approximately 25,500 troops; the army is made of 16,000 troops (IISS 2016).

The army has concentrated on mobility in its equipment purchases, suitable for patrol duties and counterattacks but ill-suited for armoured warfare. The [[Djiboutian\u2013Eritrean border conflict|2008 border clashes]] at least temporarily swelled the ranks of the Djiboutian army, with retired personnel being recalled, but the military\u2019s size and capabilities are much reduced since the 1990s. The army to address more effectively its major defense disadvantage: [[Strategic depth|lack of strategic depth]]. Thus in the early 2000s it looked outward for a model of army organization that would best advance defensive capabilities by restructuring forces into smaller, more mobile units instead of traditional divisions. The official tasks of the armed forces include strengthening the country against external attack, and maintaining border security. Djiboutian troops continue to monitor its borders with [[Eritrea]], in the case of an attack. The Djiboutian Army is one of the small professional advanced armies in [[East Africa]].\n{{Location map many | Djibouti\n| width = 300\n| float = right\n| caption = <center>'''Djiboutian Army Infantry Regiments'''</center>\n| label1 = <small>Ali Sabieh Infantry Regiment </small>\n  | pos = right\n  | bg = white\n  | mark = Red pog.svg\n  | lat_deg = 11 | lat_min = 09\n  | lon_deg = 42 | lon_min = 43\n| label2 = <small>Dikhil Infantry Regiment </small>\n  | pos2 = left\n  | bg2 = white\n  | mark2 = Red pog.svg\n  | lat2_deg = 11 | lat2_min = 06\n  | lon2_deg = 42 | lon2_min = 22\n| label3 = <small>Obock Infantry Regiment </small>\n  | pos3 = left\n  | bg3 = white\n  | mark3 = Red pog.svg\n  | lat3_deg = 11 | lat3_min = 58\n  | lon3_deg = 43 | lon3_min = 17\n| label4 = <small>Tadjoura Infantry Regiment </small>\n  | pos4 = left\n  | bg4 = white\n  | mark4 = Red pog.svg\n  | lat4_deg = 11 | lat4_min = 47\n  | lon4_deg = 42 | lon4_min = 53\n| label5 = <small>Djibouti City Rapid Reaction Regiment </small>\n  | pos5 = right\n  | bg5 = white\n  | mark5 = Red pog.svg\n  | lat5_deg = 11 | lat5_min = 35\n  | lon5_deg = 43 | lon5_min = 08\n| label6 = <small>One Demining Company</small>\n  | pos6 = left\n  | bg6 = white\n  | mark6 = Red pog.svg\n  | lat6_deg = 11 | lat6_min = 31\n  | lon6_deg = 42 | lon6_min = 06\n}}\n\nIts maneuver units are:\n*One armoured regiment (comprising a reconnaissance squadron, three armoured squadrons and an anti-smuggling squadron)<ref name=IISS_2012_432 />\n*Four infantry regiments (each comprising three to four infantry companies and a support company)<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n**Regiment interarm\u00e9es de Tadjourah<ref>http://www.lanationdj.com/fad-regiments-interarmes-de-tadjourah-et-obock-de-jeunes-soldats-recoivent-leurs-premieres-instructions-militaires/</ref>\n**Regiment interarmees de Obock\n**Two other infantry regiments\n*One rapid reaction regiment (comprising four infantry companies and a support company)<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One Republican Guard regiment<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One artillery regiment<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One demining company<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One signals regiment<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One computer and information systems section<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One logistics regiment<ref name=IISS_2012_432 /> \n*One maintenance company<ref name=IISS_2012_432 />\n\n[[Italy]] delivered 10 howitzers M-109L (in 2013), tens IVECO trucks (ACM90, cranes, tankers, etc.), some IVECO armoured car Puma 4X4 and IVECO utility vehicles VM90.\n\nIn reforming the Djiboutian Army, most of the available financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces.

The Djiboutian Navy has about 1,000 regular personnel as of 2013, to protect national maritime rights and to support the nation's foreign policies. It is responsible for securing Djibouti's territorial waters and 314&nbsp;km seaboard. The force was launched two years after Djibouti gained its independence in 1977. Initially, it comprised the remnants of the Gendarmerie and was focused on port safety and traffic monitoring. This is an area known to have considerable fish stocks, sustaining an active fisheries industry. The acquisition of several boats from the US in 2006 considerably increased the navy's ability to patrol over longer distances and to remain at sea for several days at a time. Cooperation with the US and Yemeni navies is also increasing in an effort to protect and maintain the safety and security of the Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC). In 2004\n[[Italy]] delivered 2 former [[Corps of the Port Captaincies \u2013 Coast Guard|Italian Coast Guard]] ''[[:it:Classe Super Speranza|Classe 200]]'' patrol boats (ex CP 230 and CP 234 ) and 2 new type ''CP 500'' motorboats.\n\n===Djiboutian Air Force===\n{{Main|Djibouti Air Force}}\n\nThe Djiboutian Air Force (DAF) (French: Force A\u00e9rienne du Djibouti (FADD) was established as part of the Djibouti Armed Forces after the country obtained its independence on June 27, 1977. Its first aircraft included three Nord N.2501 Noratlas transport aircraft and an Allouette II helicopter presented to it by the French. In 1982, the Djibouti Air Force was augmented by two Aerospatiale AS.355F Ecureuil 2 helicopters and a Cessna U206G Stationair, this was followed in 1985 by a Cessna 402C Utiliner. In 1985, the Allouette II was withdrawn from use and put on display at Ambouli Air Base at Djibouti's airport. In 1987, the three N.2501 Noratlas were also retired and subsequently returned to France. New equipment came, in 1991, in the form of a Cessna 208 Caravan, followed by Russian types in the early nineties. These included four Mil Mi 2, six Mil Mi 8 and two Mil Mi 17 helicopters and a single Antonov An 28 light transport aircraft. Pilot training for the 360 men of the DAF, if necessary, is conducted in France with continued on type flight training at home.

These descendants of the early [[Ta\u00ednos]] were overthrown by the Kalinago tribe of the Caribs.\n\nThe [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], who settled here in the 14th century, called the island Waitikubuli, which means 'tall is her body'.  [[Christopher Columbus]] named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it - a Sunday ('Dom\u00e9nica' in Italian) - which fell on 3 November 1493 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]].\n\nDaunted by fierce resistance from the Caribs and discouraged by the absence of gold, the Spanish did not settle the island.  Many of the remaining Carib people live in Dominica's [[Carib Territory]], a {{convert|3700|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} district on Dominica's east coast.\n\n==Early European contacts==\nIn 1632, the French [[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]] claimed Dominica along with all the other 'Petite Antilles' but no settlement was attempted. Between 1642 and 1650 a French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island. In 1660 the French and English agreed that both Dominica and St. Vincent should not be settled, but instead left to the Caribs as neutral territory. Dominica was officially neutral for the next century, but the attraction of its resources remained; rival expeditions of English and French foresters were harvesting timber by the start  of the 18th century.<ref name=bn>\"Background note: Dominica\".

French woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] begin to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved people from West Africa to Dominica. In 1715, a revolt of \"poor white\" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoul\u00e9,<ref>P.C.

They set up smallholdings. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, M. Le Grand, took charge of the island with a basic French government; Dominica formally became a colony of France, and the island was divided into districts or \"quarters\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |title=Important Dates in Dominica's History |publisher=Lennox Honychurch Article |date=1990-07-05 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830091704/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |archivedate=2013-08-30 |df= }}</ref> Already installed in Martinique and Guadeloupe and cultivating sugar cane, the French gradually developed plantations in Dominica for coffee. They imported African slaves to fill the labor demands replacing the less cooperative indigenous Caribs.\n\nIn 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] a [[British expedition against Dominica]] led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Lord Rollo]] was successful and the island was conquered along with several other Caribbean islands. After France was defeated by Britain in the [[Seven Years' War]], it ceded the island to the British under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. In 1778, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the French [[Invasion of Dominica (1778)|mounted a successful invasion]] with the active cooperation of the population.

The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, returned the island to Britain. French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure.  The 1805 invasion burned much of [[Roseau]] to the ground.\n\nIn 1763, the British established a legislative assembly, representing only the white population. In 1831, reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes, the [[Brown Privilege Bill]] conferred political and social rights on free nonwhites. Three Blacks were elected to the legislative assembly the following year. The abolition of slavery in 1834 enabled Dominica by 1838 to become the only British Caribbean colony to have a Black-controlled legislature in the 19th century. Most Black legislators were small holders or merchants who held economic and social views diametrically opposed to the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.\n\nIn 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one composed of one-half elected members and one-half appointed. The elected legislators were outmaneuvered on numerous occasions by planters allied with colonial administrators. In 1871, Dominica became part of the [[Leeward Island Federation]]. The power of the Black population progressively eroded. Crown Colony government was re-established in 1896.\n\nFollowing World War I, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the representative government association. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924 and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration and was governed as part of the [[Windward Islands|Windwards]] until 1958, when it joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].\n\nIn 1961, a Dominica Labor Party government led by [[Edward Oliver LeBlanc]] was elected. After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom on February 27, 1967 and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. LeBlanc retired in 1974 and was replaced by [[Patrick John]] who became the islands' first [[Prime Minister]].\n\n==Hurricane David==\n\nIn August 1979, [[Hurricane David]], packing winds of {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, struck the island with devastating force.  Forty-two people were killed and 75% of the islanders' homes were destroyed or severely damaged.  Hurricane David was the most powerful and devastating hurricane ever recorded in Dominica until [[Hurricane Maria]] struck in 2017.\n\n==Independence: 1978 to present day==\n\nOn November 3, 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence by the United Kingdom.\n\nIndependence did little to solve problems stemming from centuries of economic [[underdevelopment]], and in mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government, led by [[Oliver Seraphin]]. It was replaced after the 1980 elections by a government led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]], the Caribbean's first female prime minister.  Within a year of her inauguration she survived two unsuccessful coups and in October 1983, as chairperson of the Organisation of East Caribbean States, endorsed the US [[Invasion of Grenada]].\n\nChronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980. By the end of the 1980s, the economy had made a healthy recovery, which weakened in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices.\n\nIn 1995 the government was defeated in elections by the United Workers Party of [[Edison James]]. James became prime minister, serving until the February 2000 elections, when the [[Dominica United Workers Party]] (DUWP) was defeated by the [[Dominica Labour Party]] (DLP), led by [[Rosie Douglas]]. He was a former [[socialist]] activist, and many feared that his approach to politics might be impractical. However, these were somewhat quieted when he formed a coalition with the more conservative Dominica Freedom Party. Douglas died suddenly after only eight months in office, on October 1, 2000, and was replaced by [[Pierre Charles]], also of the DLP. In 2003, [[Nicholas Liverpool]] was elected and sworn in as president, succeeding [[Vernon Shaw]]. On January 6, 2004, Prime Minister Pierre Charles, who had been suffering from heart problems since 2003, died. He became the second consecutive prime minister of Dominica to die in office of a heart attack. The foreign minister, [[Osborne Riviere]] immediately became prime minister, but the education minister, [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] succeeded him as prime minister and became the new leader of the Dominica Labour Party. Elections were held on May 5, 2005, with the ruling coalition maintaining power.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Dominica]]\n*[[Politics of Dominica]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n* Rouse, Irving.

Its coordinates are 15 25 N, 61 20 W.  It is known as \"The Nature Island of the Caribbean\" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and  fauna, which is protected by an extensive natural park system. It is the fourth largest island in the Eastern Caribbean with a population of people mainly from African descent.\n\nThe lowest point in the country is at [[sea level]] along the coast, and the highest is [[Morne Diablotins]] ({{convert|1447|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).  The extreme southwestern coast of the island includes a large collapsed submarine caldera. Portions of the exposed rim of this caldera form the southwestern tip of the island at Scott's Head. Natural resources include [[farming]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].\n\nGeographically, Dominica is distinctive in many ways. The country has one of the most rugged landscapes in the Caribbean, covered by a largely unexploited, multi-layered rain forest. It is also among the Earth's most rain-drenched lands, and the water runoff forms cascading rivers and natural pools. The island, home to rare species of wildlife, is considered by many as a beautiful, unspoiled tropical preserve. According to a popular West Indian belief, Dominica is the only New World territory that Columbus would still recognize.\n\nDominica is the largest and most northerly of the [[Windward Islands]]. The island faces the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the west. Its nearest neighbors are the French islands of Guadeloupe, some {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} north, and Martinique, about {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} south. Oblong-shaped and slightly smaller than New York City, Dominica is {{convert|750|km2|sqmi|0}} in area, {{convert|47|km|mi|0}} in length, and {{convert|29|km|mi|0}} in width. Roseau, the nation's capital and major port, is favorably situated on the sheltered, southwestern coast.\n\n==Climate==\nThe island's [[climate]] is tropical, moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] and heavy [[rain]]fall.\n\nDominica has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] and some areas bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with characteristically warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Excessive heat and humidity are tempered somewhat by a steady flow of the northeast trade winds, which periodically develop into hurricanes during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. The steep interior slopes also alter temperatures and winds. Because of the moderating effects of the surrounding ocean temperature ranges are slight. Average daytime temperatures generally vary from {{convert|26|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} in June. Diurnal ranges are usually no greater than {{convert|3|C-change|1}} in most places, but temperatures dipping to {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}} on the highest peaks are not uncommon.\n\nMost of the island's ample supply of water is brought by the trade winds. Although amounts vary with the location, rain is possible throughout the year, with the greatest monthly totals recorded from June through October. Average yearly rainfall along the windward east coast frequently exceeds {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and exposed mountainsides receive up to {{convert|9000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, among the highest accumulations in the [[Caribbean]] and the world. Totals on the leeward west coast, however, are only about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. Humidities are closely tied to rainfall patterns, with the highest values occurring on windward slopes and the lowest in sheltered areas. Relative humidity readings between 70 percent and 90 percent have been recorded in Roseau.\n\nHurricanes and severe winds, most likely to occur during the wettest months, occasionally are devastating. The most recent hurricanes of note were [[Hurricane David|David and maria]] and [[Hurricane Frederic|Frederic]] in August 1979 and [[Hurricane Allen|Allen]] in August 1980. The 1979 hurricanes caused over 40 deaths, 2,500 injuries, and extensive destruction of housing and crops. Many agricultural commodities were destroyed during the 1980 storm, and about 25 percent of the banana crop was destroyed by strong winds in 1984.\n\nDominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the [[hurricane]] region. In 1979, Dominica was hit directly by [[Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] [[Hurricane David]], causing widespread and extreme damage. On August 17, 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]], a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] at the time, hit the island. A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a [[landslide]] caused by the heavy rains fell onto their house.<ref name=\"Forbes Haiti preps\">{{cite news | title =  Hurricane Dean Gains Caribbean

in a clockwise direction:\n\n[[Agoucha Bay]]\n[[Sandwich Bay (Dominica)|Sandwich Bay]]\n[[Grand Baptiste Bay]]\n[[Petit Bapitiste Bay]] \n[[La Taille Bay]] [[Rough Bay]]\n[[Marigot Bay

\n[[Soufriere Bay]] \n[[Woodbridge Bay]]\n[[Prince Rupert Bay]]\n[[Douglas Bay (Dominica)|Douglas Bay]]\n\n==Geology==\nDominica was the last island to be formed in the Caribbean. The island was created by volcanic action about 26 mya. It lies upon two opposing tectonic plates. This explains why an island a bit bigger than [[Martha's Vineyard]] has mountains approaching {{convert|5000|ft|0}}.<ref Name=\"bg090118\">{{cite book | author = Holahan, David |title = Rugged Dominica worth the ruined sneakers | publisher = Boston Globe | date = January 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGeologically, Dominica is part of the rugged Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from {{convert|300|to|1400|m|0}} above sea level. Several east-west trending mountain spurs extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has level stretches no wider than {{convert|2000|m|0}}. The highest peak is Morne Diablotins, at {{convert|1447|m|0}}; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of {{convert|1423|m|0}}, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.\n\nThe interior features rugged [[mountain]]s of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. Volcanism is still quite evident on the island, the most popular examples being Dominica's [[Boiling Lake]] and \"valley of desolation.\" The boiling lake (the world's second largest) is within a crater and is fed by a waterfall - the boiling is believed to be caused by the heat of a magma chamber beneath the lake. The valley of desolation is a sulfurous valley of volcanic vents and hot springs that inhibits significant plant growth - in stark contrast to the surrounding rain forest. Technically dormant today, this caldera last erupted in 1880.<ref name=\"bg090118\"/> The area that exploded on 4 January 1880 was reported to be \"fully nine square miles\".<ref>''The Twillingate Sun'', February 10, 1881.</ref>\n\n[[File:Volcanic rock (Dominica).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Volcanic rock at Pagua Bay, Dominica]]\nDominica's rugged surface is marked by its volcanic past. Rock formations are mainly volcanic andesite and rhyolite, with fallen boulders and sharp-edged protrusions peppering slope bases. The light- to dark-hued clayey and sandy soils, derived from the rocks and decomposed vegetation, are generally fertile and porous. Only a few interior valleys and coastal strips are flat enough for soil accumulations of consequence, however. Although scores of mostly mild seismic shocks were recorded in 1986, volcanic eruptions ceased thousands of years ago. Sulfuric springs and steam vents, largely concentrated in the central and southern parts of the island, remain active, however. One of the largest springs, Boiling Lake, is located in the national park.\n\nDominica is water-rich with swift-flowing highland streams, which cascade into deep gorges and form natural pools and crater lakes. The streams are not navigable, but many are sources of hydroelectric power. Trafalgar Falls, located near the national park, is one of the most spectacular sites on the island. The falls has two twin waterfalls known as the mother and father.  The falls form a natural pool where the natives and tourist come to enjoy a nice cool bath. The principal rivers flowing westward into the Caribbean are the Layou and the Roseau, and the major one emptying eastward into the Atlantic is the Toulaman. The largest crater lake, called Boeri, is located in the national park. There are 83 \"significant\" waterways on the island out of a total of 365 rills and brooks.<ref name=\"bg090118\"/>\n\n===Natural history===\nThere are 172 species of birds, including four species of [[hummingbird]], [[broad-winged hawk]]s, [[yellow-crowned night heron]]s, and the [[brown trembler]].<ref name=\"bg090118\"/> Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe [[imperial parrot|sisserou parrot]] is Dominica's national bird and is indigenous to its mountain forests.\n\nThe [[Caribbean Sea]] offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many [[cetaceans]].  Most notably a small group of [[sperm whale]]s live in this area year round. These are shy animals, but there is a good chance of seeing them if you go out on a calm day. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include [[pilot whale]], [[Fraser's dolphin]], [[pantropical spotted dolphin]] and [[bottlenose dolphin]].  Less commonly seen animals include [[Cuvier's beaked whale]], [[false killer whale]], [[pygmy sperm whale]], [[dwarf sperm whale]], [[Risso's dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[humpback whale]] and [[Bryde's whale]].  This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in [[whale-watching]].\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n'''Map references:'''\nCentral America and the Caribbean\n\n'''Area:'''\n<br/>''total:''\n[[1 E8 m<sup>2</sup>|751 km<sup>2</sup>]]\n<br/>''land:''\n751&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n\n'''Coastline:'''\n148&nbsp;km\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\n<br/>''territorial sea:''\n{{convert|12|nmi|km mi|abbr=on|1}}\n<br/>''contiguous zone:''\n{{convert|24|nmi|km mi|abbr=on|1|lk=in}}\n<br/>''exclusive economic zone:''\n{{convert|200|nmi|km mi|abbr=on|1}}\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br/>''arable land:''\n8%\n<br/>''permanent crops:''\n24%\n<br/>''other:''\n68% (2012 est.)\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\nNA km<sup>2</sup>\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\nNA\n\n'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''\n<br/>''total:'' 0.02&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr\n<br/>''per capita:'' 244.1 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2004)\n\n'''Natural hazards:'''\nFlash floods are a constant threat; destructive hurricanes can be expected during the late summer months\n\n'''Environment - current issues:'''\nNA\n\n'''Environment - international agreements:'''\n<br/>\n''Party to:''\n[[Biodiversity]], Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Whaling\n\n==== Extreme points ====\n\n* Northernmost point \u2013 [[Carib Point]]\n* Southernmost point \u2013 Coast southeast of [[Scotts Head, Dominica|Scotts Head]]\n* Westernmost point \u2013 Cape in the southwest of [[Saint John Parish, Dominica|Saint John Parish]]\n* Easternmost point \u2013 Cape in the southeast of [[Saint David Parish, Dominica|Saint David Parish]]\n* Highest point \u2013 [[Morne Diablotins]]: 1447 m\n* Lowest point \u2013 [[Caribbean Sea]]: 0 m\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Geography of Dominica}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n* http://www.dominica-weekly.com/trafalgar-falls/\n* http://www.in-west-indies.com/dominica/discover/geography.htm{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* http://geography.about.com/library/cia/blcdominica.htm\n* http://www.thedominican.net/about/dominica.htm\n\n{{Geography of North America}}\n{{North America topic|Climate of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography of Dominica}}\n[[Category:Geography of Dominica| ]]", "sha1": "okvfvufc8ek6255aahurtshpncn0u9e"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Dominica", "ns": "0", "id": "8053", "revision": {"id": "850888717", "parentid": "836672444", "timestamp": "2018-07-18T16:51:07Z", "contributor": {"ip": "72.180.87.88"}, "comment": "/* Amerindians */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Dominica]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref name=\"2011 census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominica.gov.dm/cms/files/2011_census_report.pdf|format=PDF|title=2011 POPULATION AND HOUSING CENSUS|website=Dominica.gov.dm|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>\n|title       = Census population and average annual growth rate\n|percentages = pagr\n|1871 | 27178\n|1881 | 28211\n|1891 | 26841\n|1901 | 28894\n|1911 | 33863\n|1921 | 37059\n|1946 | 47624\n|1960 | 59916\n|1970 | 69549\n|1981 | 73795\n|1991 | 71183\n|2001 | 71242\n|2011 | 71293\n|{{UN_Population|Year}}{{UN_Population|ref}} |{{UN_Population|Dominica}} }}\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the preliminary 2011 census results [[Dominica]] has a population of 71,293.<ref name=\"2011 census\"/> The population growth rate is very low, due primarily to emigration to more prosperous Caribbean Islands, the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]].

According to the 2001 census there are only 2,001 [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] remaining (2.9% of the total population). A considerable growth occurred since the 1991 census when 1,634 [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] were counted (2.4% of the total population). \nThe [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] live in eight villages on the east coast of [[Dominica]].

The [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] constitute the largest Protestant group, with 6.7% of the population. [[Seventh-day Adventists]] are the second largest group (6.1%). The next largest group are [[Pentecostals]] (5.6% of the population), followed by [[Baptists]] (4.1%).  Other [[Christianity|Christians]] include [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (3.7%), Church of God (1.2%), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1.2%), [[Anglicanism]] (0.6%) and [[Brethren Christian]] (0.3%).\nDuring the past decades the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Anglicans]] has decreased, while the number of other Protestants has increased, especially [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Pentecostals]] (5.6% of the population) and [[Baptists]]).<ref name=\"2001 census\"/>\n\nThe number of non-Christians is small.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]].  The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[List of Presidents of Dominica|President]]\n|[[Charles Savarin]]\n|[[Dominica Labour Party|Labour Party]]\n|2 October 2013\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Dominica|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Roosevelt Skerritt]]\n|[[Dominica Labour Party|Labour Party]]\n|8 January 2004\n|}\n\nA president and prime minister make up the executive branch. Nominated by the prime minister in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, the president is elected for a 5-year term by the parliament. The president appoints as prime minister the person who command the majority of elected representatives in the parliament and also appoints, on the prime minister's recommendation, members of the parliament  as cabinet ministers. The prime minister and cabinet are responsible to the parliament and can be removed on a no-confidence vote.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|House of Assembly of Dominica}}\nThe [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] has 32 members.  Twenty-one members are elected for a five-year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]].  Nine members are senators appointed by the President; 5 on the advice of the Prime Minister and 4 on the advice of the leader of the opposition.  The [[Mr. Speaker|Speaker]] is elected by the elected members after an election.  There is also 1 ex-official member, the [[clerk of the house]].  The [[head of state]] - the [[president]] -is elected by the House of Assembly.  The regional representatives decide whether senators are to be elected or appointed.  If appointed, five are chosen by the president with the advice of the prime minister and four with the advice of the opposition leader. If elected, it is by vote of the regional representatives.  Elections for representatives and senators must be held at least every 5 years, although the prime minister can call elections any time.\n\nDominica has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]], with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.  Dominica was once a three-party system, but in the past few years the [[Dominica Labour Party]] and the greatly diminished [[Dominica Freedom Party]] have built a coalition.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Dominica|Elections in Dominica}}\n{{Dominican general election, 2009}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nDominica's legal system is based on English common law. There are three magistrate's courts and a High Court of Justice. Appeals can be made to the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court|Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal]] and, ultimately, to the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].\n\nThe Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court is headquartered in Saint Lucia, but at least one of its 16 High Court judges must reside in Dominica and preside over the High Court of Justice.

The country maintains missions in Washington, New York, London, and Brussels and is represented jointly with other [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) members in Canada. Dominica is also a member of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 1978 and of the [[World Bank]] and [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1979.\n\nAs a member of [[CARICOM]], in July 1994 Dominica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], designed to facilitate the departure of [[Haiti]]'s de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force, which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.\n\nIn May 1997, Prime Minister [[Edison James|James]] joined 14 other Caribbean leaders, and President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], during the first-ever U.S.-regional summit in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]]. The summit strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counternarcotics issues, finance and development, and trade. Dominica previously maintained official relations with the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as \"Taiwan\") instead of the [[People's Republic of China]], but on 23 March 2004, a joint communique was signed in Beijing, paving the way for diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic. Beijing responded to Dominica's severing relations with the Republic of China by giving them a $12 million aid package, which includes $6 million in [[budget support]] for the year 2004 and $1 million annually for six years.\n\nDominica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n==International disputes==\nDominica claims [[Venezuela]]n controlled [[Isla Aves]] (Known in Dominica as Bird Rock) located roughly 90 km. west of Dominica.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153618/http://www.nationnews.com/300078531512375.php Island talk for Caricom, Venezuela]</ref>\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:1%;\"| Formal relations began\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Algeria}}||{{dts|2006}}\n|\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations in June 2006.<ref>[http://www.thedominican.net/articles/newsdesk18.htm]</ref> \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Andorra}}||{{dts|}}\n|\nNo diplomatic relations were established yet with [[Andorra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exteriors.ad/en/bilateral-and-consular-affairs/bilateral-affairs |title=Andorra Foreign ministry}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Argentina}}||{{dts|1985}}\n|\nArgentina and Dominica established diplomatic relation on 13 June 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tratados.mrecic.gov.ar/tratado_ficha.php?id=8707 }}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Armenia}}||{{dts|}}\n|\nNo diplomatic relations were established yet with [[Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.am/en/country-by-country/dm/|title=Ministry Foreign Affairs of Armenia}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Australia}}||{{dts|}}\n|\nAustralia is represented in Dominica through its High Commission in Trinidad and Tobago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/geo/dominica/Pages/dominica.aspx|title=Department of Foreign Affairs of Australia}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Azerbaijan}}||{{dts|2011}}\n|\nAzerbaijan  and Dominica have established diplomatic relations in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominicavibes.dm/news-2668/ }}</ref> Prime Minister [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] made an official visit to Azerbaijan later this year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedominican.net/2011/08/skerrit-on-visit-to-azerbaijan.html }}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Barbados}}||{{dts|1978}}\n|\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on November 3, 1978.<ref>[https://www.foreign.gov.bb/documents/foreign-policy/22-countries-with-diplomaic-relations-with-barbados/file]</ref> \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Belarus}}||{{dts|2004}}\n|\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 9 July 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.by/en/press/news_mfa/dea8e636a61cc994.html |title=On Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Belarus and Dominica -

Soon after the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the [[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|cordillera central]] region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus, had also discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [[San Crist\u00f3bal, Dominican Republic|San Crist\u00f3bal]]-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]-Cotuy-[[Bonao]] triangle, while [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|Concepcion]], and Bonao became mining towns.

According to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\"  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepci\u00f3n, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The [[repartimiento]] of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.

After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain.

The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687 the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691 the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n=== 18th century ===\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present day Haiti)&nbsp;\u2013 which had a population that was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name=\"google48\"/> Its western, French neighbor [[Saint-Domingue]], became the wealthiest colony in the New World and had half a million inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic - THE FIRST COLONY|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. These practices of human traffic and terror facilitated capital accumulation. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n=== French rule ===\n{{Main|Era de Francia}}\n[[File:Battle of Santo Domingo (French and British ships).jpg|thumb|left|French and British ships fighting at the [[Battle of San Domingo|battle of Santo Domingo (1806)]]]]\nIn 1801, [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned. The British ejected the French and returned Santo Domingo to the Spaniards in 1809. The Spaniards not only tried to re-establish slavery in Santo Domingo, but many of them also mounted raiding expeditions into Haiti to capture blacks and enslave them as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Short History of Dominican Republic|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/DO-history.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===\n{{Main|Espa\u00f1a Boba|Republic of Spanish Haiti}}\nAfter a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.<ref>''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)</ref> In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (these two being [[Spanish Empire|Spanish possessions]] at the time), or [[Gran Colombia]], usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials who acquired their lands. The Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].\n\nAll levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army.

They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard|Charles H\u00e9rard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for H\u00e9rard and now championed Dominican independence.

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Encarta\"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\n\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and\u2026the number of wounded was very superior\u2026[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=The Siblings of Hispaniola: Political Union and Separation of Haiti and Santo Domingo, 1822-1844|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03272011-220809/unrestricted/DePena.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845.

These privileges not only served him to win the war, but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign, and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853 Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 1844-1899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=84-89525-17-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}\n[[File:GregorioLuperon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregorio Luperon]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]].

A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899\u20131902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power.

As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\n\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race.

It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48730|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest metropolitan area [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.\n\nThere are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that are part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''Cordillera Septentrional'' (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;\u2013 is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast.\n[[File:Constanza (15196384558).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] valley]]\nIn the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level), La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges. The more northerly of the two is the ''Sierra de Neiba'', while in the south the ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'', ''Sierra de Yamas\u00e1'', and ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''.\n\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas in the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land in the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.\n\nThe ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are in the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.\n\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\n[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with [[brackish water]].\n\nDominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946 it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast. This triggered a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. The wave was also recorded at Daytona Beach, Florida, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. The area remains at risk.

The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\n\n[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years. Notably due to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian boarder.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).\n\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;\u2013 Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;\u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n=== Bus service ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]\n{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}.

[[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\n\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').\n\nThe largest telecommunications company is [[Claro Rep\u00fablica Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;\u2013 part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil]]&nbsp;\u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services.

However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\n\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\n\n[[File:DOMREP-s-dom-panteon-innen.jpg|thumb|left|National pantheon in [[Santo Domingo]].]]\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Ta\u00edno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\n\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Ta\u00edno#Food and agriculture|Ta\u00edno]], and [[African cuisine|African]]. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''[[Mang\u00fa (dish)|mang\u00fa]]'' (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of ''mang\u00fa'' are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and  salad. \"La Bandera\" (literally \"The Flag\") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.\n\n[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Tostones, a fried plantain dish]]\n\nMeals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and saut\u00e9ed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad).

Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[To\u00f1o Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chich\u00ed Peralta]].\n\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|378}}\n[[File:Juan Luis Guerra en Acceso Total (6).jpg|thumb|Dominican singer [[Juan Luis Guerra]] is an icon of the Merengue music genre]]\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\n\n[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>\n\n[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\n\n[[Dominican rock]] is also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Oscar de la Renta by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Dominican native, fashion designer and perfume maker [[Oscar de la Renta]]]]\n\nThe country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Dise\u00f1o de Altos de Chav\u00f3n, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label.

The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana&nbsp;\u2013 Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\").

DIN is a German [[Civil registry|Registered]] [[Voluntary association|Association]] (''[[Eingetragener Verein|e.V.]]'') headquartered in [[Berlin]]. There are currently around thirty thousand DIN [[Technical standard|Standard]]s, covering nearly every field of technology.\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1917 as the ''{{lang|de|Normenausschu&szlig; der deutschen Industrie}}''<!-- szlig is old German spelling --> (NADI, \"Standardisation Committee of German Industry\"), the NADI was renamed ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Normenausschu&szlig;}}''<!-- szlig is old German spelling --> (DNA, \"German Standardisation Committee\") in 1926 to reflect that the organization now dealt with standardization issues in many fields; viz., not just for industrial products. In 1975 it was renamed again to ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Institut f&uuml;r Normung}}'', or 'DIN' and is recognized by the German government as the official national-standards body, representing German interests at the international and [[Europe]]an levels.\n\nThe [[acronym]], 'DIN' is often incorrectly expanded as ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}'' (\"German Industry Standard\"). This is largely due to the historic origin of the DIN as \"NADI\". The NADI indeed published their standards as ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}''). For example, the first published standard was '{{lang|de|DI-Norm 1}}' (about [[tapered pin]]s) in 1918. Many people still mistakenly associate DIN with the old ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' naming convention.\n\nOne of the earliest, and probably the best known, is [[DIN 476]] &mdash; the standard that introduced the [[ISO 216#A series|A-series]] [[paper size]]s in 1922 &mdash; adopted in 1975 as International Standard [[ISO 216]]. Common examples in modern technology include [[DIN connector|DIN]] and [[mini-DIN]] connectors for electronics, and the [[DIN rail]].\n\n==DIN standard designation==\nThe designation of a DIN [[Technical standard|standard]] shows its origin (# denotes a number):\n* ''DIN #'' is used for German standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. ''E DIN #'' is a draft standard and ''DIN V #'' is a preliminary standard.\n*''DIN EN #'' is used for the German edition of European standards.\n*''DIN ISO #'' is used for the German edition of ISO standards.\n*''DIN EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.\n\n==Examples of DIN standards==\n{{Main|List of DIN standards}}\n*[[DIN 476]]: international paper sizes (now [[ISO 216]] or DIN EN ISO 216)\n*[[DIN 1451]]: [[typeface]] used by [[Germany|German]] [[railway]]s and on [[traffic sign]]s\n*[[DIN 31635]]: [[romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] of the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic language]]\n*[[DIN 72552]]: electric terminal numbers in [[automobile]]s\n\n==See also==\n*[[Austrian Standards Institute]]\n*[[Swiss Association for Standardization]]\n*[[Die Br\u00fccke (institute)|Die Br\u00fccke]], an earlier German institute aiming to set standard paper sizes\n*[[DIN film speed]]\n*[[DIN connector]]\n*[[DQS | DQS - Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Zertifizierung von Managementsystemen]], a subsidiary of DIN\n*[[Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t | DGQ - Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t]], founded DQS in 1985 together with DIN\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.din.de DIN home page] (German version)\n*[http://www.din.de/en DIN home page] (English version)\n*[http://www.dinsml.net DIN online dictionary of classes, properties and units of measure]\n*[http://www.dqs-holding.com  DQS Holding GmbH]\n*[http://www.dqs.hk  DQS HK]\n\n{{Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung}}{{International Organization for Standardization}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deutsches Institut fur Normung}}\n[[Category:Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung| ]]\n[[Category:ISO member bodies]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1917]]\n[[Category:1917 establishments in Germany]]", "sha1": "bgqafs2gh2zubnlgbk090463ay6a3y4"}}, {"title": "History of the Dominican Republic", "ns": "0", "id": "8063", "revision": {"id": "865285358", "parentid": "865285109", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T23:12:10Z", "contributor": {"ip": "49.199.129.220"}, "comment": "/* Arrival of the Spanish */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arrival of Christopher Columbus.]]\n\nThe recorded '''history of the Dominican Republic''' began when the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]-born navigator [[Christopher Columbus]], working for the Spanish Crown, happened upon a large island in the region of the western Atlantic Ocean that later came to be known as the [[Caribbean]]. It was inhabited by the [[Ta\u00edno]], an [[Arawak]]an people, who variously called their island Ayiti, Bohio, or Quisqueya (Kiskeya). Columbus promptly claimed the island for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], naming it La Isla Espa\u00f1ola (\"the Spanish Island\"), later Latinized to [[Hispaniola]]. What would become the [[Dominican Republic]] was the Spanish [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]] until 1821 except for a time as a [[Era de Francia|French colony]] from 1795 to 1809. It was then part of a unified Hispaniola with Haiti from 1822 until 1844. In 1844, Dominican independence was proclaimed and the republic, which was often known as '''Santo Domingo''' until the early 20th century, maintained its independence except for a short Spanish occupation from 1861 to 1865 and occupation by the United States from 1916 to 1924.\n\n==Pre-Spanish history==\n{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}\nThe [[Ta\u00edno people]] called the island ''Quisqueya'' (mother of all lands) and ''Ayiti'' (land of high mountains). At the time of Columbus' arrival in 1492, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari\u00e9n, Magu\u00e1, Maguana, [[Jaragua, Hispaniola|Jaragua]], and Hig\u00fcey. These were ruled respectively by ''[[cacique]]s'' Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech\u00edo, and Cayacoa.\n\n==Spanish colony: 1492\u20131795==\n{{main|Captaincy General of Santo Domingo}}\n\n===Arrival of the Spanish===\n[[File:Massacre of Queen Anacaona and her subjects.jpg|thumb|In 1503 Queen Anacaona and hundreds of her people were massacred by Spanish governor [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] in crushing their revolt.]]\n[[Christopher Columbus]] reached the island of Hispa\u00f1ola on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]], in December 1492. On Columbus' second voyage in 1493 the colony of [[La Isabela]] was built on the northeast shore. Isabela nearly failed because of hunger and disease. In 1496 [[Santo Domingo]] was built and became the new capital. Here the New World's first cathedral was erected, and for a few decades Santo Domingo was also the administrative heart of the expanding empire. Before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors, men like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] lived and worked in Santo Domingo.\n\n{{ILL|Caonabo|es}}, the cacique, (leader or chief), of [[San Juan de la Maguana|Maguana]], one of five Taino geographical divisions on Hispaniola, attacked Columbus on January 13, 1493. Shooting arrows and wounding a few Spaniards, the Tainos halted the invaders' collection of provisions for Columbus's return trip to Spain. Caonabo struck again when his forces attacked and burned a fort built by Columbus, killing forty Spaniards. During the last trip of Christopher Columbus, in 1495, the Taino leader Guarionex, supported by Caonabo and other Taino leaders, staged the battle of La Vega Real against the Spanish in 1495. But while more than ten thousand Tainos fought against the Spanish, they succumbed to the power of the Spanish weaponry.\n\nWhen Guarionex attacked the Spanish again, in 1497, both he and Caonabo were caught by the Spanish and both shipped to Spain; on the journey Caonabo died\u2014according to legend, of rage\u2014and Guarionex drowned. His wife, [[Anacaona]], moved to the Xaragua division, where her brother, Bohechio, was cacique. After Bohechio's death, she became cacique and subsequently extended refuge and assistance to runaway enslaved Tainos and Africans.\n\n100,000 Tainos died from 1494\u201396, half of them by their own hand through self-starvation, poison, leaps from cliffs, etc.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clodfelter|first1=Micheal|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492\u20132015|date=2017|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=32|edition=4th}}</ref> The conquistador-turned-priest [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote an eyewitness history of the Spanish incursion into the island of Hispaniola that reported the conquistadors' almost feral misconduct:\n{{quote|Into this land of meek outcasts there came some Spaniards who immediately behaved like ravening wild beasts, wolves, tigers or lions that had been starved for many days.

[[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 |df= }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite, and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their hides. The enslaved population numbered between twenty and thirty thousand in the mid-sixteenth century and included mine, plantation, cattle ranch, and domestic laborers. A small Spanish ruling class of about twelve hundred monopolized political and economic power, and it used ''ordenanzas'' (laws) and violence to control the population of color.\n\nIn 1517, a guerrilla war between the colonizers and Taino and African forces was initiated by the Taino leader [[Enriquillo]]. Descending from the [[Baoruco Mountain Range|Bahoruco Mountains]] with his troops, Enriquillo killed Spaniards, devastated farms and property, and took Africans back with him. The crown appointed General [[:es:Francisco de Barrionuevo|Francisco Barrionuevo]], a veteran of many battles in Spain, as captain to lead the war against Enriquillo. Barrionuevo opted to negotiate, realizing that violence had not worked and that resources for more armed actions were scarce. In 1533 he met Enriquillo on what is today's Cabrito Island, in the middle of Lake Jaragua (now Enriquillo Lake) and reached a peace agreement that granted Enriquillo and his troops freedom and land.\n\nThe first known armed rebellion of enslaved Africans occurred in 1521. On Christmas Eve two hundred enslaved workers fled the plantation of [[Diego Columbus]], located on the Isabela River near Santo Domingo, and headed south toward [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]]. Others from plantations in Nigua, San Crist\u00f3bal, and Ban\u00ed joined them on the march, burning plantations and killing several Spaniards. According to official records, they stopped next at the Ocoa plantation, with the intention of killing more whites and recruiting more enslaved blacks and Indians, then moved on to Azua. After being informed of the insurrection, Columbus recruited a small army, which, mounted on horseback and shouting their battle cry \u201c[[Santiago!|Santiago]],\u201d headed south in pursuit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=83}}</ref> In the meantime, the rebels entered the plantation of Melchor de Castro near the Nizao River where they killed one Spaniard, sacked the house, and freed more enslaved persons, including Indians. Columbus's army confronted the rebels at the Nizao, the Spanish shooting at them with guns and the rebels responding by throwing stones and logs. Five days later the Spanish attacked again. They caught several rebels, whom they executed by lynching along the colonial road, but many more had escaped to face later attacks, in which more were killed or apprehended.\n\nBy the mid-sixteenth century there were an estimated seven thousand [[Maroon (people)|maroons]] (runaway slaves) beyond Spanish control on Hispaniola. The Bahoruco Mountains were their main area of concentration, although Africans had escaped to other areas of the island as well. From their refuges, they descended to attack the Spanish. In 1546 the slave Diego de Guzman led an insurrection that swept through the San Juan de la Maguana area, after which he escaped to the Bahoruco Mountains. After his capture, de Guzman was savagely killed and some of his fellow rebels were burned alive, others burned with branding irons, others hung, and others had their feet cut off. The most extended insurrection was led by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lemba]]. For fifteen years Lemba attacked Spanish towns, plantations, and farms with an army of four hundred Africans. Lemba was eventually caught and was executed in 1548. His head was mounted on the door that connected the Fort of San Gil (today Fort Ozama) to Fort Conde, and for centuries it was called \u201cthe Lemba door.\u201d Insurrections continued to burden the colony's tranquility and economy. From 1548 to the end of the sixteenth century, maroons attacked farms, plantations, and villages. By 1560 the colony was unable to recruit and pay troops to pursue the rebels.\n\nWhile sugar cane dramatically increased Spain's earnings on the island, large numbers of the newly imported slaves fled into the nearly impassable mountain ranges in the island's interior, joining the growing communities of ''cimarr\u00f3nes''\u2014literally, 'wild animals'. By the 1530s, ''[[maroon (people)|cimarr\u00f3n]]'' bands had become so numerous that in rural areas the Spaniards could only safely travel outside their plantations in large armed groups. Beginning in the 1520s, the [[Caribbean Sea]] was raided by increasingly numerous French pirates. In 1541 Spain authorized the construction of Santo Domingo's fortified wall, and in 1560 decided to restrict sea travel to enormous, well-armed convoys. In another move, which would destroy [[Hispaniola]]'s sugar industry, in 1561 [[Havana]], more strategically located in relation to the [[Gulf Stream]], was selected as the designated stopping point for the merchant ''[[flota system|flotas]],'' which had a royal monopoly on commerce with the Americas. In 1564, the island's main inland cities [[Santiago de los Caballeros]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de la Vega]] were destroyed by an earthquake. In the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas.\n[[File:Hidalgo.JPG|thumb|A sixteenth-century French depiction of a Hidalgo (non-royal blooded Spanish noble) in the Spanish colonies]]\nWith the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Ta\u00edno descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers.\n\nIn 1586, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] captured the city of Santo Domingo, collecting a ransom for its return to Spanish rule. A third of the city lay in ruins and almost all of its civic, military and religious buildings had been either damaged or destroyed. During his occupation of Santo Domingo,  Drake sent a black boy with a message to the governor. A [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalgo]] who was standing by considered this an insult and ran the boy through with his sword.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waugh|first1=Alec|title=A Family of Islands|publisher=A&C Black}}</ref> The English commander, infuriated, proceeded to the spot where the murder had been committed and had two friars hanged.

The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren on the Spanish main.\n\n===Seventeenth century===\n[[File:AMH-6754-NA Bird's eye view of the city of Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Johannes Vingboons]] of Santo Domingo, c. 1665]]\nIn 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island were carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe, and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of Santo Domingo.<ref>Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p.54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990</ref> This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.<ref>''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 352</ref>  Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops \u2013 many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships. The settlements of La Yaguana, and Bayaja, on the west and north coasts respectively of modern-day Haiti were burned, as were the settlements of Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata on the north coast and San Juan de la Maguana in the south western area of the modern day Dominican Republic.\n\nThe withdrawal of the colonial government from the northern coastal region opened the way for French [[buccaneer]]s, who had a base on [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga Island]], off the northwest coast of present-day Haiti, to settle on Hispaniola in the mid-seventeenth century. Although the Spanish destroyed the buccaneers' settlements several times, the determined French would not be deterred or expelled. The creation of the [[French West India Company]] in 1664 signalled France's intention to colonize western Hispaniola. Intermittent warfare went on between French and Spanish settlers over the next three decades; however, Spain, hard-pressed by warfare in Europe, could not maintain a garrison in Santo Domingo sufficient to secure the entire island against encroachment. In 1697, under the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Spain ceded the western third of the island to France.\n\nIn 1655, [[Oliver Cromwell]] dispatched a fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Sir William Penn]], to conquer Santo Domingo. A Spanish defending force of perhaps 400\u2013600 men, mostly militia, repulsed a landing force of 9,000 men.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Harrington, Matthew Craig|title=\"The Worke Wee May Doe in the World\" the Western Design and the Anglo-Spanish Struggle for the Caribbean, 1654\u20131655.|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:182408/datastream/PDF/view|publisher=Florida State University|date=2004}}</ref> Yet although the English had failed to overrun the island, they nevertheless [[Invasion of Jamaica|seized nearby Jamaica]], and other foreign strongholds subsequently began multiplying throughout the West Indies. Madrid sought to contest such encroachments by using Santo Domingo as an advance military base, but Spanish power was by now too depleted to expel the rival colonies. The city itself was furthermore subjected to a [[smallpox]] epidemic, cacao blight, and hurricane in 1666; another storm two years later; a second epidemic in 1669; a third hurricane in September 1672; plus an earthquake in May 1673 that killed two dozen residents.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia|date=2005|page=94}}</ref>\n\nDuring this seventeenth \u201ccentury of misery,\u201d the Spanish on Hispaniola continued to persecute maroons living peacefully in the island's interior mountains and valleys. With little to show for it, this policy of armed harassment added more public expense to a weak colonial economy, and the financial recovery of the Spanish colony in the eighteenth century led to increased slave insurrections and marronage.\n\n===Eighteenth century===\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The population of Santo Domingo grew from about 6,000 in 1737 to approximately 125,000 in 1790. Of this number, about 40,000 were white landowners, about 25,000 were mulatto freedmen, and some 60,000 were slaves. However, it remained poor and neglected, particularly in contrast with its western, French neighbor [[Saint-Domingue]], which became the wealthiest colony in the New World and had half a million inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic \u2013 THE FIRST COLONY|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, said to themselves: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. These practices of human traffic and terror facilitated capital accumulation. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref>\n\nDominicans constituted one of the many diverse units which fought alongside Spanish forces under [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]] during the [[Gulf Coast campaign|conquest of British West Florida]] (1779\u201381).<ref>{{cite book |title=Latino Chronology: Chronologies of the American Mosaic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWX5d27NkFgC&pg=PA36&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Spain and the Independence of the United States: An Intrinsic Gift |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCbhQZFdZlYC&pg=PA170&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAs restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in [[War of the Pyrenees|Europe]]. The Spanish colony was ceded first to France in 1795 as part of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] between the defeated Spanish and the French, then it was invaded by the British in 1796.<ref name=\"Hartlyn1998\"/> Five years later, black slaves in rebellion invaded from Saint-Domingue. The devastated Spanish-speaking colony was then occupied by the French in 1802, in spite of the dramatic defeat of [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] forces at the hands of the former French slaves who proclaimed the independent Republic of [[Haiti]] in 1804. Santo Domingo was invaded again by Haitians in 1805 and then yet again by the British in 1809.<ref name=\"Hartlyn1998\"/> The Spanish reclaimed it later that year, but found the colony in economic ruins and demographic decline.<ref name=\"Hartlyn1998\"/>\n\n==Spanish colony: 1809\u201321==\n{{main|Espa\u00f1a Boba}}\nThe population of the new Spanish colony stood at approximately 104,000. Of this number, about 30,000 were slaves, and the rest a mixture of white, Indian, and black. The European Spaniards were few, and consisted principally of [[Catalans]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=William|title=Present state of the Spanish colonies; including a particular report of Hispa\u00f1ola|date=1810|page=133}}</ref> In 1812, a group of blacks and mulattoes staged a rebellion, with the goal of annexation to the Republic of Haiti. On August 15 and 16, mulattoes Jos\u00e9 Leocadio, Pedro Seda, and Pedro Henriquez, with other conspirators, attacked the Mendoza hacienda in Mojarra in the municipality of Guerra near the capital. Seda and Henriquez were apprehended and executed; Leocadio was captured within days, hanged, dismembered, and boiled in oil. A year later enslaved laborers in the rural community El Chav\u00f3n also rebelled, but they were quickly caught and executed.\n\nSpain's hold over Santo Domingo remained precarious. The arrival of the fugitive [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and his followers in Haiti in 1815 alarmed the Spanish authorities in Santo Domingo. Following the rebellion of the Army in Spain during 1820, which restored the liberal constitution, some of the colonial administrators in Santo Domingo broke with the mother country; and on December 1, 1821, the Spanish Lieutenant Governor, [[Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres]], proclaimed the independence of \"[[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]].\"\n\nDominican leaders\u2014recognizing their vulnerability both to Spanish and to Haitian attack and also seeking to maintain their slaves as property\u2014attempted to annex themselves to [[Gran Colombia]]. While this request was in transit, [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the ruler of Haiti, invaded Santo Domingo on February 9 with a 10,000-man army. Having no capacity to resist, N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres surrendered the capital on February 9, 1822.\n\n==Unification of Hispaniola 1822\u201344==\n{{main|Unification of Hispaniola}}\nThe twenty-two-year Haitian occupation that followed is recalled by Dominicans as a period of brutal military rule, though the reality is more complex. It led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and eliminate traditional customs such as [[cockfighting]]. It reinforced Dominicans' perceptions of themselves as different from Haitians in \"language, race, religion and domestic customs.\"<ref>Moya Pons, Frank ''Between Slavery and Free Labor: The Spanish-speaking Caribbean in the 19th Century''. Baltimore; Johns Hopkins University Press 1985</ref> Yet, this was also a period that definitively ended slavery as an institution in the eastern part of the island.\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade whites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Most emigrated to the Spanish colonies of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], or to independent Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the [[Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. [[Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino|Santo Domingo\u2019s university]], the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, lacking students, teachers, and resources, closed down. In order to receive diplomatic recognition from [[France]], Haiti was forced to pay an indemnity of 150 million francs to the former French colonists, which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, and Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the eastern part of the island. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint.\n\nAttempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's ''Code Rural''.<ref>''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)</ref> In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\n==Independence: First Republic 1844\u201361==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= War of Independence\n|partof=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date= 1844\u20131856\n|place=[[Hispaniola]]\n|casus=\n|territory= \n|result= Dominican Independence\n|combatant1={{flagdeco|Dominican Republic|1844}} [[Dominican Republic]]\n|combatant2={{flag|Haiti}}\n|commander1={{flagdeco|Dominican Republic|1844}} [[Pedro Santana]]<br /> {{flagdeco|Dominican Republic|1844}} [[Antonio Duverg\u00e9]] <br /> {{flagdeco|Dominican Republic|1844}} Felipe Alfau<br />{{flagdeco|Dominican Republic|1844}} Juan B.

A short time later, they were joined by [[Ram\u00f3n Mat\u00edas Mella]], and [[Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez]]. In 1843 they allied with a Haitian movement in overthrowing Boyer. Because they had revealed themselves as revolutionaries working for Dominican independence, the new Haitian president, [[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard]], exiled or imprisoned the leading ''Trinitarios'' (Trinitarians). At the same time, [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]], an [[Azua Province|Azua]] mahogany exporter and deputy in the [[National Assembly of Ha\u00efti|Haitian National Assembly]], was negotiating with the French Consul-General for the establishment of a French protectorate. In an uprising timed to preempt B\u00e1ez, on February 27, 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle-rancher from [[El Seibo]] who commanded a private army of [[peon]]s who worked on his estates.\n\n===First Republic===\n{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}\nThe Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844.

These privileges not only served him to win the war, but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nH\u00e9rard sent three columns of Haitian troops, each numbering 10,000 men, to reestablish his authority.

On September 17, Dominican Gen. [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Puello]] defeated the Haitian vanguard near the frontier at Estrelleta where the Dominican \"square\" repulsed with bayonets a Haitian cavalry charge. The Dominicans suffered no deaths during the battle and only three wounded. On September 27, 1845, Dominican Gen. Francisco Antonio Salcedo defeated the Haitian army at the Battle of Beler. Salcedo was supported by  Adm. Juan Bautista Cambiaso's squadron of three schooners, which blockaded the Haitian port of [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].<ref name=Wars/> Haitian losses were 350 killed and 10 captured; the Dominicans lost 16 killed.\n\nSantana used the ever-present threat of Haitian invasion as a justification for consolidating dictatorial powers. For the Dominican elite\u2014mostly landowners, merchants and priests\u2014the threat of re-annexation by more populous [[Haiti]] was sufficient to seek protection from a [[Power (international relations)|foreign power]]. Offering the deepwater harbor of [[Saman\u00e1 (town)|Saman\u00e1]] bay as bait, over the next two decades, negotiations were made with Britain, France, the United States and Spain to declare a protectorate over the country.\n\nThe constant threat and fear of renewed Haitian intervention required all men of fighting age to take up arms in defense against the Haitian military. Theoretically, fighting age was generally defined as between fifteen and eighteen years of age to forty or fifty years. Despite wide, popular glorification of military service, many in the ranks of the [[Dominican Army|Liberation Army]] were mutinous and desertion rates were high despite penalties as severe as death for shirking the obligation of military service.\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the ''[[hacienda]]'' as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the [[Cibao Valley]], the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing [[tobacco]] for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]] and [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]]. Santana antagonized the [[Cibao]] farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value.  In 1848, he was forced to resign, and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter returning to lead Dominican forces against a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo, deposing Jimenes. At his behest, Congress elected [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. B\u00e1ez determined to take the offensive against Haiti. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. In 1853 Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing the last Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. The Cibanian tobacco planters, who were ruined when inflation ensued, revolted, recalling Santana from exile to lead their rebellion. After a year of civil war, Santana seized Santo Domingo and installed himself as president.\n\nIn 1860, a group of Americans tried unsuccessfully to take over the small Dominican island of [[Alto Velo Claim|Alto Velo]] off the southwestern border coast of Hispaniola.\n\n==Spanish colony: 1861\u201365==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= War of Restoration\n|partof=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date= August 16, 1863 \u2013 July 15, 1865<br>({{Age in years, months, weeks and days|month1=08|day1=16|year1=1863|month2=07|day2=15|year2=1865}})\n|place=[[Dominican Republic]]\n|territory=\n|result= Restoration of Dominican sovereignty \n|combatant1={{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Dominican Republic]]\n|combatant2={{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]\n|commander1={{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]]<br>{{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[:es:Gaspar Polanco|Gaspar Polanco]]<br>{{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Santiago Rodr\u00edguez Masag\u00f3|Santiago Rodr\u00edguez]]<br>{{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Furcy Fondeur]]\n|commander2={{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Isabel II of Spain|Isabel II]]<br>{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[:es:Manuel Buceta|Manuel Buceta]]<br>{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Pedro Santana]]<br>{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro|Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara]]\n|strength1=30,000<ref name=Routledge>{{cite book|title=Peasants and Religion: A Socioeconomic Study of Dios Olivorio and the Palma Sola Religion in the Dominican Republic|page=569}}</ref>\n|strength2=63,000<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dominican Republic and the Beginning of a Revolutionary Cycle in the Spanish Caribbean: 1861\u20131898|page=78}}</ref>\n|casualties1=\n|casualties2=\n|casualties3=\n|notes=\n}}\nPedro Santana inherited a bankrupt government on the brink of collapse. Having failed in his initial bids to secure annexation by the U.S. or France, Santana initiated negotiations with Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] and the Captain-General of Cuba to have the island reconverted into a Spanish colony. The [[American Civil War]] rendered the United States incapable of enforcing the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. In Spain, Prime Minister [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]] advocated renewed colonial expansion, waging a campaign in northern [[Morocco]] that conquered the city of [[Tetuan]]. In March 1861, Santana officially restored the Dominican Republic to Spain. \n\nSantana initially was named Capitan-General of the new Spanish province, but it soon became obvious that Spanish authorities planned to deprive him of his power, leading him to resign in 1862. Restrictions on trade, discrimination against the mulatto majority, and an unpopular campaign by the new Spanish Archbishop, Bienvenido Monz\u00f3n, against extramarital unions, which were widespread after decades of abandonment by the Catholic Church, all fed resentment of Spanish rule.\n\nMonz\u00f3n also persecuted [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], whose activities were widespread before the annexation, barring them from communion until they canted their vows and gave up their Masonic documents and practices. Monz\u00f3n actively persecuted Protestants as well. Protestant churches in Saman\u00e1 and Santo Domingo were taken over, burned, or confiscated for military purposes, forcing many Dominican Protestants to consider moving to Haiti in search of religious toleration.\n\nOn August 16, 1863, a national war of restoration began in Santiago, where the rebels established a provisional government. \u201cBefore God, the entire world, and the throne of Castile, just and legal reasons have obliged us to take arms to restore the Dominican Republic and reconquer our liberty,\u201d the provisional government's declaration of independence read.<ref>{{cite news|title=THE INSURRECTION IN HAYTI.; Translation of the Declaration of Independence.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/28/news/the-insurrection-in-hayti-translation-of-the-declaration-of-independence.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 28, 1863}}</ref> Dominicans were divided.

The rebels had possession of three forts which face the Puerto Plata road. They undertook to make a general assault on the fort where the Spanish troops were concentrated. The besieged forces let the enemy's bands come near, and when within musket range opened a tremendous fire of artillery, which, committing great destruction, drove them back in disorder. They, however, tried their luck again, and this time set fire to the houses of the town in different parts and made their attack in the midst of the conflagration. Spanish reinforcements arrived and charged the insurgents, who received them with [[grapeshot]] and musketry from the three forts which they held. The insurgents were repulsed and the forts retaken at the point of the bayonet. The garrison of Santiago abandoned the city and marched to Puerto Plata, the main northern port, attacked by Dominicans all the way. The Spaniards reportedly lost 1,300 men.<ref>{{cite news|title=OUR HAVANA CORRESPONDENCE.; Later News from St. Domingo Details of the {{sic|Sei|ge|hide=y}} of Santiago de los Caballeros {{sic|Withdraw|l|hide=y}}<!-- Misspelled on the website anyway; anyone have an NYT account to look at the original paper? --> of the Spanish Troops with Heavy Loss From Venezuela.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/09/news/our-havana-correspondence-later-st-domingo-details-seige-santiago-de-los.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=October 9, 1863}}</ref> They joined the garrison in the fort at Puerto Plata, leaving the city to be pillaged by the rebels. Eventually 600 Spanish sallied out and drove off the rebels, with help from the cannon of the fort, but by then the city had been plundered and burnt almost out of existence. The damage to Santiago and Puerto Plata was estimated at $5,000,000. By mid-November virtually the whole garrisons of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] were deployed on Santo Domingo and 8,000 troops had been sent from Europe, diverted from deployment in Morocco. The Spanish navy had complete command of the sea and used a fleet of paddle wheel steamers to transport troops to, and around, the island.\n\nAs the fighting continued, racist incidents became more acute. Spanish soldiers were openly hostile to Dominicans of color, and incidents of unprovoked violence against black Dominicans and migrants in the towns proliferated.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Civil Wars: The United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Crisis of the 1860s|page=159}}</ref> Perhaps because of the fright that Spain would seek to make [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] an enslaved twin of Cuba, Dominicans were said to fight like \u201csupernatural fiends\u201d with a \u201cdesperate\u201d intensity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Gerald|title=Confronting Black Jacobins: The U.S., the Haitian Revolution, and the Origins of the Dominican Republic|date=2015|publisher=NYU Press|page=269}}</ref> By early 1864, the Spanish army, unable to contain guerrilla resistance, had suffered 1,000 killed in action and 9,000 dead from disease.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clodfelter|first1=Micheal|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492\u20132015|date=2017|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=306|edition=4th}}</ref> Spanish colonial authorities encouraged Queen Isabella II to abandon the island, seeing the occupation as a nonsensical waste of troops and money. However, the rebels were in a state of political disarray, and proved unable to present a cohesive set of demands. The first president of the provisional government, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Salcedo|Pepillo Salcedo]] (allied with B\u00e1ez) was deposed by General [[:es:Gaspar Polanco|Gaspar Polanco]] in September 1864, who, in turn, was deposed by General Antonio Pimentel three months later. The rebels formalized their provisional rule by holding a national convention in February 1865, which enacted a new constitution, but the new government exerted little authority over the various regional guerrilla ''[[caudillo]]s'', who were largely independent of one another.\n\nUnable to extract concessions from the disorganized rebels, when the American Civil War ended, in March 1865, Queen Isabella annulled the annexation and independence was restored, with the last Spanish troops departing by July.<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+do0017)</ref> More than 7,000 Dominicans perished in battles and epidemics.<ref name=Routledge/> Relations between the Dominican Republic and Haiti were tense once the new Dominican government came to power since Haitian President [[Fabre Geffrard]] had refused to support the independence movement out of fear of Spanish reprisals.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Haiti|page=118}}</ref> Within three years after fighting ended in Santo Domingo, uprisings began in both remaining Spanish colonies. In both islands, Dominican veterans joined the independence fight. Within the decade, Spanish colonialism began to crumble, and rebels won emancipation.\n\n==Restoration: Second Republic 1865\u20131916==\n\n===Second Republic===\nBy the time the Spanish departed, most of the main towns lay in ruins and the island was divided among several dozen ''caudillos''. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cabral]] controlled most of [[Barahona Province|Barahona]] and the southwest with the support of B\u00e1ez's mahogany-exporting partners, while cattle rancher [[Ces\u00e1reo Guillermo]] assembled a coalition of former ''Santanista'' generals in the southeast, and [[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]] controlled the north coast. Once the Spanish were vanquished, the numerous military and guerrilla leaders began to fight among themselves. From the Spanish withdrawal to 1879, there were twenty-one changes of government and at least fifty military uprisings.<ref>[[Frank Moya Pons]], ''Dominican Republic: A National History'' Pg. 222 (Hispaniola Books: New Rochelle, N.Y., 1995)</ref>  Haiti served as a haven for Dominican political exiles and a base of operations for insurgents, often with the support of the Haitian government, during the frequent civil wars and revolutions of the period.\n\nIn the course of these conflicts, two parties emerged. The Partido Rojo (Literally \"Red Party\") represented the southern cattle ranching [[latifundia]] and mahogany-exporting interests, as well as the artisans and laborers of Santo Domingo, and was dominated by B\u00e1ez, who continued to seek annexation by a foreign power. The Partido Azul (literally \"Blue Party\"), led by Luper\u00f3n, represented the tobacco farmers and merchants of the Cibao and Puerto Plata and was nationalist and liberal in orientation. During these wars, the small and corrupt national army was far outnumbered by militias organized and maintained by local ''caudillos'' who set themselves up as provincial governors. These militias were filled out by poor farmers or landless plantation workers impressed into service who usually took up banditry when not fighting in revolution.\n\n[[File:President Baez with American Commissioners, 1871.jpg|thumb|left|Reception of American commissioners by President B\u00e1ez, 1871.]]Within a month of the nationalist victory, Cabral, whose troops were the first to enter Santo Domingo, ousted Pimentel, but a few weeks later General Guillermo led a rebellion in support of B\u00e1ez, forcing Cabral to resign and allowing B\u00e1ez to retake the presidency in October. B\u00e1ez was overthrown by the Cibao farmers under Luper\u00f3n, leader of the Partido Azul, the following spring, but Luper\u00f3n's allies turned on each other and Cabral reinstalled himself as president in a coup in 1867. After bringing several ''Azules'' (\"Blues\") into his cabinet the ''Rojos'' (\"Reds\") revolted, returning B\u00e1ez to power. In 1869, B\u00e1ez negotiated a [[The Annexation of Santo Domingo|treaty of annexation with the United States]].<ref>Ian Bell,''The Dominican Republic'' Pg. 59 (Westview Pres: Boulder, Co., 1981)</ref> Supported by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward, Sr.|William Seward]], who hoped to establish a [[United States Navy|Navy]] base at Saman\u00e1, in 1871 the treaty was defeated in the [[United States Senate]] through the efforts of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] Senator [[Charles Sumner]].<ref>*Dennis Hidalgo, ''Charles Sumner and the Annexation of the Dominican Republic,'' Itinerario (Volume XXI, 2/1997): 51. (Published by the Centre for the History of European Expansion of Leiden University, The Netherlands).</ref>\n\nIn 1874, the ''Rojo'' governor of Puerto Plata, [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez (politician)|Ignacio Maria Gonz\u00e1lez Sant\u00edn]], staged a coup in support of an ''Azul'' rebellion, but was deposed by the ''Azules'' two years later. In February 1876, [[Ulises Espaillat]], backed by Luper\u00f3n, was named President, but ten months later troops loyal to B\u00e1ez returned him to power. One year a new rebellion allowed Gonz\u00e1lez to seize power, only to be deposed by Ces\u00e1reo Guillermo in September 1878, who was in turn deposed by Luper\u00f3n in December 1879. Ruling the country from his hometown of Puerto Plata, enjoying an economic boom due to increased tobacco exports to [[Germany]], Luper\u00f3n enacted a new constitution setting a two-year presidential term limit and providing for direct elections, suspended the semi-formal system of bribes and initiated construction on the nation's first railroad, linking the town of [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] with the port of [[S\u00e1nchez, Dominican Republic|S\u00e1nchez]] on Saman\u00e1 Bay.\n\nThe [[Ten Years' War]] in [[Cuba]] brought Cuban sugar planters to the country in search of new lands and security from the insurrection that freed their slaves and destroyed their property. Most settled in the southeastern coastal plain, and, with assistance from Luper\u00f3n\u2019s government, built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. They were later joined by Italians, Germans, Puerto Ricans and Americans in forming the nucleus of the Dominican sugar bourgeoisie, marrying into prominent families to solidify their social position. Disruptions in global production caused by the Ten Years' War, the American Civil War and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] allowed the Dominican Republic to become a major sugar exporter. Over the following two decades, sugar surpassed tobacco as the leading export, with the former fishing hamlets of [[San Pedro de Macor\u00eds]] and [[La Romana, Dominican Republic|La Romana]] transformed into thriving ports. To meet their need for better transportation, over 300 miles of private rail-lines were built by and serving the sugar plantations by 1897.<ref>Emelio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'' Pg. 32 (Westview Press: Boulder, San Francisco, Oxford, 1995)</ref> An 1884 slump in prices led to a wage freeze, and a subsequent labor shortage was filled by migrant workers from the [[Leeward Islands]]\u2014the [[Virgin Islands]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Anguilla]], and [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] (referred to by Dominicans as ''[[cocolo]]''s).<ref>''cocolo'' is a corruption of the name of one of the principal islands of origin, [[Tortola]].

Others worked in coffee fields. [[Arabs]] began to arrive in the Dominican Republic during the latter part of the nineteenth century. They were widely accused of being dirty and of having bad manners and habits, and the government was reproached for having allowed these immigrants into the nation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Culture and Customs of the Dominican Republic|page=55}}</ref> Since upper-class Dominicans refused to give membership to wealthy Arabs to their private clubs like the exclusive Club de Uni\u00f3n, the Arabs created their own.<ref group=Note>Juan Elm\u00fadesi, a very wealthy man of Lebanese extraction, had to rely on Trujillo's influence to gain a membership into the Club de Uni\u00f3n in 1946.</ref>\n\n=== Ulises Heureaux and U.S. protectorate ===\nAllying with the emerging sugar interests, the dictatorship of General [[Ulises Heureaux]], who was popularly known as Lil\u00eds, brought unprecedented stability to the island through iron-fisted rule that lasted almost two decades. The son of a [[Haiti]]an father and a mother from [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas, Virgin Islands]], Lil\u00eds was distinguished by his blackness from most Dominican political leaders, with the exception of Luper\u00f3n. He served as President 1882\u20131883, 1887, and 1889\u20131899, wielding power through a series of puppet presidents when not occupying the office. Incorporating both ''[[Los Coludos|Rojos]]'' and ''[[Blue Party (Dominican Republic)|Azules]]'' into his government, he developed an extensive network of spies and informants to crush potential opposition. His government undertook a number of major infrastructure projects, including the electrification of Santo Domingo, the beginning of telephone and telegraph service, the construction of a bridge over the [[Ozama River]], and the completion of a single-track railroad linking Santiago and Puerto Plata, financed by the [[Amsterdam]]-based Westendorp Co.<ref>Teresita Mart\u00ednez-Vergne, ''Nation & Citizen in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 135</ref>\n\nLil\u00eds's dictatorship was dependent upon heavy borrowing from European and American banks to enrich himself, stabilize the existing debt, strengthen the bribe system, pay for the army, finance infrastructural development and help set up sugar mills. However, sugar prices underwent a steep decline in the last two decades of the 19th century. When the Westendorp Co. went bankrupt in 1893, he was forced to mortgage the nation's customs fees, the main source of government revenues, to a New York financial firm called the San Domingo Improvement Co.

In order to preempt military intervention, United States president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] introduced the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would assume responsibility for ensuring that the nations of Latin America met their financial obligations. In January 1905, under this corollary, the United States assumed administration of the Dominican Republic's customs. Under the terms of this agreement, a Receiver-General, appointed by the U.S. President, kept 55% of total revenues to pay off foreign claimants, while remitting 45% to the Dominican government.

However, his assassination in 1911, for which Morales and Arias were at least indirectly responsible, once again plunged the republic into chaos. For two months, executive power was held by a civilian junta dominated by the chief of the army, General Alfredo Victoria.

In 1913, V\u00e1squez returned from exile in Puerto Rico to lead a new rebellion.

The Dominican Congress rejected these demands and began impeachment proceedings against Jimenes. The United States occupied [[Haiti]] in July 1915, with the implicit threat that the Dominican Republic might be next. Jimenes's Minister of War [[Desiderio Arias]] staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in April 1916, providing a pretext for the United States to occupy the Dominican Republic.\n\n==United States occupation: 1916\u20131924==<!-- This section is linked from [[Calvin Coolidge]] -->\n{{main|United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)}}\n\n===Conventional campaign===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Pacification of the Dominican Republic\n|partof=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date=June 1916 \u2013 April 1917\n|place=[[Dominican Republic]]\n|result=U.S. victory\n|combatant1={{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Dominican Republic]]\n|combatant2={{flag|United States|1912}}\n|commander1={{flagicon|Dominican Republic}} [[Desiderio Arias]]\n|commander2={{flagicon|United States|1912}} [[William B.

They occupied Monte Cristi without meeting resistance, but at Puerto Plata they had to fight their way into the city under heavy but inaccurate fire from about 500 pro-Arias irregulars. During this landing the Marines sustained several casualties, including the death of Captain Herbert J. Hirshinger, the first Marine killed in combat in the Dominican campaign. Insurgent losses, while never accurately determined, were light.\n\nA column of Marines under Colonel Joseph H. Pendleton marched toward Santiago de los Caballeros, where rebel forces had established a government. Along the way, Dominicans tore up the railroad tracks, forcing Marines to walk. They also burned bridges, delaying the march.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Invaded: How Latin Americans and Their Allies Fought and Ended U.S. Occupations|page=41}}</ref> Twenty-four miles into the march, the Marines encountered Las Trencheras, two fortified ridges the Dominicans had long thought invulnerable: the Spanish had been defeated there in 1864. At 08:00 hours on June 27, Pendleton ordered his artillery to pound the ridgeline. Machine guns offered covering fire. A bayonet attack cleared the first ridge. Rifle fire removed the rebels who were threatening from atop the second.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Crumley|first1=B. L.|title=The Marine Corps: Three Centuries of Glory|date=2012|publisher=Amber Books Ltd}}</ref> The significance of this battle lies in the fact that this was the first experience of Marines advancing with the support of modern artillery and machine guns.\n\nA week later, the Marines encountered another entrenched rebel force at Guayacanas. The rebels kept up single-shot fire against the automatic weapons of the Marines before the Marines drove them off. The battle was important in the history of the 4th Marines insofar as the regiment subsequently acquired its first [[Medal of Honor]] recipient. First Sergeant [[Roswell Winans]], while manning his machine gun, displayed such exceptional valor that he was later awarded the nation's highest military honor. Sergeant Winans obtained his award for the bravado that he demonstrated when for a time he single-handedly raked enemy lines with his weapon. Then, when the gun jammed, he set about clearing it in full view of the Dominicans without regard to his personal safety. With his supporters defeated, Arias surrendered on July 5 in exchange for being pardoned.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McPherson|first1=Alan|title=A Short History of U.S. Interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\nAt San Francisco de Macor\u00eds, Governor Juan P\u00e9rez, a supporter of Arias, refused to recognize the U.S. military government.

[[Ernest Calvin Williams|Ernest C. Williams]], whose detachment was billeted in San Francisco, charged the closing gates of the fort at nightfall with a dozen Marines. Eight were shot down; the others, including Williams, forced their way in and seized the old structure. Another Marine detachment seized the police station. Reinforcements from nearby detachments soon suppressed the uprising.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars Volume II: The Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900\u20132001|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> The Marine Corps' subsequent efforts at \u201cstate-building,\u201d as it is commonly known today, received little assistance from Dominicans. Dominican elites, animated by nationalist resentment of the takeover of their country, refused to help the foreigners restructure their government and society.\n\n===Occupation===\n[[File:American Red Cross convoy, D.

The American military government implemented many of the institutional reforms carried out in the United States during the [[Progressive Era]], including reorganization of the tax system, accounting and administration, expansion of primary education, the creation of a nationwide police force to unify the country, and the construction of a national system of roads, including a highway linking Santiago to Santo Domingo.\n\nDespite the reforms, virtually all Dominicans resented the loss of their sovereignty to foreigners, few of whom spoke Spanish or displayed much real concern for the nation's welfare, and the military government, unable to win the backing of any prominent Dominican political leaders, imposed strict censorship laws and imprisoned critics of the occupation. In 1920, U.S. authorities enacted a Land Registration Act, which broke up the ''terrenos comuneros'' and dispossessed thousands of peasants who lacked formal titles to the lands they occupied, while legalizing false titles held by the sugar companies. In the southeast, dispossessed peasants formed armed bands, called ''gavilleros'', waging a guerrilla war that lasted six years, with most of the fighting in [[Hato Mayor Province|Hato Mayor]] and [[El Seibo]]. At any given time, the Marines faced eight to twelve such bands each composed of several hundred followers. The guerrillas benefited from a superior knowledge of the terrain and the support of the local population, and the Marines relied on increasingly brutal counterinsurgency methods. However, rivalries between various gavilleros often led them to fight against one another, and even cooperate with occupation authorities. In addition, cultural schisms between the ''campesinos'' (i.e. rural people, or peasants) and city dwellers prevented the guerrillas from cooperating with the urban middle-class nationalist movement.\n\nThe most notorious rebel of Seibo was a daring Dominican bandit with the nom de guerre of Vicentico Evangelista. In March 1917 he brutally executed two American civilians, engineers from an American-owned plantation, who were lashed to trees, savagely hacked with machetes, then left dangling for ravenous wild boars.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Banana Wars: United States Intervention in the Caribbean, 1898\u20131934|page=146}}</ref> He led Marine pursuers on a merry chase before surrendering on July 5 of that year. Two days later Vicentico was shot and killed by Marines \u201cwhile trying to escape.\u201d On August 13, 1918, a five-man Marine patrol was ambushed near Manchado; four Marines were killed and the survivor wounded. By 1919 the Marines had received radios that made it easier to coordinate their efforts and six Curtiss \u201cJenny\u201d biplanes that allowed them to expand the reach of their patrolling and even to bomb some guerrilla outposts. The unrest in the eastern provinces lasted until 1922 when the guerrillas finally agreed to surrender in return for amnesty. During the course of the campaign between 1916 and 1922, the Marines claim to have killed or wounded 1,137 \u201cbandits,\u201d while 20 Marines were killed and 67 wounded.<ref name=Boot>{{cite book|last1=Boot|first1=Max|title=The Savage Wars Of Peace: Small Wars And The Rise Of American Power|date=2014}}</ref> (Forty U.S. sailors died separately when a hurricane wrecked their [[USS Tennessee (ACR-10)|ship]] on Santo Domingo's rocky shore.)\n\nIn the San Juan valley, near the border with Ha\u00efti, followers of a [[Vodu]] faith healer named Liborio resisted the occupation and aided the Haitian ''cacos'' in their war against the Americans, until his death in 1922. When the Haitian and Dominican forces began to fight the U.S. interventions, they suffered immensely due to the superiority of U.S. training and technology. They were poorly armed and a \"minority of them carried old-model black-powder rifles; the majority went into battle with swords, machetes, and pikes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=Edward|title=Presence, Prevention, and Persuasion: A Historical Analysis of Military Force and Political Influence|date=2004|publisher=Lexington Books|page=163}}</ref> The obsolete weapons as well as the lack of training and institutional control over the regional armed forces ensured American military preeminence in the region.\n\n[[File:Haiti and Santo Domingo inset map (1921).jpg|thumb|left|350px|Map of the Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo) and Haiti in 1921]]\nIn what was referred to as ''la danza de los millones'', with the destruction of European sugar-beet farms during World War I, sugar prices rose to their highest level in history, from $5.50 in 1914 to $22.50 per pound in 1920. Dominican sugar exports increased from 122,642 tons in 1916 to 158,803 tons in 1920, earning a record $45.3 million.<ref>Bruce Calder, The Impact of Intervention, Pg. 93</ref> However, European beet sugar production quickly recovered, which, coupled with the growth of global sugar cane production, glutted the world market, causing prices to plummet to only $2.00 by the end of 1921. This crisis drove many of the local sugar planters into bankruptcy, allowing large U.S. conglomerates to dominate the sugar industry. By 1926, only twenty-one major estates remained, occupying an estimated {{convert|520,000|acre|km2}}. Of these, twelve U.S.-owned companies owned more than 81% of this total area.<ref>Bruce Calder, The Impact of Intervention, Pg. 93. The largest two corporations, the South Porto Rico Company and West Indies Sugar Corporation, owned 150,000 and 100,000 acres (600 and 400 km\u00b2) respectively.</ref> While the foreign planters who had built the sugar industry integrated into Dominican society, these corporations expatriated their profits to the United States. As prices declined, sugar estates increasingly relied on Haitian laborers. This was facilitated by the military government's introduction of regulated contract labor, the growth of sugar production in the southwest, near the Haitian border, and a series of strikes by ''[[cocolo]]'' cane cutters organized by the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].\n\n===Withdrawal===\n[[File:US Marines camp in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|Camp of US Marines in the Dominican Republic during the occupation.<br>[[Fortaleza San Luis]] (Santiago de los Caballeros)]]\nIn the 1920 United States presidential election [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Warren Harding]] criticized the occupation and promised eventual U.S. withdrawal. While Jimenes and V\u00e1squez sought concessions from the United States, the collapse of sugar prices discredited the military government and gave rise to a new nationalist political organization, the Dominican National Union, led by Dr. Henr\u00edquez from exile in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba, which demanded unconditional withdrawal. They formed alliances with frustrated nationalists in Puerto Rico and Cuba, as well as critics of the occupation in the United States itself, most notably ''[[The Nation]]'' and the Haiti-San Domingo Independence Society. In May 1922, a Dominican lawyer, Francisco Peynado, went to Washington, D.C. and negotiated what became known as the Hughes\u2013Peynado Plan. It stipulated immediate establishment of a provisional government pending elections, approval of all laws enacted by the U.S. military government, and the continuation of the 1907 treaty until all the Dominican Republic's foreign debts had been settled. On October 1, [[Juan Bautista Vicini]], the son of a wealthy Italian immigrant sugar planter, was named provisional president, and the process of U.S. withdrawal began. The principal legacy of the occupation was the creation of a National Police Force, used by the Marines to help fight against the various guerrillas, and later the main vehicle for the rise of [[Rafael Trujillo]].\n\nIn contrast to the much romanticized fighting of the Rough Riders at [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] in Cuba almost two decades earlier, the Marines' anti-rebel campaigns in the Dominican Republic were hot, often godlessly uncomfortable, and largely devoid of heroism and glory.<ref>{{cite book|title=America's Dirty Wars: Irregular Warfare from 1776 to the War on Terror|date=125}}</ref>\n\n==The rise and fall of Trujillo: Third Republic 1924\u201365==\n\n=== Horacio V\u00e1squez 1924\u201330===\nThe occupation ended in 1924, with a democratically elected government under president V\u00e1squez. The V\u00e1squez administration brought great social and economic prosperity to the country and respected political and civil rights. Rising export commodity prices and government borrowing allowed the funding of public works projects and the expansion and modernization of Santo Domingo.<ref name=LoC>{{cite web |title=The Era of Trujillo |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/11.htm |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough considered to be a relatively principled man, V\u00e1squez had risen amid many years of political infighting. In a move directed against his chief opponent Federico Velasquez, in 1927 V\u00e1squez agreed to have his term extended from four to six years. The change was approved by the Dominican Congress, but was of debatable legality; \"its enactment effectively invalidated the constitution of 1924 that V\u00e1squez had previously sworn to uphold.\"<ref name=LoC/> V\u00e1squez also removed the prohibition against presidential reelection, and postulated himself for another term in elections to be held in May 1930. However, his actions had by then led to doubts that the contest could be fair.<ref name=LoC/> Furthermore, these elections took place amid economic problems, as the [[Great Depression]] had dropped sugar prices to less than one dollar per pound.\n\nIn February, a revolution was proclaimed in Santiago by a lawyer named [[Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a]]. When the commander of the ''Guardia Nacional Dominicana'' (the new designation of the armed force created under the Occupation), [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]], ordered his troops to remain in their barracks, the sick and aging V\u00e1squez was forced into exile and Estrella proclaimed provisional president. In May, Trujillo was elected with 95% of the vote, having used the army to harass and intimidate electoral personnel and potential opponents. After his inauguration in August, at his request, the Dominican Congress proclaimed the beginning of the 'Era of Trujillo'.<ref name=LoC/>\n\n===The era of Trujillo 1931\u201361===\nTrujillo established absolute political control, while promoting economic development\u2014from which mainly he and his supporters benefitted\u2014and severe repression of domestic human rights.<ref>Johathan Hartlyn. ''The Trujillo Regime in the Dominican Republic''. In ''Sultanistic Regimes'', Johns Hopkins University Press</ref> Trujillo treated his political party, ''El Partido Dominicano'' (The Dominican Party), as a rubber-stamp for his decisions. The true source of his power was the ''Guardia Nacional''\u2014larger, better armed, and more centrally controlled than any military force in the nation's history. By disbanding the regional militias, the Marines eliminated the main source of potential opposition, giving the Guard \"a virtual monopoly on power\".<ref>Emelio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 96</ref> By 1940, Dominican military spending was 21% of the national budget.<ref>Emelio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 97</ref> At the same time, he developed an elaborate system of espionage agencies. By the late 1950s, there were at least seven categories of intelligence agencies, spying on each other as well as the public. All citizens were required to carry identification cards and good-conduct passes from the secret police. Obsessed with adulation, Trujillo promoted an extravagant cult of personality. When a hurricane struck Santo Domingo in 1930, killing over 3,000 people, he rebuilt the city and renamed it ''Ciudad Trujillo'': \"Trujillo City\"; he also renamed the country's and the Caribbean's highest mountain, [[Pico Duarte]] (Duarte Peak), ''Pico Trujillo''. Over 1,800 statues of Trujillo were built, and all public works projects were required to have a plaque with the inscription 'Era of Trujillo, Benefactor of the Fatherland'.<ref>Eric Paul Roorda, ''The Dictator Next Door: The Good Neighbor Policy and the Dominican Republic, 1930\u20131945.-</ref>\n\n[[File:Haitian corpses after the 1937 massacre.jpg|thumb|Haitian corpses after the 1937 massacre]]\nAs sugar estates turned to Haiti for seasonal migrant labor, increasing numbers settled in the Dominican Republic permanently.

A shocked American missionary, Father Barnes, wrote about the massacre in a letter to his sister. It never reached her. He was found on the floor of his home, murdered brutally.<ref name=Archer>{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Jules|title=The Dictators: Who They Are and How They Have Influenced Our World|date=2017|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.}}</ref> But the news leaked out, stirring a decision by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba to make a joint investigation. General [[Hugh S. Johnson|Hugh Johnson]], a former [[New Deal]] official, made a national broadcast describing how Haitian women had been stabbed and mutilated, babies bayoneted, and men tied up and thrown into the sea to drown.<ref name=Archer/>\nThe massacre was the result of a new policy which Trujillo called the 'Dominicanisation of the frontier'. Place names along the border were changed from [[Haitian Creole|Creole]] and French to Spanish, the practice of [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] was outlawed, quotas were imposed on the percentage of foreign workers that companies could hire, and a law was passed preventing Haitian workers from remaining after the sugar harvest. Another example of repression and prejudice came about a year after Trujillo's death, in December 28, 1962, when the mainly [[Haitians in the Dominican Republic|Dominico-Haitian]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Peasants and Religion: A Socioeconomic Study of Dios Olivorio and the Palma Sola Religion in the Dominican Republic|page=696}}</ref> peasant community of Palma Sola, which challenged the racial, political, and economic situation of the country, was bombarded with [[napalm]] by the Dominican Air Force.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Sean|last2=Hutton|first2=Tom|title=The Dominican Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3A7z6IBk62MC+|year=2002|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-912-0|page=286}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Trujillo sought to emulate [[Generalissimo]] [[Francisco Franco]], he welcomed [[Spanish Second Republic|Spanish Republican]] refugees following the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] in the Second World War, the Dominican Republic took in many Jews fleeing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] who had been refused entry by other countries. The Jews settled in Sosua.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Sosua|url=http://www.sosua-villas.com/history-of-sosua/|website=sosua-villas.com}}</ref> These decisions arose from a policy of ''blanquismo'', closely connected with anti-Haitian xenophobia, which sought to add more light-skinned individuals to the Dominican population by promoting immigration from Europe. As part of the [[Good Neighbor policy]], in 1940, the [[U.S. State Department]] signed a treaty with Trujillo relinquishing control over the nation's customs. When the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor]] Trujillo followed the United States in declaring war on the [[Axis powers]], even though he had openly professed admiration for Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]. During the [[Cold War]], he maintained close ties to the United States, declaring himself the world's 'Number One Anticommunist' and becoming the first Latin American President to sign a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the United States. One tactical asset of the United States in the Cold War was the missile tracking system established across the region, which comprised a series of individual stations in neighboring countries. One of these stations was located in the Dominican Republic, requiring bilateral negotiations to establish the facility, and cooperation to operate it. The ranks of the U.S. military mission in the Dominican Republic swelled, as aircraft trainers and mechanics joined the attach\u00e9s of the four service branches and their staffs working at the U.S. embassy. The missile tracking station and the military mission were the strongest Cold War ties between the United States and the Dominican Republic, but they became liabilities as the relationship soured.\n\nSoon after the end of World War II, Trujillo constructed an arms factory at San Crist\u00f3bal. It made hand grenades, gunpowder, dynamite, revolvers, automatic rifles, carbines, submachine guns, light machine guns, antitank guns, and munitions. In addition, some quantities of mortars and aerial bombs were produced and light artillery rebuilt.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism|page=105}}</ref> Trujillo's increasingly powerful military withstood a series of invasion attempts by leftist Dominican exiles. On June 19, 1949, an airplane carrying Dominican rebels from Guatemala was intercepted and destroyed by the Dominican coastguard at Luper\u00f3n on the north coast. Ten years later, on June 14, 1959, Dominican revolutionaries launched three simultaneous attacks. At Estero Hondo and Maim\u00f3n on the north coast, the rebels followed the Castro tactic of landing from ships, but the Dominican government's air power and artillery overwhelmed the attackers as they landed. At Constanza in the high mountains near the border with Haiti, a small band of armed exiles came by air. On that occasion, the heavy bombers of the Dominican Air Force came into action but were inaccurate, hitting more civilians than guerrillas. It was Dominican peasants who tracked down and captured or killed most of the fugitives, for which they received cash bounties from Trujillo's government.\n\nTrujillo and his family established a near-monopoly over the national economy. By the time of his death, he had accumulated a fortune of around $800 million; he and his family owned 50\u201360 percent of the arable land, some {{convert|700,000|acre|km2}}, and Trujillo-owned businesses accounted for 80% of the commercial activity in the capital.<ref>Howard Wiarda ''The Dominican Republic: A Nation in Transition'', Pg. 40\u201341</ref> He exploited nationalist sentiment to purchase most of the nation's sugar plantations and refineries from U.S. corporations; operated monopolies on salt, rice, milk, cement, tobacco, coffee, and insurance; owned two large banks, several hotels, port facilities, an airline and shipping line; deducted 10% of all public employees' salaries (ostensibly for his party); and received a portion of prostitution revenues.<ref>Jared Diamond, Collapse, 'One Island, Two Peoples, Two Histories' (Penguin Books: New York and London, 2005) Pg. 337</ref> World War II brought increased demand for Dominican exports, and the 1940s and early 1950s witnessed economic growth and considerable expansion of the national infrastructure. During this period, the capital city was transformed from merely an administrative center to the national center of shipping and industry, although 'it was hardly coincidental that new roads often led to Trujillo's plantations and factories, and new harbors benefited Trujillo's shipping and export enterprises.'<ref>Jan Knippers Black, ''The Dominican Republic: politics and development in an unsovereign state.</ref>\n\nMismanagement and corruption resulted in major economic problems. By the end of the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision to make a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered [[Jes\u00fas Gal\u00edndez|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda de Gal\u00edndez]], a [[Basque people|Basque]] exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In June 1960, Dominican [[Servicio de Inteligencia Militar|secret police agents]] in Caracas used a car bomb in a nearly successful attempt to kill President [[R\u00f3mulo Betancourt]] of [[Venezuela]], who had become the leading voice in the anti-Trujillo chorus, burning him badly. Tracing the attack to Trujillo, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) imposed sanctions for the first time since its creation in 1946, cutting off shipments of oil, among other things, to the Dominican Republic. Refusing to back down, Trujillo lashed out at Catholic priests who read a pastoral letter from the pulpit asking for merciful treatment of political opponents. One of his last-ditch threats was to ally with the Soviet Union, as he had implied was an option in the past.\n\nA group of Dominican dissidents killed Trujillo in a car chase on the way to his country villa near [[San Crist\u00f3bal, Dominican Republic|San Crist\u00f3bal]] on May 30, 1961. The sanctions remained in force after Trujillo's assassination. His son [[Ramfis Trujillo|Ramfis]] took over the presidency and rounded up all the conspirators. They were summarily executed, some of them being fed to sharks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Crassweller|title=Trujillo: The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator|page=44}}</ref> In November 1961, the military plot of the [[:es:Rebeli\u00f3n de los Pilotos|Rebellion of the Pilots]] forced the Trujillo family into exile, fleeing to France, and the heretofore puppet-president [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] assumed effective power.\n\n===The post-Trujillo instability 1961\u201365===\nAt the insistence of the United States, Balaguer was forced to share power with a seven-member Council of State, established on January 1, 1962, and including moderate members of the opposition. OAS sanctions were lifted January 4, and, after an attempted coup, Balaguer resigned and went into exile on January 16. The reorganized Council of State, under President [[Rafael Filiberto Bonnelly]] headed the Dominican government until elections could be held. These elections, in December 1962, were won by [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], a scholar and poet who had founded the opposition ''Partido Revolucionario Dominicano'' ([[Dominican Revolutionary Party]], or PRD) in exile, during the Trujillo years. His leftist policies, including land redistribution, nationalization of certain foreign holdings, and attempts to bring the military under civilian control, antagonized the military officer corps, the Catholic hierarchy, and the upper-class, who feared 'another Cuba'.\n\nThe Presidency of Juan Bosch in 1963 led to one of the tensest periods in contemporary [[Dominican Republic\u2013Haiti relations|Haitian-Dominican relations]]. Bosch supported the efforts of Haitian exiles who trained to overthrow [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]], Haiti's repressive president. In April 1963, former Haitian army officers reportedly tried to kill Duvalier's children, and many of those accused took refuge in the embassies of Latin American countries in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital. When Haitian police raided the Dominican embassy and held captive 22 refugees, the Dominican Republic broke off diplomatic relations and threatened to invade Haiti. The OAS mediated the dispute and eased the tension; Dominican troops, ready to invade, pulled back from the border; and many of the refugees were granted safe conduct out of Haiti. Hostilities erupted again in September that year when both sides shelled each other across the border. The OAS again intervened to make peace.\n\nIn September 1963 Bosch was overthrown by a right-wing military coup led by Colonel [[El\u00edas Wessin]] and was replaced by a three-man [[military junta]]. Bosch went into exile to Puerto Rico.  Afterwards a supposedly civilian triumvirate established a de facto dictatorship.\n\n==Dominican Civil War & Second United States occupation 1965\u201366==\n{{main|Dominican Civil War of 1965}}\nOn April 16, 1965, growing dissatisfaction generated another military rebellion on April 24, 1965 that demanded Bosch's restoration. The insurgents, reformist officers and civilian combatants loyal to Bosch commanded by Colonel [[Francisco Caama\u00f1o]], and who called themselves the Constitutionalists, staged a coup, seizing the national palace. Immediately, conservative military forces, led by Wessin and calling themselves Loyalists, struck back with tank assaults and aerial bombings against Santo Domingo. A few days of upheaval saw heavy fighting in the streets of the city and a pitched battle fought on the main bridge across the Ozama River, where civilians used guns supplied by their military allies to repulse the tank corps loyal to the military government, preventing it from entering the capital.\n\nOn April 28, these anti-Bosch army elements requested U.S. military intervention and U.S. forces landed, ostensibly to protect U.S. citizens and to evacuate U.S. and other foreign nationals. U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], convinced of the defeat of the Loyalist forces and fearing the creation of \"a second Cuba\"<ref>Stephen G. Rabe, \"The Johnson Doctrine\", ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 36</ref> on America's doorstep, ordered U.S. forces to restore order. In what was initially known as [[Operation Power Pack]], 27,677 U.S. troops were ultimately ordered to the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two More Marines Killed in Dominica Two Newsmen Wounded by Red Gunfire|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DS19650506.2.12|work=Desert Sun|date=May 6, 1965}}</ref> The [[4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade|4th Marine Expeditionary Force]] and the army's [[82nd Airborne Division]] spearheaded the occupation. [[Psychological warfare|Psychological Warfare]] and Special Forces units also took part in the action.\n\nDenied a military victory, the Constitutionalist rebels quickly had a Constitutionalist congress elect Caama\u00f1o president of the country. U.S. officials countered by backing General [[Antonio Imbert]]. On May 7, Imbert was sworn in as president of the Government of National Reconstruction. The next step in the stabilization process, as envisioned by Washington and the OAS, was to arrange an agreement between President Caama\u00f1o and President Imbert to form a provisional government committed to early elections. However, Caama\u00f1o refused to meet with Imbert until several of the Loyalist officers, including Wessin y Wessin, were made to leave the country. On 13 May General Imbert launched an eight-day offensive to eliminate rebel resistance north of the line of communications. During the attack, U.S. troops shot down one of the new government's five [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustangs]] when it accidentally strafed their position. Imbert\u2019s forces took the northern part of the capital, destroying many buildings and killing many black civilians.<ref group=Note>The 1993 census shows that 82.05 percent of Dominicans are mulatto, 7.55 percent are white, and 4.13 percent are black.</ref> The United Nations dispatched a human rights team to investigate alleged atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dominican Atrocities Uncovered|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=MT19650813.2.90|work=Madera Tribune|date=August 13, 1965}}</ref>\n[[File:Corridor of Santo Dominguo.gif|thumb|left|Safety corridor]]\nBy May 14 the Americans had established a \"safety corridor\" connecting the [[San Isidro Air Base]] and the \"Duarte\" Bridge to the Embajador Hotel and United States Embassy in the center of Santo Domingo, essentially sealing off the Constitutionalist area of Santo Domingo. Road blocks were established and patrols ran continuously. Some 6,500 people from many nations were evacuated to safety. In addition, the US forces airlifted in relief supplies for Dominican nationals.\n\nBy mid-May, a majority of the OAS voted for Operation \u201cPush Ahead\u201d, the reduction of United States forces and their replacement by an [[Inter-American Peace Force]] (IAPF). The Inter-American Peace Force was formally established on May 23. The following troops were sent by each country: Brazil \u2013 1,130, [[Honduras]] \u2013 250, [[Paraguay]] \u2013 184, [[Nicaragua]] \u2013 160, [[Costa Rica]] \u2013 21 military police, and [[El Salvador]] \u2013 3 staff officers. The first contingent to arrive was a rifle company from Honduras which was soon backed by detachments from Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Brazil provided the largest unit, a reinforced infantry battalion. Brazilian General Hugo Panasco Alvim assumed command of the OAS ground forces, and on 26 May the U.S. forces began to withdraw.\n\nOn 15 June the rebels launched their final attempt to escape their Ciudad Nuevo stronghold. Camaa\u00f1o hurled all his best remaining units and weapons against the American lines, and soon mortar rounds were hitting the 82nd Airborne Division.<ref name=McFarland>{{cite book|last1=De La Pedraja|first1=Ren\u00e9|title=Wars of Latin America, 1948\u20131982: The Rise of the Guerrillas|date=2013-04-15|publisher=McFarland|page=155}}</ref> Although their heaviest weapons were recoilless cannons, the 82nd Airborne soundly defeated the rebels.<ref name=McFarland/> The fighting cost the U.S. five killed and thirty-one wounded, three of whom later died. The Brazilians, who had orders to remain on the defensive, suffered five wounded.\n\nThe mauling the Constitutionalists received on the 15th made them more amenable, but not yet committed, to a negotiated settlement. The fighting continued until August 31, 1965 when a truce was declared. Most American troops left shortly afterwards as policing and peacekeeping operations were turned over to Brazilian troops, but some U.S. military presence remained until September 1966. A total of 44 American soldiers died, 27 in action. 172 were wounded in action, as were six Brazilians and five Paraguayans. An estimated 6,000 to 10,000 Dominicans died,<ref name=\"leather\">[http://www.leatherneck.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15762 The US Intervention in the Dominican Republic, 1965<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> many of them civilians killed when the Dominican Air Force bombed their crowded Santo Domingo neighborhoods prior to the U.S. invasion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War|date=2013|page=267}}</ref>\n\n==Fourth Republic 1966\u2013Present==\n=== Balaguer's second Presidency 1966\u201378 ===\nIn June 1966, [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]], leader of the Reformist Party (which later became the [[Social Christian Reformist Party]] (PRSC), was elected and then re-elected to office in May 1970 and May 1974, both times after the major opposition parties withdrew late in the campaign because of the high degree of violence by pro-government groups. On November 28, 1966 a constitution was created, signed, and put into effect. The constitution stated that the president was elected to a four-year term. If there was a close election there would be a second round of voting to decide the winner. The voting age was eighteen, but married people under eighteen could also vote.\n\nRemnants of the constitutionalist movement and some scattered groups of the Dominican left started to plan for a revolution and in February 1973 Caama\u00f1o suddenly landed on a desolate beach in the southwest. Together with a small group of just ten men he made it for the mountains which they intended to make into a center for a campaign against the government of Balaguer. They were soon traced and hunted down by a party of 2,000 men, while 1,400 political, student and labor leaders were arrested all over the country. After two weeks Caama\u00f1o and his men were ambushed between Constanza and San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa and there the wounded and captured Francisco Alberto Caama\u00f1o De\u00f1\u00f3 was shot in the head by his captors.\n\nBalaguer led the Dominican Republic through a thorough economic restructuring, based on opening the country to foreign investment while protecting state-owned industries and certain private interests. This distorted, dependent development model produced uneven results. For most of Balaguer's first nine years in office the country experienced high growth rates (e.g., an average [[GDP]] growth rate of 9.4 percent between 1970 and 1975), to the extent that people talked about the \"Dominican miracle\". Foreign, mostly U.S. investment, as well as foreign aid, flowed into the country. Sugar, then the country's main export product, enjoyed good prices in the international market, and tourism grew tremendously.\n\nHowever, this excellent macroeconomic performance was not accompanied by an equitable distribution of wealth. While a group of new millionaires flourished during Balaguer's administrations, the poor simply became poorer. Moreover, the poor were commonly the target of state repression, and their socioeconomic claims were labeled 'communist' and dealt with accordingly by the state security apparatus.<ref>Roberto Cassa, ''Los doce a\u00f1os: Contrarevoluci\u00f3n y desarrollismo'', 2nd ed. Santo Domingo: Editora Buho 1991</ref> In the May 1978 election, Balaguer was defeated in his bid for a fourth successive term by [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez]] of the PRD. Balaguer then ordered troops to storm the election centre and destroy ballot boxes, declaring himself the victor. U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] refused to recognize Balaguer's claim, and, faced with the loss of foreign aid, Balaguer stepped down.\n\n===Guzm\u00e1n / Blanco interregnum 1978\u201386===\nGuzm\u00e1n's inauguration on August 16 marked the country's first peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to another. By the late 1970s, economic expansion slowed considerably as sugar prices declined and oil prices rose. Rising inflation and unemployment diminished support for the government and helped trigger a wave of mass emigration from the Dominican Republic to New York, coming on the heels of the similar migration of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] in the preceding decades.\n\nElections were again held in 1982. [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]] of the Dominican Revolutionary Party defeated Bosch and a resurgent Balaguer.\n\n===Balaguer's third Presidency 1986\u201396===\nBalaguer completed his return to power in 1986 when he won the Presidency again and remained in office for the next ten years. Elections in 1990 were marked by violence and suspected electoral fraud. The 1994 election too saw widespread pre-election violence, often aimed at intimidating members of the opposition. Balaguer won in 1994 but most observers felt the election had been stolen. Under pressure from the United States, Balaguer agreed to hold new elections in 1996. He himself would not run.\n\n===Since 1996===\n\n===Fern\u00e1ndez: First administration 1996\u20132000===\nIn 1996, U.S.-raised [[Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez Reyna]]  of Bosch's ''[[Dominican Liberation Party|Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana]]'' (Dominican Liberation Party) secured more than 51% of the vote, through an alliance with Balaguer. The first item on the president's agenda was the partial sale of some state-owned enterprises. Fern\u00e1ndez was praised for ending decades of isolationism and improving ties with other Caribbean countries, but he was criticized for not fighting corruption or alleviating the poverty that affected 60% of the population.\n\n===Mej\u00eda's administration 2000\u201304===\nIn May 2000 the center-left [[Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda]] of the PRD was elected president amid popular discontent over power outages in the recently privatized electric industry. His presidency saw major inflation and instability of the peso in 2003 because of the bankruptcy of three major commercial banks in the country due to the bad policies of the principal managers. During his remaining time as president he took action to save most savers of the closed banks, avoiding a major crisis. The relatively stable currency fell from about 16 [[Dominican peso]]s to 1 [[United States dollar]] to about 60 DOP to 1 USD, and was in the 40s to the dollar when he left office in August 2004. In the May 2004 presidential elections he was defeated by former president [[Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez]].\n\n===Fern\u00e1ndez: Second administration 2004\u201312===\nFern\u00e1ndez instituted austerity measures to deflate the peso and rescue the country from its economic crisis, and in the first half of 2006, the economy grew 11.7%. The peso is currently at the exchange rate of ~39 DOP to 1 USD.\n\nOver the last three decades, [[remittances]] (''remesas'') from Dominicans living abroad, mainly in the United States, have become increasingly important to the economy. From 1990 to 2000, the Dominican population of the U.S. doubled in size, from 520,121 in 1990 to 1,041,910, two-thirds of whom were born in the Dominican Republic\nitself. More than half of all [[Dominican Americans]] live in New York City, with the largest concentration in the neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in northern [[Manhattan]]. Over the past decade, the Dominican Republic has become the largest source of immigration to New York City, and today the [[New York metropolitan area|metropolitan area of New York]] has a larger Dominican population than any city except Santo Domingo.<ref>''The Newest New Yorkers: Immigrant New York in the New Millennium'' (New York City Department of City Planning, Population Division, 2004) Pg. 9</ref> Dominican communities have also developed in [[New Jersey]] (particularly [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]), [[Miami]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. In addition, tens of thousands of Dominicans and their descendants live in Puerto Rico. Many Dominicans arrive in Puerto Rico illegally by sea across the [[Mona Passage]], some staying and some moving on to the mainland U.S. (See [[Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico]].) Dominicans living abroad sent an estimated $3 billion in remittances to relatives at home, in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dominican-republic-the-businesspleasure-tango/article1652140.ece|title=Dominican Republic: The business-pleasure tango|date=12 March 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> In 1997, a new law took effect, allowing Dominicans living abroad to retain their citizenship and vote in presidential elections.

Conditions are ameliorated in many areas by elevation and by the northeast [[trade winds]], which blow steadily from the [[Atlantic]] all year long. The annual mean [[temperature]] is {{convert|25|\u00b0C}}; regional mean temperatures range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C|1}} in the heart of the Cordillera Central ([[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]]) to as high as {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in arid regions. Temperatures rarely rise above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}}, and freezing temperatures only occur in winter in the highest mountains. The average temperature in [[Santo Domingo]] in January is {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}}, and {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in July.\n\nThe rain season for the northern coast is from November to January. For the rest of the country, the rain season is from May to November. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1346|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with extremes of {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in the mountainous northeast (the windward side of the island) and {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the southwestern valleys. The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation, due to the [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the central and northern mountain ranges. The northwestern and southeastern extremes of the country are also arid.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is occasionally damaged by tropical storms and hurricanes, which originate in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean from June until November (mainly from August to October) each year.\n\n== Islands ==\nThere are several smaller islands and cays that are part of the Dominican territory. The largest islands are:\n#''[[Saona Island|Saona]]'', close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 117&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"santiago\" /> Its [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] name was ''Iai'' <ref name=\"Morales\">As shown in a map made by Andr\u00e9s Morales in 1508 and published in 1516.

[[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] named this island as Savona after the Italian city of the same name but the use during years has eliminated the letter ''v''.\n#''[[Beata Island|Beata]]'', in the southern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 27&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"santiago\" /> Its [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] name is unknown. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] named this island as ''Madama Beata''.\n#''[[Catalina Island, Dominican Republic|Catalina]]'', very close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 9.6&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"santiago\" /> Its [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] name was ''Iabanea''<ref name=\"Morales\" /> but some writers, including poets, say that it was called ''Toeya'' or ''Toella''. It was discovered by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] who named it ''Santa Catalina''.\n\n== Relief ==\n[[File:Cordillera Central, RD.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cordillera Central]]\nThe Dominican Republic is a country with many [[mountain]]s, and the highest peaks of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] are found here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by [[valley]]s with the same general direction.\n\nFrom north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Butterlin\n  | first = Jacques\n  | title = G\u00e9ologie Structural de la R\u00e9gion des Cara\u00efbes\n  | publisher = Masson\n  | year = 1977\n  | location = Paris\n  | pages = 110\u2013111\n  | language = French\n  | isbn = 2-225-44979-1 }}\n</ref>\n* ''Cordillera Septentrional'' (in English, \"Northern Range\"). It runs parallel to the north coast, with extensions to the northwest, the [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] Island, and to the southeast, the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula (with its ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''). Its highest mountain is [[Diego de Ocampo]], close to Santiago, with 1,249 m. There are several small plains between this range and the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers are short and most of them flow to the north.\n* The ''[[Cibao]]'' Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest and the most important valley of the country. This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'', to Saman\u00e1 Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the ''Yaque del Norte Valley'' (or ''L\u00ednea Noroeste'') and the eastern ''Yuna Valley'' (or ''Vega Real'', English: ''Royal Valley''). The ''Vega Real'' is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.\n* The ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (also called ''Sierra del Cibao'') is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the ''Massif du Nord'' (\"Northern Massif\").  The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: [[Pico Duarte]], 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called ''Sierra de Ocoa'', finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', is separated from the main chain by a [[Karst topography|karst]]ic region (''Los Haitises'') and with a west-east direction; it is located south of Saman\u00e1 Bay.\n* The ''San Juan Valley'' and ''[[Plain]] of Azua'' are big valleys south of the ''Cordillera Central'' with altitude from 0 to 600 m.\n* The ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'' (''Loma Bus\u00fa'', 1,350 m).\n* The ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' or ''Neiba Valley'' is a remarkable valley, with a west-east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the ''[[Enriquillo Lake]]''.\n* The ''Sierra de Bahoruco'', called ''Massif de la Selle'' in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.\n* ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English, \"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large [[prairie]] east of [[Santo Domingo]].\n\n[[File:Beach Barahona 2001.jpg|thumb|center|400px|A beach in the Barahona province]]\n\n== Rivers and lakes ==\nThe 8 longest rivers of the Dominican Republic are:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = De la Fuente\n  | first = Santiago\n  | title = Geograf\u00eda Dominicana\n  | publisher = Editora Colegial Quisqueyana\n  | year = 1976\n  | location = Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n  | pages = 110\u2013114 }}</ref>\n# ''[[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]]''.

Its watershed has an area of 2,005&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n# ''Mao''. It is 105&nbsp;km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the north into the Yaque del Norte River. Its watershed has an area of 864&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nThe [[Artibonite River]] is the longest river of the island but only 68&nbsp;km are in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], is the ''[[Lake Enriquillo]]''. It is located in the ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' with an area of 265&nbsp;km\u00b2. There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a [[saline lake]] with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.\n\nOthers lakes are ''Rinc\u00f3n'' ([[fresh water]], area of 28.2&nbsp;km\u00b2), ''Oviedo'' ([[brackish]] water, area of 28&nbsp;km\u00b2), ''Redonda'', ''Lim\u00f3n''.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Geography of North America}}\n{{North America topic|Climate of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of The Dominican Republic}}\n[[Category:Geography of the Dominican Republic| ]]", "sha1": "hzlnit0q3pptoyzsj2evo7kmijpjwmg"}}, {"title": "Demographics of the Dominican Republic", "ns": "0", "id": "8065", "revision": {"id": "860252738", "parentid": "860252657", "timestamp": "2018-09-19T11:45:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Afus199620", "id": "30645640"}, "comment": "/* Structure of the population http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref>{{cite web|title=Censos de Poblaci\u00f3n y Vivienda|url=http://www.one.gob.do/Estadisticas/263/poblacion-y-vivienda|website=Oficina Nacional de Estad\u00edstica|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n|1920 | 894665\n|1935 | 1479417\n|1950 | 2135872\n|1960 | 3047070\n|1970 | 4009458\n|1981 | 5545741\n|1993 | 7293390\n|2002 | 8562541\n|2010 | 9445281\n|2017 | 10169172\n}}\nThis article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Dominican Rep demography.png|thumb|450px|The Dominican Republic's population (1961\u20132003).]]\n\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Dominican Republic}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to 2,380,000 in 1950.

Tourism accounts for more than $1 billion in annual earnings. [[Free trade zone]] earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. According to a 1999 [[International Monetary Fund]] report, [[remittance]]s from [[Dominican American]]s, are estimated to be about $1.5 billion per year. Most of these funds are used to cover basic household needs such as shelter, food, clothing, health care and education. Secondarily, remittances have financed small businesses and other productive activities.<ref>Meyers, Deborah Waller. ''Migrant Remittances to Latin America; Reviewing the Literature'', Washington DC; Inter-American Dialogue 1998</ref>\n\nThe Dominican Republic\u2019s most important trading partner is the [[United States]] (about 40% of total commercial exchange). Other major trade partners are [[China]], [[Haiti]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]], in that quantitative order.<ref>{{cite web|title=OEC: Dominican Republic (DOM) Profile of Exports, Imports and Trade Partners|url=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/dom/|publisher=Observatory of Economic Complexity|accessdate=17 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170917044041/http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/dom/|archivedate=17 September 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The country exports free-trade-zone manufactured products (garments, [[medical device]]s, and so on), [[gold]], [[nickel]], protection equipment, [[banana]]s, [[liquor]], [[cocoa bean]]s, [[silver]], and [[sauces]] and [[seasonings]]. It imports petroleum, industrial raw materials, capital goods, and foodstuffs. On 5 September 2005, the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic]] ratified a [[free trade agreement]] with the U.S. and five Central American countries, the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA-DR). CAFTA-DR [[Entry into force|entered into force]] for the Dominican Republic on 1 March 2007. The total stock of U.S. [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in Dominican Republic as of 2006 was U.S. $3.3 billion, much of it directed to the energy and tourism sectors, to free trade zones, and to the telecommunications sector. Remittances were close to $2.7 billion in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAn important aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry (FTZ), which made up U.S. $4.55 billion in Dominican exports for 2006 (70% of total exports). Reports show, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007 and suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector experienced an approximate 17% drop in exports due in part to the appreciation of the Dominican peso against the dollar, Asian competition following expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a government-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005 but was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by firms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which somewhat offset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected that entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement will promote substantial growth in the FTZ sector for 2007.\n\nAn ongoing concern in the Dominican Republic is the inability of participants in the electricity sector to establish financial viability for the system. Three regional electricity distribution systems were privatized in 1998 via sale of 50% of shares to foreign operators; the Mej\u00eda administration repurchased all foreign-owned shares in two of these systems in late 2003. The third, serving the eastern provinces, is operated by U.S. concerns and is 50% U.S.-owned. The World Bank records that electricity distribution losses for 2005 totaled about 38.2%, a rate of losses exceeded in only three other countries. Industry experts estimate distribution losses for 2006 will surpass 40%, primarily due to low collection rates, theft, infrastructure problems and corruption. At the close of 2006, the government had exceeded its budget for electricity subsidies, spending close to U.S. $650 million. The government plans to continue providing subsidies. Congress passed a law in 2007 that criminalizes the act of stealing electricity, but it has not yet been fully implemented. The electricity sector is a highly politicized sector and the prospect of further effective reforms of the electricity sector is poor. Debts in the sector, including government debt, amount to more than U.S. $500 million. Some generating companies are under capitalized and at times unable to purchase adequate fuel supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35639.htm|title=Dominican Republic|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldocs.com/do/economy.htm|title=World Atlas - About Dominican Republic|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Primary Industries==\n\n===Agriculture===\nWith almost 80% of the total land area suitable for crop production and about 17% of the labor force engaged in farming, agriculture remains the primary occupation, accounting for 11% of GDP in 2001. Value of agricultural output grew at an average annual rate of 7.1% during 1968\u201373, but since 1975 the sector has been hampered by droughts (1975, 1977, and 1979), hurricanes (in 1979 and 1980), and slumping world prices and quota allocations for sugar (since 1985). In 1999, agricultural production was 0.4% higher than during 1989\u201391. The fertile Cibao Valley is the main agricultural center. In 1998, arable land totaled {{convert|1020000|ha|acre|abbr=off}}; with land under permanent crops at {{convert|480000|ha|acre|abbr=off}}.\n\nAfter Cuba, the Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean producer of sugarcane, the nation's most important crop. The State Sugar Council operates 12 sugar mills and accounts for about half of total production. Other large producers are the privately owned Vicini, with three mills, and Central Romana Corporation, whose mill is the largest in the country. Sugar is grown in the southeastern plains, around Barahona & on the North Coast Plain. In 1999, sugar production was 4.4 million tons, down from an average of 7.1 million tons during 1989\u20131991. Output of sugar has declined annually since 1982, and land is gradually being taken out of sugar production and switched to food crops. Production of raw sugar rose from 636,000 tons in 1990 to 813,000 tons in 1997 but fell to 374,000 tons in 1999.\n\nPart of the crop was destroyed by hurricanes in 1979 and 1980, and 1979\u201380 production was only 670,000 bags (40,200 tons). Although production was usually about 57,000\u201359,000 tons annually in the 1980s, the acreage harvested declined from {{convert|157000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} in the early 1980s to {{convert|139000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} in 1999, indicating a greater yield per acre. Coffee production in 1999 was estimated at 35,000 tons; exports of coffee in 2001 generated $11 million. Cocoa and tobacco are also grown for export. Dominican Republic is one of the top 10 major producer and exporter of cocoa in the world. Cocoa is also grown in the Cibao Valley around San Francisco de Macoris. Tobacco is also grown in the Cibao Valley, but around Santiago. In 1999, production of cocoa beans was 26,000 tons and of tobacco, 35,000 tons. Rice is grown around Monte Cristi & San Francisco de Macoris. Banana production in 1999 was 432,000 tons. Production of other crops in 1999 (in thousands of tons) included rice, 563; coconuts, 184; cassava, 127; tomatoes, 281; pulses, 69; dry beans, 26; eggplants, 7; and peanuts, 2.\n\n===Animal husbandry===\nIn 2001, Dominican livestock included 187,000 goats and 106,000 sheep. There were also about 2.1 million head of cattle, 60% for beef and 40% for dairy. The hog population was decimated by African swine fever, decreasing from 400,000 in 1978 to 20,000 in 1979; by 2001, however, it was 565,000. Poultry is the main meat source because it is cheaper than beef or pork. Poultry production relies on imports of feed grain from the United States. In 2001, 203,000 tons of poultry meat were produced, along with 71,000 tons of beef and 420,000 tons of milk.\n\n===Fishing===\nAlthough the waters surrounding the Dominican Republic abound with fish, the fishing industry is comparatively undeveloped, and fish for local consumption are imported. In 1837, the total marine catch was 5 ounces, down from 1 pound in 1798 . [[Marlin]], [[barracuda]], kingfish, [[mackerel]], [[tuna]], sailfish, and tarpon are found in the Monte Cristi Bank and Saman\u00e1 Bay, which also supports [[bonito]], [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], and American [[grouper]]. The inland catch amounted to 187 tons in 2000.\n\n===Forestry===\nAbout 28.4% of the total land area consisted of forests and woodlands in 2000. Roundwood production in 2000 totaled 562,000 cu m (19.8 million cu ft). Virtually all the timber cut is for land clearing and fuel.\n\n===Mining===\nMineral production has stagnated since a slump began in the mid-1980s. In 2000, mining accounted for 2% of GDP, which grew by 7.8%. Mining increased by 9.2%, stimulated by higher output and a higher average price of nickel, the country's most important mineral. Ferronickel was the country's leading export commodity and third-leading industry. Nickel is mined at Bonao. In 2000, nickel production was 39,943 tons, ranking tenth in the world, a decrease from 49,152 in 1997.\n\nProduction of gold and silver was suspended in 1999, including at what was, in 1980, the Western Hemisphere's largest gold mine, at [[Pueblo Viejo mine|Pueblo Viejo]]. Production was declining by the mid-1980s, so mining of the sulfide zone of the gold ore body was commenced, requiring more extensive processing facilities than had previously existed. Production of gold was 7,651&nbsp;kg in 1987 and 3,659 in 1996, and of silver, 39,595&nbsp;kg in 1988 and 17,017&nbsp;kg in 1996. Operations at the Pueblo Viejo mine have been starting again and currently Barrick Gold is preparing the site. The use of a foreign company for the extraction of gold at the largest mine in the Western Hemisphere has startled and concerned many Dominicans who believe that this gold is Dominican gold and should be extracted by Dominican companies and not foreign. Some groups began to protest against the Barrick Gold in 2009 and 2010.\n\nProduction of bauxite, traditionally the principal mining product, ceased in 1992. The Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) mined bauxite between 1959 and 1983, when it turned its concession over to the state. Production in 1991 dropped 92% from the previous year, as a presidential decree suspended mining operations at the largest mine, in response to increasing fears of deforestation, although reforestation of mined areas was in progress. Output averaged 1 million tons each year.\n\nThe country was one of the few sources of amber in the Western Hemisphere. Salt Mountain, a 16&nbsp;km block of almost solid salt west of Barahona, was the world's largest known salt deposit. There were also large deposits of gypsum near Salt Mountain, making the Dominican Republic one of three sources of gypsum in the Caribbean. The country also produced hydraulic [[cement]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], and [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Substantial [[lignite]] deposits were found in the early 1980s. Deposits of [[copper]] and [[platinum]] are known to exist.\n\n==Industry==\n[[File:Tree map exports 2009 Dominican Republic.jpeg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Dominican Republic's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nThe industrial sector contributed an estimated 32.2 percent to the country's GDP in 1999, led by mining (ferronickel, gold, and silver) and the manufacture of goods for export to the United States. To a lesser extent, there is the manufacture of food products, consumer non-durables, and building materials for the local market and for neighboring Haiti. The sector employed mated 24.3 percent of the workforce in 1998.\n\nAbout 500 companies in the Dominican Republic manufacture goods primarily for the North American market. Situated in 50 industrial free zones around the country, these mostly foreign-owned corporations take advantage of generous tax and other financial inducements offered by the government to businesses that operate within the zones. Approximately 200,000 people, or about 8 percent of the workforce, are employed in this sector. They mostly produce clothing, electronic components, footwear, and leather goods, which are assembled. The raw materials or semi-manufactured goods are usually imported duty-free from other developing countries (electronic parts are imported from industrialized Puerto Rico) and put together in the free zones. Products created are [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[textile]]s, [[perfume]]s & foodstuffs. The value of exports amounted to US$1.9 billion in 1996, but the contribution to the trade balance was only US$520 million because many of the basic materials for the free zones had to be imported and paid for.\n\nOther, more traditional manufacturing is based on sugar refining, cement, iron and steel production, and food processing. Rum is a significant export commodity, and beer and cigarettes are manufactured for local consumption. Most industry of this sort is located around the working-class perimeter of Santo Domingo and other large towns.\n\n==Tertiary industries==\nServices were estimated to contribute 64.7% (2012 est.) of the GDP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economy of the Dominican Republic|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/dominican_republic/dominican_republic_economy.html|website=Theodora|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> In 1999 it was estimated to employ around 58.7 percent of the workforce, making this the most important sector of the Dominican economy.\n\n===Tourism===\nSince the mid-1980s the tourism sector has become one of the country\u2019s most important sources of foreign exchange, and more popular tourist destinations. The country is famous for its favorable location in the Caribbean, tropical climate, beaches, and the restored Spanish colonial architecture. Many foreign investors have and continue to be encouraged to invest here to build and expand resorts and airports around the coasts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Nancie|title=Tourism Dominican Republic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/168728/Dominican-Republic/54439/Services|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> During this same period, tourism displaced sugar as the main source of the country's earnings, and by 1997 it was generating more than half of the country's total foreign exchange.<ref name=\"trop. blues\">{{cite journal|last1=Cabezas|first1=Amalia|title=Tropical Blues: Tourism and Social Exclusion in the Dominican Republic|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=May 2008|volume=35|issue=3|pages=21\u201336}}</ref>\n\nTourism is the single biggest revenue earner, with receipts increasing more than tenfold from US$173 million in 1980 to more than US$2 billion by 2000. According to the Central Bank, the Dominican Republic received US$4.3 billion in revenues from the tourism sector in 2011.<ref name=\"DR HAS IT ALL\">{{cite web|title=Tourism Investment Guide|url=http://www.godominicanrepublic.com/rd/images/files/DR-guia%20inversiones%20ENG-LR.PDF|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140226145114/http://www.godominicanrepublic.com/rd/images/files/DR-guia%20inversiones%20ENG-LR.PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2014|website=Ministry of Tourism Dominican Republic|publisher=Ministry of Tourism Dominican Republic|accessdate=5 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Successive governments have invested heavily in tourism development, creating upgraded airports and other infrastructure. 2.1 million tourists arrived in the country in 1999, not including visiting Dominicans. Most come from Europe, with about 25 percent originating from the [[United States]] or [[Canada]]. The country now has almost 70,000 hotel rooms, more than any other Caribbean country. About 50,000 Dominicans are directly employed in this sector, mostly working in hotels, and another 110,000 are indirectly employed as taxi drivers, tour guides, or tourist-shop staff. Most tourists visit the Dominican Republic on account of its beaches, but there is an expanding eco-tourism and outdoor activity sector, focused on the country's mountains and wildlife.\n\nAlthough tourism generates large revenues, some scholars and activists argue that the development of tourism also has high impacts on many socioeconomic aspects. For instance, they argue that it involves ecological deterioration, profit leakage, social displacement, disported cultural patterns, rising land values, drugs and [[prostitution]].<ref name=\"trop. blues\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A small but affluent middle class can afford to shop at the former, while the large impoverished rural community resorts to buying small amounts of daily essentials from colmados (small stores that often double as bars). In an attempt to regulate the retail sector, the government has recently reformed taxation laws, so that small shops pay taxes on a regular monthly basis. Many transactions, however, go unrecorded.\n\n==Statistics==\n'''GDP:'''\n[[purchasing power parity]] - $172.4 billion (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - real growth rate:'''\n4.6% (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - per capita:'''\npurchasing power parity - $16.900 (2017 est.)\n\n'''GDP - composition by sector:'''\n''agriculture:''\n5.5%\n''industry:''\n33.8%\n''services:''\n60.8% (2017 est.)\n\n'''[[Inflation]] rate (consumer prices):'''\n3.3% (2017 est.)\n\n'''Labor force:'''\n4.732 million (2017 est.)\n\n'''Labor force - by occupation:'''\n''agriculture:''\n14.4%\n''industry:''\n20.8%\n''services:''\n64.7% (2014 est.)\n\n'''Unemployment rate:'''\n5.5% (2017 est.)\n\n'''Population below poverty line:'''\n30.5% (2016)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n''revenues:''\n$7.014 billion\n\n''expenditures:''\n$6.985 billion (2007 est.)\n\n'''Industries:'''\n[[tourism]], [[sugar]] processing, [[ferronickel]] and [[gold]] mining, [[textile]]s, [[cement]], [[tobacco]], [[electrical components]], [[medical devices]]\n\n'''Electricity - production:'''\n15.53 billion kWh (2015)\n\n'''Electricity - consumption:'''\n13.25 billion kWh (2015)\n\n'''Electricity - exports:'''\n0 kWh (2005)\n\n'''Electricity - imports:'''\n0 kWh (2005)\n\n'''Oil - production:''' {{convert|0|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2014)\n\n'''Oil - consumption:''' {{convert|122300|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2012 est.)\n\n'''Oil - exports:''' {{convert|0|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2017)\n\n'''Oil - imports:''' {{convert|116700|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2017)\n\n'''Oil - proved reserves:''' {{convert|0|oilbbl|abbr=on}} (1 January 2006 est.)\n\n'''Natural gas - production:''' 0 cu m (2005 est.)\n\n'''Natural gas - consumption:''' 1.108 million cu m (2015 est).\n\n'''Natural gas - exports:''' 0 cu m (2005 est.)\n\n'''Natural gas - imports:''' 1.108 million cu m (2015)\n\n'''Natural gas - proved reserves:''' 0 cu m (1 January 2006 est.)\n\n'''Agriculture - products:'''\n[[sugarcane]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tobacco]], [[rice]], [[bean]]s, [[potato]]es, [[Maize|corn]], [[banana]]s; [[cattle]], [[pig]]s, dairy products, [[beef]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]]\n\n'''Exports:'''\n$10.33 billion f.o.b.

Broadband Internet access is growing, with over 622,931 Internet accounts globally and 3,851,278  Internet users as of December, 2010 according to INDOTEL (DR Telecommunications Institute). Broadband DSL represents about 56% of the total Internet subscribers. There is access to regular ADSL, G.SHDSL, and services only on metropolitan areas, costs are high and service is decent. Cable Internet is offered by a couple of cable companies at lower costs than ADSL but the service is very deficient and unreliable. WiFi is becoming more common. It is available in some universities. Most hotels also offer wi-fi internet. The implementation of the [[WiMAX]] and [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] technology by some of the Cellphone service providers are resulting in the rapid investment by other providers in the market to match the new and faster platform of services. Mobile broadband user have seen their percentage grow from 14% in 2007 all the way to 39% in 2010, and will continue to grow as more and more users are opting for this type of technology in a country where Home Broadband speeds are more expensive and slower. Also the ongoing installation of a Fiber-Optic network structure in the National District and the City of Santiago (second largest in the country) will force other competitors into upgrading theirs to be able to compete in the markets they now lead.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}\n\n===Pricing===\n\nAs of October 2018, not including taxes.\n\nKey: DOP: [[Dominican peso]], USD: [[United States dollar]].

There are nearly {{Convert|19705|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of highways and roads, 9,872 being paved and {{Convert|9833|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} (2002 est.) unpaved. Like any underdeveloped nation, the Dominican Republic suffers from lack of good paved roads to connect smaller towns and less populated areas though they are working on it, however major town roads are kept in good condition.\n\n== Public transport ==\n\n=== Mass transit ===\n{{main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe [[Santo Domingo Metro]] is the first mass transit system in the country, and second in the Caribbean & Central American nations after the [[Tren Urbano]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  On February 27, 2008 the incumbent president [[Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez]] test rode the system for the first time and free service was offered thereafter several times.  Commercial service started on January 30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently being planned.\n\nThe [[Santiago light rail]] system is a planned light rail system in the Dominican Republic's second largest city, still in developing stages it was said to start on mid-2008 but right now is currently on hold due to lack of approval and of central government funds.\n\n===Buses===\nThe Dominican Republic has a bus system that is rather reliable, and most of these public transportation vehicles are fairly comfortable. The fare is generally inexpensive, and there are bus terminals and stops in most of the island's major cities.\n\n===Public Cars (''Carros P\u00fablicos'')===\nThe Public Cars (''[[Share taxi|Carros P\u00fablicos]]\u2013Conchos'') are privately owned passenger cars that transit a specific route daily and passengers pay a certain fee with the convenience of stopping anywhere.  This comprises one of the main ways of transportation inside the capital city of Santo Domingo, as well as other major cities.\nThis system though, is not very reliable and lacks discipline. The high number of public cars that travel the roads, and the fact that they do not lend themselves to regulation or central control, causes frequent transit problems among city roads. They may also be somewhat uncomfortable, since they try to fit as many people as possible inside them. As a standard, a 4-person sedan (driver included) usually carries 6 passengers, twice the amount for which they were designed.\n\n== Railways ==\n[[File:Dominican Republic rail map 1925.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rail map as of 1925]]\n{{main|Rail transport in the Dominican Republic}}\nRail operations are provided by one state owned operator and several private operators (mainly for sugar mills):\n* Central Romana Railroad was established in 1911 in the sugarcane fields.

The [[Santiago Light Rail]] has been planned to serve the city of [[Santiago de los Caballeros]].\n\n== Ports and harbors ==\nMajor ports and harbours in the Dominican Republic:\n\n===Ports===\n\n*The [[Port of Santo Domingo]], with its location in the Caribbean, is well suited for flexible itinerary planning and has excellent support, road, and airport infrastructure within the Santo Domingo region, which facilitate access and transfers. The port is suitable for both turnaround and transit calls.\n*[[Haina Occidental Port]], located just 20&nbsp;km west of [[Santo Domingo]], is one of the most important ports in the Dominican Republic. About 70% of all cargo, excluding Caucedo and free zone exports/imports, is moved through this port.\n*DP World's terminal [[Multimodal Caucedo Port]] maritime terminal and logistic center operates under the Free Zone Regime. Actually 85% of Free Zone exports to United States is shipped from Caucedo terminal. Multimodal Caucedo port is also able to act as a trans-shipment hub to the Caribbean and Latin America for Asia specifically Japan as a door to the American market.\n*[[Port of Puerto Plata]] is the main commercial port on the north coast of the Dominican Republic.\n*[[Port of Boca Chica]] is located about 20 miles east of the capital city and 5 miles of the International airport Las Americas.

The primary missions are to defend the nation and protect the territorial integrity of the country. The [[Dominican Republic]]'s military is second in size to [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Cuba's]] in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nThe [[Dominican Army|Army]], twice as large as the other services combined with about 56,789 active duty personnel, consists of six [[infantry]] brigades, an air cavalry squadron and a combat service support brigade. The [[Dominican Air Force|Air Force]] operates two main bases, one in southern region near [[Santo Domingo]] and one in the northern region of the country, the air force operates approximately 40 aircraft including helicopters. The [[Dominican Navy|Navy]] maintains three ageing vessels which were donated from the United States, around 25 patrol crafts and interceptor boats and two helicopters.\n\nThere is a counter-terrorist group formed by members of the three branches. This group is highly trained in counter-terrorism missions. The armed forces participate fully in counter-[[illegal drug trade]] efforts, for this task, there is a taskforce known as DEPROSER 24/7 (DEfender, PROteger y SERvir). They also are active in efforts to control [[contraband]] and [[illegal immigration]] from [[Haiti]] to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the [[United States]] (via illegal transportation of immigrants to [[Puerto Rico]]).\n\n==History==\n===War of Independence===\n\n[[File:Santo domingo 1850.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Brigantine|Brigantine Schooners]] in [[Santo Domingo]] circa 1850.]]\n\nHaiti under their president Jean-Pierre Boyer had invaded and occupied  Dominican Republic from 1822 to 1844.  The military forces of the First Republic's army comprised about 4,000 soldiers organized into seven line infantry regiments, several loose battalions, 6 escudrones [[cavalry]] and 3 [[artillery]] brigades with 2/2 brigades; This army was supplemented with national civic guard militia composed of the provinces, the National Naval Armada, original name of the Navy today; It composed of 10 ships, seven owned and 3 taken in requici\u00f3n and armed by the government: the [[Cibao]] frigate with 20 cannons; the brigantine [[schooner]] San Jose, five guns; the schooner La Libertad, five guns; General schooner Santana 7 guns; the schooner La Merced, five guns; Separation schooner, 3 guns; the schooner February 27, five guns. The requisition taken: the schooner Maria Luisa, 3 guns; the schooner March 30, 3 guns; and the schooner Hope, 3 guns. 674 operated by a man. In addition to the aforementioned military corps expeditionary southern army recruited by Pedro and Ramon Santana in [[Hato Mayor Province|Hato Mayor]] and [[El Seibo]], with a permit issued by the Central Governing Board with the rank of commander in chief of the army existed. These men were skilled in handling machete and spear. His deputy commander was Brigadier General Antonio Duverg\u00e9. The other expeditionary army was the Northern Borders created to defend these borders: its commander was Major General Francisco A. Salcedo.\n\nThe Dominican forces would reach levels of organization and efficiency of considerable notoriety. As an example of this, it would suffice to highlight the fact of the achievement and preservation of National Independence, with the Dominican victory over repeated Haitian military invasions in the 12-year period that followed the proclamation of Independence; In addition, 55 percent of the National Budget was allocated to it.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Dominician Anti Terrorism Commandos coming out of helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dominican Republic commandos in counter-terrorist and counter-illegal drug trade operations.]]\n\nThe events that led to the [[United States]] military intervention of 1916, brought about the disappearance of any vestige of military structure in the [[Dominican Republic]], setting the intervening forces a military government headed by Captain William Knapp, who make an interim police force called \"Constabulary \"equivalent to an\" armed police force as a military unit \"and he had the task of maintaining internal order and enforce the implementing provisions of the US government. This body, purely police function disappears in 1917, leading to the creation of a National Guard. As a result of this historic event of our recent past, the country inherited a hierarchical and organizational akin to the US Marine Corps structure, which served as a platform to the transformations that later gave rise to the armed forces we know today, made up of three components, terrestrial one, one naval and one air.\n\nThis land component, now called the National Army, inherited by both its organizational structure of the National Guard organized by the US occupation forces, which operated from April 7, 1917 until June 1921, when it becomes Dominican National Police by Executive Order No. 631 of Rear Admiral Thomas Snowden, who was at that time the military governor of [[Santo Domingo]]. After the US military occupation in 1924, [[Horacio V\u00e1squez]] wins the presidential elections of that same year. Among his first decisions, decrees the change of the Dominican National Police in National Brigade, a situation that continues until 17 May 1928, when new turn changes the name of the Army by Law No. 928, but basically inheriting a structure Police, who obeyed schemes imposition of public order demanded by the country at that time and not those of an army in their typical roles.\n\nDue to its characteristics and missions, organizational structure that demanded presence throughout the country, which was realized with the creation of posts and detachments in different parts of the country and the establishment in some provinces of company size units, many of which still Army retains today. Over the years and already existing National Police created by decree No. 1523 of March 2, 1936 of [[Rafael Trujillo|President Trujillo]], many of these units, posts and detachments became part of it, perfectly adapted to its structure, since These were essentially created to play a policing role. So great was the influence that had the National Guard in Dominican society and very particularly in the rural population, which even today are many Dominicans who often referred to the Armed Forces and unique way to the Army as \" The Guard \".\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Navy]] has remained since its inception attached to the principles that gave rise, assuming only two name changes since its inception, but gradually evolving the transformation of what was a body created for military purposes, capable of landing and ships with weapons to face possible naval invasions, to be a component mainly responsible for enforcing the provisions on navigation, trade and fishing, as well as international treaties\n\nThe Dominican Air Force, meanwhile, emerges as an independent component in 1948, under the chairmanship of Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo Molina, with characteristics of innovation and modernism, which gave mobility, versatility and depth to the [[Armed Forces]] and the complement in the following years would become: a military capacity to project military power in the Caribbean environment. The situation of this air component has changed significantly after reaching its climax in the 50s, when it was one of the best air force equipped in the region, which was due to the strategic guidelines of a long-lived military dictatorship It made efforts to stay in power and he saw in this component one of its mainstays against any invasion or subversion against the dictatorship.\n\n==Current Forces==\n===Army of the Dominican Republic===\n\nIts basic strength is concentrated in the infantry which in general can be said to be well equipped with combat rifles and combat equipment for soldiers. The vehicles (both transport and armored vehicles) and the artillery and anti-tank pieces that are in service. Currently, tanks and modern armor systems have been included.\n\n===Navy of the Dominican Republic===\n\nThe Dominican Navy was founded in 1844 also with the National Independence with 15,000 troops after Haiti had occupied the eastern part of the island for twenty five years. It keeps around 34 ships in operation, mostly coast guards, patrol boats and small speedboats. It also operates dredges, tugboats and patrol boats of height. The Navy has a small air body composed helicopter utilities Bell OH-58C Kiowa.\n\nThe Navy operates two main bases, one in the port of Santo Domingo in the Dominican capital called \"Naval Base 27 de Febrero\" and another in Bah\u00eda de las Calderas, in the province of Peravia, called Las Calderas Naval Base in the southern part from the country. It also has presence in the commercial ports of the country, comandancias of ports and is divided into three naval areas that in turn have posts and naval detachments.\n\n===Air Force of the Dominican Republic===\n\nThe Dominican Air Force was founded in 1948 with 20,000 people. It has two main bases: the base area of San Isidro in the South-Central zone of the country near the capital city Santo Domingo; and the other operates jointly in the civil facilities belonging to the Gregorio Luper\u00f3n International Airport, near the city of Puerto Plata in the North of the Republic. Until August 2009, the possibility of starting military operations from the Mar\u00eda Montez airport, in the city of Barahona in the Southwest of the country and from the Punta Cana airport in the extreme east is under study.\n\nIt keeps the following fixed-wing aircraft in operation: 8 Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano, 3 CASA C-212-400 transport; 6 T35B Pilot training; as well as around 25 helicopters such as Bell 206, Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Bell OH-58 Kiowa, Eurocopter Dauphin, OH-6 Cayuse and Sikorsky S-300.\n\n==Special Forces==\n\nThe Specialized Security Corps are military security agencies dependent on the Ministry of the Armed Forces. and they are made up of military and civilian personnel specialized in their different areas of function.

The Embassy estimates that 100,000 U.S. citizens live in the Dominican Republic; many are dual nationals. An important element of the relationship between the two countries is the fact that more than 1 million individuals of Dominican origin reside in the United States, most of them in the metropolitan Northeast and some in [[Florida]].\n\nU.S. relations with the Dominican Republic are excellent. The Dominican Government has been supportive of many U.S. initiatives in the United Nations and related agencies. The two governments cooperate in the fight against the traffic in illegal substances. The Dominican Republic has worked closely with U.S. law enforcement officials on issues such as the extradition of fugitives and measures to hinder illegal migration.\n\nThe United States supports efforts to improve Dominican competitiveness, to attract foreign private investment, to fight corruption, and to modernize the tax system. Bilateral trade is important to both countries. U.S. firms, mostly manufacturers of apparel, footwear, and light electronics, as well as U.S. energy companies, account for much of the foreign private investment in the Dominican Republic.\n\nExports from the United States, including those from Puerto Rico and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], to the Dominican Republic in 2005 totaled $5.3 billion, up 11% from the previous year. The Dominican Republic exported $4.5 billion to the United States in 2006, equaling some 75% of its export revenues. The Dominican Republic is the 47th-largest commercial partner of the U.S. The U.S. Embassy works closely with U.S. business firms and Dominican trade groups, both of which can take advantage of the new opportunities in this growing market. At the same time, the embassy is working with the Dominican Government to resolve a range of ongoing commercial and investment disputes.\n\nThe Embassy counsels U.S. firms through its Country Commercial Guide and informally via meetings with business persons planning to invest or already investing in the Dominican Republic. This is a challenging business environment for U.S. firms, especially for medium to smaller sized businesses.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mission is focused on improving access of underserved populations to quality health care and combating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; promoting economic growth through policy reform, support for [[CAFTA-DR]] implementation, and technical assistance to small producers and tourism groups; environmental protection and policy reform initiatives; improved access to quality primary, public education and assistance to at-risk youth; a model rural electrification program; and improving participation in democratic processes, while strengthening the judiciary and combating corruption across all sectors.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35639.htm U.S. Department of State: Dominican Republic]</ref>\n\n{{course assignment | course = Education Program:Manhattanville College/International Trade (Spring 2015) | term = Spring 2015 }}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Venezuela}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nThe Dominican Republic and Venezuela have kept a very close relationship throughout the early 2000s.

The Dominican Government has to export so many beans to Venezuela, Over 10,000 tons, that it had to start to import some beans from foreign countries to provide the population with beans.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2013/0327/Petrocaribe-Paying-beans-for-Venezuelan-oil</ref>\n\nIn January 2015 the Dominican Government raised almost 2 billion dollars to pay off part of the debt they owed to Venezuela.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/dominican-republic-taps-1-9-billion-to-pay-venezuelan-oil-debt</ref> The Dominican Republic currently represents a 1.5 billion dollar year revenue to Venezuela just in the oil business itself, which is the reason why the Dominican Republic and Venezuela government have such a strong connection now that both countries are getting what they need from each other.\n|}\n\n==Multilateral relations==\nThe Dominican Republic is a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and many of its specialized and related agencies, including the [[World Bank]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[International Civil Aviation Organization]].

Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also emotionally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.\n\nDeath due to disease is called [[death by natural causes]]. There are four main types of disease: [[infectious disease]]s, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] and [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-genetic hereditary diseases]]), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as [[transmission (medicine)|communicable]] versus [[non-communicable disease|non-communicable]] diseases.

See [[Help:List#List basics]] for more information.  Please do not change the formatting unless you know what you're doing.  -->\n;Disease\n:The term ''disease'' broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body. For this reason, diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal [[homeostasis#Examples of some of the better understood physiological homeostats|homeostatic processes]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://regentsprep.org/regents/biology/units/homeostasis/index.cfm |title = Regents Prep: Living Environment: Homeostasis |publisher = Oswego City School District Regents Exam Prep Center |accessdate = 12 November 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025044155/http://regentsprep.org/Regents/biology/units/homeostasis/index.cfm |archivedate = 25 October 2012 |df = }}</ref>  Commonly, the term is used to refer specifically to [[infectious disease]]s, which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of [[pathogenic]] microbial agents, including viruses, [[bacteria]], fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and aberrant proteins known as [[prion]]s.  An [[infection]] or [[colony (biology)|colonization]] that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning, such as the presence of the normal [[gut flora|bacteria and yeasts in the gut]], or of a [[passenger virus]], is not considered a disease. By contrast, an infection that is asymptomatic during its [[incubation period]], but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered a disease.  [[Non-infectious disease]]s are all other diseases, including most forms of [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and [[genetic disease]].\n;Acquired disease \n:An acquired disease is one that began at some point during one's lifetime, as opposed to disease that was already present at birth, which is [[congenital disorder|congenital disease]]. ''Acquired'' sounds like it could mean \"caught via contagion\", but it simply means acquired sometime after birth. It also sounds like it could imply secondary disease, but acquired disease can be primary disease.\n;Acute disease \n:An acute disease is one of a short-term nature ([[acute (medicine)|acute]]); the term sometimes also [[connotation|connotes]] a [[fulminant]] nature\n;Chronic condition or chronic disease\n:A [[chronic condition|chronic disease]] is one that persists over time, often characterized six months or more.\n;Congenital disorder or congenital disease\n: A [[congenital disorder]] is one that is present at [[birth]]. It is often a [[genetic disorder|genetic disease or disorder]] and can be [[heredity|inherited]]. It can also be the result of a [[vertically transmitted infection]] from the mother, such as [[HIV/AIDS]].\n;Genetic disease\n:A [[Genetic disorder|genetic disorder or disease]]  is caused by one or more genetic [[mutation]]s. It is often inherited, but some mutations are random and [[wikt:de novo|de novo]].\n;Hereditary or inherited disease \n:A hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are [[heredity|hereditary]] (and can run in families)\n;Iatrogenic disease\n:An [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic disease]] or condition is one that caused by medical intervention, whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome. \n;Idiopathic disease\n:An [[idiopathic disease]] has an unknown cause or source. As medical science has advanced, many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status. For example, when germs were discovered, it became known that they were a cause of infection, but particular germs and diseases had not been linked. In another example, it is known that [[autoimmunity]] is the cause of some forms of [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood. It is also common to know certain factors are [[association (statistics)|associated]] with certain diseases. However, association and causality are two very different phenomena, as a third cause might be producing the disease, as well as an associated phenomenon.\n;Incurable disease \n:A disease that cannot be [[cure]]d. Incurable diseases are not necessarily [[terminal disease]]s, and sometimes a disease's symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on [[quality of life]].\n;Primary disease\n:A primary disease is a disease that is due to a [[root cause]] of illness, as opposed to secondary disease, which is a [[sequela]], or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] that is caused by the primary disease.  For example, a [[common cold]] is a primary disease, where [[rhinitis]] is a possible secondary disease, or [[sequela]]. A doctor must determine what primary disease, a cold or a bacterial infection, is causing a patient's secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics. \n;Secondary disease \n:A secondary disease is a disease that is a [[sequela]] or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of a prior, causal disease, which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause ([[root cause]]). For example, a bacterial infection can be primary, wherein a healthy person is exposed to a bacteria and becomes infected, or it can be secondary to a primary cause, that predisposes the body to infection. For example, a primary [[viral infection]] that weakens the [[immune system]] could lead to a secondary bacterial infection. Similarly, a primary [[burn]] that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria, and lead to a secondary bacterial infection.\n;Terminal disease \n:A terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death. Previously, AIDS was a terminal disease; it is now incurable, but can be managed indefinitely using medications. \n;Illness\n:The terms Illness and sickness are both generally used as a synonym for disease.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/illness |title = illness |work = [[Dorland's Medical Dictionary]] for Health Consumers |year = 2007 |publisher = Elsevier |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000096725|sickness}}</ref> However, the term ''illness'' is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease.<ref name=\"pmid3567788\">{{cite journal |author = Emson HE |title = Health, disease and illness: matters for definition |journal = [[CMAJ]] |volume = 136 |issue = 8 |pages = 811\u20133 |date = April 1987 |pmid = 3567788 |pmc = 1492114 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid3567791\">{{cite journal |author = McWhinney IR |title = Health and disease: problems of definition |journal = CMAJ |volume = 136 |issue = 8 |page = 815 |date = April 1987 |pmid = 3567791 |pmc = 1492121 }}</ref>  In this model, it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill (to have an objectively definable, but [[asymptomatic]], medical condition, such as a [[subclinical infection]]), and to be ''ill'' without being ''diseased'' (such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition, or [[medicalization|medicalizes]] a non-disease situation in his or her life\u2014for example, a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment, and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions). Symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection, but a collection of [[evolutionary medicine|evolved responses]]\u2014[[sickness behavior]] by the body\u2014that helps clear infection and promote recovery.

However, the term ''disorder'' is also used in many other areas of medicine, primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms, such as [[metabolic disorder]]s.\n;Medical condition\n:A '''medical condition''' is a broad term that includes all diseases, [[lesion]]s, disorders, or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment, such as [[pregnancy]] or [[childbirth]].  While the term ''medical condition'' generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all [[mental disorder]]s, uses the term ''general medical condition'' to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for [[mental disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite book |publisher = American Psychiatric Association |year = 2000 |title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition = 4th |location = Washington, DC |author = American Psychiatric Association Task Force on DSM-IV |isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 }}</ref> This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature.

On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the [[autism rights movement]].\n:The term ''medical condition'' is also a synonym for ''[[medical state]]'', in which case it describes an individual patient's current state from a medical standpoint.  This usage appears in statements that describe a patient as being ''in critical condition'', for example.\n;{{Visible anchor|Morbidity}}\n:'''Morbidity''' ({{ety|la|morbidus|sick, unhealthy}}) is a diseased state, [[disability]], or poor health due to any cause.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/morbidity |title = morbidity |work = Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers |year = 2007 |publisher = Elsevier |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}</ref> The term may be used to refer to the existence of any form of disease, or to the degree that the health condition affects the patient.  Among severely ill patients, the level of morbidity is often measured by [[ICU scoring systems]].  [[Comorbidity]] is the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[substance abuse]].\n:In [[epidemiology]] and [[actuarial science]], the term \"morbidity rate\" can refer to either the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate, or the [[prevalence]] of a disease or medical condition. This measure of sickness is contrasted with the [[mortality rate]] of a condition, which is the proportion of people dying during a given time interval. Morbidity rates are used in actuarial professions, such as health insurance, life insurance and long-term care insurance, to determine the correct premiums to charge to customers. Morbidity rates help insurers predict the likelihood that an insured will contract or develop any number of specified diseases.\n;Pathosis or pathology\n:''Pathosis'' (plural ''pathoses'') is synonymous with ''disease''. The word ''[[pathology]]'' also has this [[word sense|sense]], in which it is commonly used by physicians in the [[medical literature]], although [[wikt:pathology#Usage notes|some editors prefer to reserve ''pathology'' to its other senses]]. Sometimes a slight [[connotation|connotative]] shade causes preference for ''pathology'' or ''pathosis'' implying \"some [as yet poorly analyzed] [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic process]]\" rather than ''disease'' implying \"a specific disease entity as defined by diagnostic criteria being already met\". This is hard to quantify [[denotation|denotatively]], but it explains why [[cognitive synonymy]] is not invariable.\n;Syndrome\n:A [[syndrome]] is the association of several [[medical sign]]s, [[symptom]]s, or other characteristics that often occur together.  Some syndromes, such as [[Down syndrome]], have only one cause.  Others, such as [[Parkinsonian syndrome]], have multiple possible causes. For example, [[acute coronary syndrome]] is not a single disease itself, but rather the manifestation of any of several diseases, such as [[myocardial infarction]] secondary to [[coronary artery disease]]. In yet other syndromes, the [[idiopathy|cause is unknown]].  A familiar syndrome name often remains in use even after an underlying cause has been found, or when there are a number of different possible primary causes. Examples of the first-mentioned type are that [[Turner syndrome]] and [[DiGeorge syndrome]] are still often called by the \"syndrome\" name despite that they can also be viewed as disease entities and not solely as sets of signs and symptoms. \n;Predisease\n:'''Predisease''' is a [[subclinical]] or [[prodrome|prodromal]] vanguard of a disease. [[Prediabetes]] and [[prehypertension]] are common examples. The [[nosology]] or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a [[bright line]] differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical/prodromal/premonitory status (on one hand) and [[conflict of interest]]\u2013driven [[disease mongering]] or [[medicalization]] (on the other hand). Identifying legitimate predisease can result in useful preventive measures, such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise,<ref name=\"Lenzer\">{{cite news |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2012/08/blood_pressure_drugs_for_mild_hypertension_not_proven_to_prevent_heart_attacks_strokes_or_early_death.single.html |title = Blood pressure drugs for mild hypertension: Not proven to prevent heart attacks, strokes, or early death |last = Lenzer |first = Jeanne |date = 14 August 2012 |work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate = 16 August 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120815202802/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2012/08/blood_pressure_drugs_for_mild_hypertension_not_proven_to_prevent_heart_attacks_strokes_or_early_death.single.html |archivedate = 15 August 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> but labeling a healthy person with an unfounded notion of predisease can result in [[overtreatment]], such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or paying for drug prescription instances whose [[benefit\u2013cost ratio]] is minuscule (placing it in the waste category of [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]]' \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" classification).

Second, there must be a feasible intervention that, when targeted to people with predisease, effectively reduces the likelihood of developing disease. Third, the benefits of intervening on predisease must outweigh the harms in the population.}}</ref>\n\n=== Types by body system ===\n\n;Mental\n:[[Mental disorder|Mental illness]] is a broad, generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or [[emotion]]al instability, behavioral dysregulation, cognitive dysfunction or impairment.  Specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], generalized [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[schizophrenia]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], to name a few. Mental illness can be of biological (e.g., anatomical, chemical, or genetic) or psychological (e.g., trauma or conflict) origin. It can impair the affected person's ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationships.  The term [[insanity]] is used technically as a legal term.\n;Organic\n:An organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body.  The term sometimes excludes infections.  It is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders.  It includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body, such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, but not if they are due to [[psychosocial]] issues.\n\n=== Stages ===\n{{redirect|Flareup|the Transformers character|Flareup (Transformers)}}\n\nIn an infectious disease, the [[incubation period]] is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms.  The [[latency period]] is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person, which may precede, follow, or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms.  Some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase, called [[viral latency]], in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state.  For example, [[varicella zoster virus]] causes [[chickenpox]] in the [[acute (medicine)|acute phase]]; after recovery from chickenpox, the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years, and later cause [[herpes zoster]] (shingles).\n;Acute disease\n:An [[acute disease]] is a short-lived disease, like the [[common cold]].\n;Chronic disease\n:A [[chronic disease]] is one that lasts for a long time, usually at least six months.  During that time, it may be constantly present, or it may go into [[remission (medicine)|remission]] and periodically [[relapse]].  A chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive (gets worse over time).  Some chronic diseases can be permanently cured.  Most chronic diseases can be beneficially treated, even if they cannot be permanently cured.\n;Clinical disease\n:One that has clinical consequences; in other words, the stage of the disease that produces the characteristic signs and symptoms of that disease.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/clinical+disease |title = clinical disease |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date =  |work = Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition = 9th |year = 2009 |publisher = Elsevier |quote = a stage in the history of a pathological condition that begins with anatomical or physiological changes that are sufficient to produce recognizable signs and symptoms of a disease |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}</ref>  [[AIDS]] is the clinical disease stage of [[HIV infection]].\n;Cure\n:A [[cure]] is the end of a medical condition or a treatment that is very likely to end it, while [[Remission (medicine)|remission]] refers to the disappearance, possibly temporarily, of symptoms.  Complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases.\n;Flare-up\n:A flare-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms.\n;Progressive disease\n:[[Progressive disease]] is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease until death, serious debility, or organ failure occurs.  Slowly progressive diseases are also [[chronic disease]]s; many are also [[degenerative disease]]s.  The opposite of progressive disease is ''stable disease'' or ''static disease'':  a medical condition that exists, but does not get better or worse.\n;{{Visible anchor|Refractory disease}}\n:A refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment, especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for the specific disease in question.\n;Subclinical disease\n:Also called '''silent disease''', '''silent stage''', or '''asymptomatic disease'''.  This is a stage in some diseases before the symptoms are first noted.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subclinical |title = subclinical |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date =  |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}</ref>\n;Terminal phase\n:If a person will die soon from a disease, regardless of whether that disease typically causes death, then the stage between the earlier disease process and active dying is the terminal phase.\n\n=== Extent ===\n\n;Localized disease\n:A [[localized disease]] is one that affects only one part of the body, such as [[athlete's foot]] or an [[eye infection]].\n;Disseminated disease\n:A [[disseminated disease]] has spread to other parts; with cancer, this is usually called [[metastatic disease]].\n;Systemic disease\n:A [[systemic disease]] is a disease that affects the entire body, such as [[influenza]] or [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].\n\n== Classifications ==\n{{Main|nosology}}\n\nDiseases may be classified by cause, [[pathogenesis]] ([[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]] by which the disease is caused), or by [[symptom]](s). Alternatively, diseases may be classified according to the [[organ system]] involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.\n\nA chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown.  Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms ([[syndrome]]).\n\nClassical classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Today it is preferred to classify them by their cause if it is known.<ref>Loscalzo J1, Kohane I, Barabasi AL. Human disease classification in the postgenomic era: a complex systems approach to human pathobiology.\nMol Syst Biol. 2007;3:124. Epub 2007 Jul 10.</ref>\n\nThe most known and used classification of diseases is the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]. This is periodically updated. Currently the last publication is the [[ICD-10]].\n\n== Causes ==\n{{See also|Cause (medicine)|Transmission (medicine)}}\n\nOnly some diseases such as [[influenza]] are contagious and commonly believed infectious. The micro-organisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. [[Infectious disease]]s can be transmitted, e.g. by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces, by bites of [[vector (epidemiology)|insects or other carriers]] of the disease, and from contaminated water or food (often via [[feces|fecal]] contamination), etc.<ref>Alexander van Geen, et al. \"Impact of population and latrines on fecal contamination of ponds in rural Bangladesh.\" Science Of The Total Environment 409, no. 17 (August 2011): 3174-3182.</ref>  Also, there are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. In some cases, [[microorganism]]s that are not readily spread from person to person play a role, while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate [[nutrition]] or other lifestyle changes.\n\nSome diseases, such as most (but [[Infectious cancer|not all]]) forms of [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and mental disorders, are [[non-infectious disease]]s. Many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis (see [[genetic disorder]]) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another.\n\n[[Social determinants of health]] are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health. Illnesses are generally related to social, economic, political, and [[Environmental disease|environmental circumstances]]. Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the Public Health Agency of [[Canada]] and the World Health Organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council also recognizes [[Social determinants of health in poverty]].\n\nWhen the cause of a disease is poorly understood, societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a [[metaphor]] or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil.  For example, until the bacterial cause of [[tuberculosis]] was discovered in 1882, experts variously ascribed the disease to [[hereditary disease|heredity]], a [[sedentary lifestyle]], [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]], and overindulgence in sex, rich food, or alcohol\u2014all the [[social ills]] of the time.<ref>{{cite book |author = Olson, James Stuart |title = Bathsheba's breast: women, cancer & history |publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |location = Baltimore |year = 2002 |pages = 168\u2013170 |isbn = 0-8018-6936-6 }}</ref>\n\nWhen a disease is caused by a pathogen (e.g., when the disease [[malaria]] is caused by infection by ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites.), the term ''disease'' may be misleadingly used even in the scientific literature in place of its causal agent, the pathogen. This language habit can cause confusion in the communication of the cause-effect principle in [[epidemiology]], and as such it should be strongly discouraged.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marcantonio|first1=Matteo|last2=Pascoe|first2=Emily|last3=Baldacchino|first3=Frederic|date=January 2017|title=Sometimes Scientists Get the Flu.

See [[Help:List]] before changing.  -->\n;Airborne: An [[airborne disease]] is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air.\n;Foodborne: [[Foodborne illness]] or food poisoning is any illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, prions or parasites.\n;Infectious:  [[Infectious disease]]s, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, comprise clinically evident illness (i.e., characteristic medical signs or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection, presence and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism. Included in this category are ''[[contagious disease]]s'' \u2013 an infection, such as [[influenza]] or the [[common cold]], that commonly spreads from one person to another \u2013 and ''[[communicable disease]]s'' \u2013 a disease that can spread from one person to another, but does not necessarily spread through everyday contact.\n; Lifestyle: A [[lifestyle disease]] is any disease that appears to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer, especially if the risk factors include behavioral choices like a sedentary lifestyle or a diet high in unhealthful foods such as refined carbohydrates, trans fats, or alcoholic beverages.\n; Non-communicable: A [[non-communicable disease]] is a medical condition or disease that is non-transmissible.  Non-communicable diseases cannot be spread directly from one person to another.  [[Heart disease]] and [[cancer]] are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans.\n\n== Prevention ==\n{{Main|Preventive medicine}}\n\nMany diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means.  These include [[sanitation]], proper [[nutrition]], adequate [[exercise]], [[vaccination]]s and other [[self-care]] and [[public health]] measures.\n\n== Treatments ==\n{{Main|Therapy}}\n\nMedical [[therapy|therapies]] or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problem.  In the medical field, therapy is synonymous with the word ''treatment''.  Among psychologists, the term may refer specifically to [[psychotherapy]] or \"talk therapy\".  Common treatments include [[medication]]s, [[surgery]], [[medical devices]], and [[self-care]].  Treatments may be provided by an organized [[health care system]], or informally, by the patient or family members.\n\n[[Preventive healthcare]] is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, or disease in the first place.  A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started.  A treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem, but treatments may not produce permanent cures, especially in [[chronic diseases]].  [[Cure]]s are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently.  Many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable. [[Pain management]] (also called pain medicine) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain.<ref>{{cite book |title = Chronic Pain Management: The Essentials |author1 = Hardy, Paul A. |author2 = Hardy, Paul A.

Some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas, among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics, or at different times of the year.\n\nEpidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in [[evidence-based medicine]] for identifying [[risk factor]]s for disease. In the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the work of epidemiologists ranges from [[outbreak]] investigation to study design, data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a [[syndemic]]. Epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as [[biology]] (to better understand disease processes), [[biostatistics]] (the current raw information available), [[Geographic Information Science]] (to store data and map disease patterns) and [[social science]] disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors).  Epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts.\n\nIn studying diseases, epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them.  Especially for poorly understood diseases, different groups might use significantly different definitions.  Without an agreed-on definition, different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/health/research/08fatigue.html |title = Defining an illness is fodder for debate |author = Tuller, David |newspaper = The New York Times |date = 4 March 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170103054656/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/health/research/08fatigue.html |archivedate = 3 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities, at national levels<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/national-hospital-morbidity-database/ |title = National Hospital Morbidity Database |website = aihw.gov.au |publisher = [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] |access-date = 11 July 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813000437/http://aihw.gov.au/national-hospital-morbidity-database/ |archivedate = 13 August 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3203&Item_Id=1724 |title = Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB) |date =  |work = statcan.gc.ca |publisher = Statistics Canada |accessdate = 21 September 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160630153315/http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3203&Item_Id=1724 |archivedate = 30 June 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> or larger scale (such as European Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB))<ref>{{cite web |url = http://data.euro.who.int/hmdb/ |title = European Hospital Morbidity Database |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130902224516/http://data.euro.who.int/hmdb/ |archivedate = 2 September 2013 |website = who.int |publisher = World Health Organization |access-date = }}</ref> which may contain hospital discharge data by detailed diagnosis, age and sex.

The [[years of potential life lost]] (YPLL) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease.  For example, if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease, and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease, then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of potential life.  YPLL measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying, so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent.  In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] calculated that 932 million years of potential life were lost to premature death.<ref name=WHODALY />\n\nThe [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY) and [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) metrics are similar, but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis.  In addition to the number of years lost due to premature death, these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick.  Unlike YPLL, these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick, but who live a normal lifespan.  A disease that has high morbidity, but low mortality, has a high DALY and a low YPLL.  In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 1.5 billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury.<ref name=WHODALY>{{cite web |publisher = World Health Organization |website = who.int |url = http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |title = Disease and injury regional estimates for 2004 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2010 |df = }} Standard DALYs (3% discounting, age weights).

As a comparison, consider [[pregnancy]], which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness, even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care.\n\nMost religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick. For example, one whose life would be endangered by  [[fasting]] on [[Yom Kippur]] or during [[Ramadan]] is exempted from the requirement, or even forbidden from participating.  People who are sick are also exempted from social duties.  For example, ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an American to refuse an invitation to the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite book |author = Martin, Judith |title = Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior |publisher = W.W.

The controversial recognitions as diseases of [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI) and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (also known as \"[[Da Costa's syndrome|Soldier's heart]]\", \"[[shell shock]]\", and \"combat fatigue\") has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing [[senescence|aging]] as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.\n\n[[Leprosy|Lepers]] were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease, and the term \"leper\" still evokes [[social stigma]]. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.\n\nSocial standing and economic status affect health.  [[Diseases of poverty]] are diseases that are associated with [[poverty]] and low social status; [[diseases of affluence]] are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status.  Which diseases are associated with which states varies according to time, place, and technology.  Some diseases, such as [[diabetes mellitus]], may be associated with both poverty (poor food choices) and affluence (long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles), through different mechanisms.  The term [[lifestyle disease]]s describes diseases associated with longevity and that are more common among older people.  For example, [[cancer]] is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of 80 than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of 50.\n\n=== Language of disease ===\n\nAn [[illness narrative]] is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual's personal experience.\n\nPeople use [[metaphor]]s to make sense of their experiences with disease.  The metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an [[affective]] experience.  The most popular metaphors draw on [[military]] concepts:  Disease is an enemy that must be feared, fought, battled, and routed.  The patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior, rather than a passive victim or bystander. The agents of communicable diseases are invaders; non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war.  Because the threat is urgent, perhaps a matter of life and death, unthinkably radical, even oppressive, measures are society's and the patient's moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction.  The [[War on Cancer]] is an example of this metaphorical use of language.<ref name=Gwyn>{{cite book |author = Gwyn, Richard |editor1 = Cameron, Lynne |editor2 = Low, Graham |title = Researching and applying metaphor |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge, England |year = 1999 |chapter = 10 |isbn = 978-0-521-64964-3 |oclc = 40881885 }}</ref>  This language is empowering to some patients, but leaves others feeling like they are failures.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |title = Fighting Words Are Rarer Among British Doctors |url = http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/fighting-words-are-rare-among-british-doctors |author = Span, Paula |date = 22 April 2014 |newspaper = The New York Times |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140702025715/http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/fighting-words-are-rare-among-british-doctors |archivedate = 2 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnother class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey:  The person travels to or from a place of disease, and changes himself, discovers new information, or increases his experience along the way.  He may travel \"on the road to recovery\" or make changes to \"get on the right track\" or choose \"pathways\".<ref name=Gwyn /><ref name=\":0\" /> Some are explicitly immigration-themed:  the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill, changing identity and relationships in the process.<ref name=Diedrich>{{cite book |author = Diedrich, Lisa |title = Treatments: language, politics, and the culture of illness |publisher = University of Minnesota Press |location = Minneapolis |year = 2007 |pages = 8, 29 |isbn = 978-0-8166-4697-5 |oclc = 601862594 }}</ref>  This language is more common among British healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome metaphors are disease-specific.  [[Slavery]] is a common metaphor for [[addiction]]s:  The alcoholic is enslaved by drink, and the smoker is captive to nicotine.

One of the world's narrowest straits used for [[International waterway|international navigation]], the Dardanelles connects the [[Sea of Marmara]] with the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and  [[Mediterranean Sea]]s, while also allowing passage to the [[Black Sea]] by extension via the [[Bosphorus]]. The Dardanelles is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point abreast the city of [[\u00c7anakkale]].\n\nMost of the northern shores of the strait along the [[Gallipoli]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Gelibolu}}) are sparsely settled, while the southern shores along the [[Troad]] Peninsula ({{lang-tr|Biga}}) are inhabited by the city of \u00c7anakkale's urban population of 110,000.\n\nTogether with the [[Bosphorus]], the Dardanelles forms the [[Turkish Straits]].\n\n==Name==\n\nThe contemporary Turkish name ''\u00c7anakkale Bo\u011faz\u0131'', meaning \"\u00c7anakkale Strait\", is derived from the [[\u00c7anakkale|eponymous midsize city]] that adjoins the strait, itself meaning \"Pottery Fort\"\u2014from ''\u00c7anak'' (pottery) + ''Kale'' (Fortress)\u2014in reference to the area's famous pottery and ceramic wares, and the landmark Ottoman fortress of Sultaniye.\n\nThe English name ''Dardanelles'' derives from the older name ''Strait of the Dardanelles''.

It was variously named in classical literature ''Hellespontium Pelagus'', ''Rectum Hellesponticum'', and ''Fretum Hellesponticum''. It was so called from [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, who was drowned here in the mythology of the [[Golden Fleece]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAs a [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] [[waterway]], the Dardanelles connects various seas along the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Near East]], and [[Western Eurasia]], and specifically connects the [[Aegean Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Marmara further connects to the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Bosphorus]], while the Aegean further links to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Thus, the Dardanelles allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].\n\nThe strait is located at approximately {{coord|40|13|N|26|26|E|}}.\n\n===Present morphology===\n\nThe strait is {{convert|61|km|mi}} long, and {{convert|1.2|to|6|km|mi}} wide, averaging {{convert|55|m|ft}} deep with a maximum depth of {{convert|103|m|ft}} at its narrowest point at [[Nara Burnu]], abreast [[\u00c7anakkale]].<ref>Nautical Chart at GeoHack-Dardanelles, Map Tech</ref> There are two major currents through the strait: a [[surface current]] flows from the Black Sea towards the Aegean Sea, and a more saline [[subsurface current|undercurrent]] flows in the opposite direction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rozak\u0113s|first1=Chr\u0113stos L.|title=The Turkish Straits|date=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9024734649|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJc7HWhF-K8C|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Dardanelles is unique in many respects. The very narrow and winding shape of the strait is more akin to that of a river. It is considered one of the most hazardous, crowded, difficult and potentially dangerous waterways in the world. The currents produced by the tidal action in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara are such that ships under sail must await at anchorage for the right conditions before entering the Dardanelles.\n\n==History==\n\nAs part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Dardanelles has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of hostilities in modern history, notably the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the Dardanelles during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].\n\n===Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman, and Byzantine eras (pre-1354)===\n\n====Greek and Persian history====\nThe ancient city of [[Troy]] was located near the western entrance of the strait, and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the [[Trojan War]]. Troy was able to control the marine traffic entering this vital waterway. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes I of Persia]] and later the Macedonian army of [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively.\n\n[[Herodotus]] tells us that, circa 482 BC, Xerxes I (the son of [[Darius the Great|Darius]]) had two [[pontoon bridge]]s built across the width of the Hellespont at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]], in order that his huge army could cross from Persia into [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. This crossing was named by [[Aeschylus]] in his tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' as the cause of divine intervention against Xerxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119043049/http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/persians.html |archivedate=19 November 2003 |df=dmy-all }}; the play.</ref>\n\nAccording to Herodotus (vv.34), both bridges were destroyed by a storm and [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had those responsible for building the bridges beheaded and the strait itself whipped. [[The Histories of Herodotus]] vii.33\u201337 and vii.54\u201358 give details of building and crossing of [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]]. Xerxes is then said to have thrown [[fetters]] into the strait, given it three hundred lashes and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.<ref>Green, Peter ''The Greco-Persian Wars'' (London 1996) 75.</ref>\n\nHerodotus commented that this was a \"highly presumptuous way to address the Hellespont\" but in no way atypical of Xerxes. (vii.35)\n\n[[Harpalus (engineer)|Harpalus the engineer]] eventually helped the invading armies to cross by lashing the ships together with their bows facing the current and, so it is said, two additional anchors.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], the daughter of Athamas, was drowned at the Dardanelles in the legend of the [[Golden Fleece]]. Likewise, the strait was the scene of the legend of [[Hero and Leander]], wherein the lovesick Leander swam the strait nightly in order to tryst with his beloved, the priestess Hero, and was drowned in a storm.\n\n====Byzantine history====\n\nThe Dardanelles were vital to the defence of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.\n\nAlso, the Dardanelles was an important source of income for the ruler of the region. At the [[Istanbul]] Archaeological Museum a marble plate contains a law by the [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I]] (491\u2013518 AD), that regulated fees for passage through the customs office of the Dardanelles. Translation:\n\n<blockquote>... Whoever dares to violate these regulations shall no longer be regarded as a friend, and he shall be punished. Besides, the administrator of the Dardanelles must have the right to receive 50 golden Litrons, so that these rules, which we make out of piety, shall never ever be violated... ... The distinguished governor and major of the capital, who already has both hands full of things to do, has turned to our lofty piety in order to reorganize the entry and exit of all ships through the Dardanelles... ... Starting from our day and also in the future, anybody who wants to pass through the Dardanelles must pay the following: <br />\n\u2013 All wine merchants who bring wine to the capital (Constantinopolis), except [[Cilicia]]ns, have to pay the Dardanelles officials 6 [[follis]] and 2 [[sextarius]] of wine. <br />\n\u2013 In the same manner, all merchants of olive-oil, vegetables and lard must pay the Dardanelles officials 6 follis. Cilician sea-merchants have to pay 3 follis and in addition to that, 1 keration (12 follis) to enter, and 2 keration to exit.<br />\n\u2013 All wheat merchants have to pay the officials 3 follis per modius, and a further sum of 3 follis when leaving.</blockquote>\n\nSince the 14th century the Dardanelles have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.\n\n===Ottoman era (1354\u20131922)===\n\nThe Dardanelles continued to constitute an important waterway under the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire]], starting with the [[Fall of Gallipoli|conquest of Gallipoli]] in 1354.\n\nOttoman control of the strait continued largely without interruption or challenges until the 19th century, when the Empire started [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|its decline]].\n\n====Nineteenth century====\nGaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia\u2014supported by [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Dardanelles Operation]]\u2014[[Battle of the Dardanelles (1807)|blockaded the straits]] in 1807. Following the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828\u201329]], in 1833 Russia pressured the Ottomans to sign the [[Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi]]\u2014which required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. That would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea.\n\nThat treaty alarmed the losers,{{clarify|date=April 2012}}<!--it is unclear who the losers are. The Ottomans?--> who were concerned that the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions could conflict with their own possessions and economic interest in the regions. At the [[London Straits Convention]] in July 1841, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]] pressured Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack the [[Crimean Peninsula]] during the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856) \u2014but this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire. That convention was formally reaffirmed by the [[Congress of Paris]] in 1856, following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War. It remained technically in force into the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n====World War I====\n{{Main article|Occupation of Constantinople|Chanak Crisis}}\n{{Main article|Gallipoli Campaign}}\n\nIn 1915 the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] sent a massive invasion force of British, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, French and Newfoundland troops to attempt to open up the straits. In the [[Gallipoli campaign]], Turkish troops trapped the Allies on the beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula. The campaign did damage to the career of Sir [[Winston Churchill]], then the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who had eagerly promoted the unsuccessful use of [[Royal Navy]] sea power to force open the straits. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], later founder of the [[Republic of Turkey#Republic era|Republic of Turkey]], served as a commander for the Ottomans during the land campaign.\n\nThe Turks mined the straits to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, but in minor actions, two submarines, one British and one Australian, did succeed in penetrating the minefields. The British one sank an obsolete Turkish [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] off the [[Golden Horn]] of Istanbul. [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)|Sir Ian Hamilton]]'s [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] failed in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and its withdrawal was ordered in December 1915, after 8 months' fighting. Total Allied deaths included 43,000 British, 15,000 French, 8,700 Australians, 2,700 New Zealanders, 1,370 Indians and 49 Newfoundlanders. Total Turkish deaths were around 60,000.\n\nFollowing the war, the 1920 [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. The Ottoman Empire's non-ethnically Turkish territories were broken up and partitioned among the Allied Powers, and Turkish jurisdiction over the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] curbed.\n\n===Turkish republican and modern eras (1923\u2013present)===\nAfter the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] following a lengthy campaign by Turks as part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] against both the Allied Powers and the Ottoman court, the [[Republic of Turkey]] was created in 1923 by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], which established most of the modern sovereign territory of Turkey and restored the [[Turkish Straits|straits]] to Turkish territory, with the condition that Turkey keep them demilitarized and allow all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely.\n\nAs part of its national security strategy, Turkey eventually rejected the terms of the treaty, and subsequently remilitarized [[Turkish Straits|the straits]] area over the following decade. Following extensive diplomatic negotiations, the reversion was formalized under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] in July 20, 1936. That convention, which is still in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane while allowing Turkey to retain the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea states.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], through February 1945, when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations. Turkey declared war on Germany in February 1945, but it did not employ any offensive forces during the war.\n\nIn July 1946, the [[Soviet Union]] sent a note to Turkey proposing a new r\u00e9gime for the Dardanelles that would have excluded all nations except the Black Sea powers. The second proposal was that the straits should be put under joint Turkish-Soviet defence. This meant that Turkey, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania would be the only states having access to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles. The Turkish government however, under pressure from the United States, rejected these proposals.<ref>Cabell, Phillips, The Truman presidency : the history of a triumphant succession (New York 1966), 102 - 103.</ref>\n\nTurkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, thus affording its straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.\n\nIn more recent years, the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits.\n\n== Crossings ==\n\n=== Maritime ===\n\nThe waters of the Dardanelles are traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.\n\nThe strait also experiences significant amounts of international commercial shipping traffic by [[Cargo ship|freighters]] and [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]].\n\n=== Land ===\n\nAt present, there are no vehicular crossings across the strait. However, as part of planned expansions to the Turkish National Highway Network, the Turkish Government is considering the construction of [[\u00c7anakkale Suspension Bridge|a suspension bridge]] between [[Sar\u0131\u00e7ay]] (a district of [[\u00c7anakkale Province]]) on the Asian side, to [[Kilitbahir]] on the European side, at the narrowest part of the strait.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bosphorus Technical Consulting Corporation |url=http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |website=www.botek.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106053434/http://www.botek.info/detay_motor_12.html}}</ref> In March 2017, construction of the [[\u00c7anakkale 1915 Bridge]] between the cities of [[Gelibolu]] and [[Lapseki]] started.\n\n=== Subsea ===\n\n2 [[submarine cable]] systems transmitting electric power at 400 kV voltage bridge the Dardanelles to feed west and east of Istanbul.

The Riga area became a key element of settlement and defence of the mouth of the Daugava at least as early as the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the now destroyed fort at [[Tor\u0146akalns]] on the west bank of the Daugava at present day Riga. Since the Late Middle Ages the western part of the Daugava basin has come under the rule of various peoples and states; for example the Latvian town of [[Daugavpils]], located on the western Daugava, variously came under papal rule as well as Slavonic, Polish, German and Russian sway until [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia | restoration of the Latvian independence]] in 1990 at the end of the Cold War.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== Water quality ==\n\nUpstream of the Latvian town of [[Jekabpils]] the pH has a characteristic value of about 7.8; in this reach the calcium ion has a typical concentration of around 43 milligrams per liter; nitrate has a concentration of about 0.82 milligrams per liter (as nitrogen); phosphate ion is measured at 0.038 milligrams per liter; and oxygen saturation was measured at eighty percent. The high nitrate and phosphate load of the Daugava is instrumental to the buildup of extensive phytoplankton biomass in the Baltic Sea; other European rivers contributing to such high nutrient loading of the Baltic are the Oder and Vistula Rivers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn Belarus, water pollution of the Daugava is considered moderately severe, with the chief sources being treated wastewater, fish-farming and agricultural chemical runoff (e.g. herbicides, pesticides, nitrate and phosphate).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=daugava+river#v=onepage&q=daugava%20river&f=false |title=Latvia |author=Richard C.

The heavier trucks, meanwhile, were based on Chevrolet's 1937 design with an engine of [[Graham-Paige]] design. Nissan also built the [[Nissan Patrol|4W60 Patrol]], based on the Willys Jeep, and the 4W70 Carrier, based on the [[Dodge M37]]. Not until January 1955 did Datsun offer a fully indigenous design.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.495\"/>\n\nThat year, the Occupation returned production facilities to Japanese control, and Datsun introduced the [[Nissan Bluebird#110 series|110]] [[Sedan (car)|saloon]] and the 110-based [[Datsun Truck#Datsun 120/220|120]] [[Pickup truck|pickup]].<ref name=\"Daniels, p.495\"/>\n\n===Datsun in the American market===\n[[File:Datsun logo.png|thumb|right|The \"classic\" Datsun logo, based on the [[Flag of Japan]] and Japan's [[Names of Japan|nickname]] as the \"Land of the Rising Sun\". After the Nissan rebrand, the logo remained the same, with \"Datsun\" replaced by \"Nissan\".]]\n\nThe use of the ''Datsun'' name in the American market derives from the name Nissan used for its production cars. In fact, the cars produced by Nissan already used the Datsun brand name, a successful brand in Japan since 1932, long before [[World War II]]. Before the entry into the American market in 1958, Nissan did not produce cars under the Nissan brand name, but only trucks. Their in-house-designed cars were always branded as ''Datsuns''. Hence, for Nissan executives it would be only natural to use such a successful name when exporting models to the United States. Only in the 1960s did Datsun begin to brand some automobile models as ''Nissans'', like the [[Nissan Patrol#Second generation (60; 1959\u20131980)|Patrol]] and a small test batch of about 100 [[Nissan Cedric#First generation 30|Cedric]] sedans,<ref>http://autoweek.com/article/car-life/may-be-oldest-surviving-nissan-north-america</ref> and then not again until the 1980s. The [[Japanese domestic market|Japanese market]] [[Nissan Z-car|Z-car]] (sold as the Fairlady Z) also had Nissan badging. In America, the Nissan branch was named \"''Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A.''\", and chartered on September 28, 1960, in California, but the small cars the firm exported to America were still named Datsun.\n\nCorporate choice favored Datsun, so as to distance the parent factory Nissan\u2019s association by Americans with Japanese military manufacture. In fact Nissan's involvement in Japan's military industries was substantial. The company's car production at the Yokohama plant shifted towards military needs just a few years after the first passenger cars rolled off the assembly line, on April 11, 1935. By 1939 Nissan's operations had moved to [[Manchuria]], then under Japanese occupation, where its founder and President, Yoshisuke Ayukawa, established the Manchurian Motor Company to manufacture military trucks.\n\nAyukawa, a well-connected and aggressive risk taker, also made himself a principal partner of the Japanese Colonial Government of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Halberstam |first=David |title=The Reckoning |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |isbn=9780380721474}}</ref> Ultimately, Nissan Heavy Industries emerged near the end of the war as an important player in Japan\u2019s war machinery. After the war ended, [[Soviet Union]] seized all of Nissan\u2019s Manchuria assets, while the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation Forces]] made use of over half of the [[Yokohama]] plant. [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] had Ayukawa imprisoned for 21 months as a [[war crime|war criminal]]. After release he was forbidden from returning to any corporate or public office until 1951. He was never allowed back into Nissan, which returned to passenger car manufacture in 1947 and to its original name of Nissan Motor Company Ltd. in 1949.\n\n[[File:SPL212.jpg|thumb|right|Datsun Fairlady]]\n\n[[United States armed forces|American service personnel]] in their teens or early twenties during the Second World War would be in prime car-buying age by 1960, if only to find an [[economic system|economical]] small second car for their growing family needs. [[Yutaka Katayama]] (Mr. \"K\"), former president of Nissan's American operations, would have had his personal wartime experiences in mind supporting the name Datsun. Katayama's visit to Nissan\u2019s Manchuria truck factory in 1939 made him realise the appalling conditions of the assembly lines, leading him to abandon the firm.<ref>\u201cYutaka Katayama; A Man Who Realized a Dream in America\", 1998 Z Car Club Association, pg 71.</ref> In 1945, near the end of the war, Katayama was ordered to return to the Manchurian plant, however he rebuffed these calls and refused to return.\n\n[[File:Datsun 240Z.jpg|thumb|Datsun 240Z (US model)]]\n\nKatayama desired to build and sell passenger cars to people, not to the military; for him, the name \"''Datsun''\" had survived the war with its purity intact, not \"''Nissan''\". This obviously led Katayama to have problems with the corporate management. The discouragement felt by Katayama as regards his prospects at Nissan, led to his going on the verge of resigning, when Datsun\u2019s [[Mobil Economy Run|1958 Australian Mobilgas victories]] vaulted him, as leader of the winning Datsun teams, to national prominence in a [[Post-Occupation Japan|Japan bent on regaining international status]].\n\nThe company's first product to be exported around the world was the [[Nissan Bluebird#210/211 series|113]], with a [[Nissan D engine|proprietary]] {{convert|25|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}} {{convert|850|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[four-cylinder engine]].<ref>Daniels, p.496 caption.</ref>\n\nDatsun entered the American market in 1958, with sales in California.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\">Daniels, p.496.</ref> By 1959, the company had dealers across the U.S.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> and began selling the [[Nissan Bluebird#310 series|310]] (known as Bluebird domestically).<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> From 1962 to 1969 the [[Nissan Patrol]] utility vehicle was sold in the United States (as a competitor to the [[Toyota Land Cruiser]] J40 series), making it the only Nissan-badged product sold in the US prior to that name's introduction worldwide decades later.\n\nFrom 1960 on, exports and production continued to grow. A new plant was built at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Oppama]], south of [[Yokohama]]; it opened in 1962. The next year, Bluebird sales first topped 200,000, and exports touched 100,000.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> By 1964, Bluebird was being built at 10,000 cars a month.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/>\n\nFor 1966, Datsun debuted the [[Datsun 1000|1000]], allowing owners of {{convert|360|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[kei car|kei]] cars to move up to something bigger.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> That same year, Datsun won the [[Safari Rally|East African Safari Rally]] and merged with [[Prince Motors]], giving the company the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] model range, as well as a test track at Murayama.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/>\n\nThe company introduced the [[Datsun 510|Bluebird 510]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.496\"/> This was followed in 1968 with the iconic [[Datsun 240Z|240Z]], which proved affordable [[sports car]]s could be built and sold profitably: it was soon the world's #1-selling sports car.<ref>Daniels, pp.496\u2013497.</ref> It relied on an engine based on the Bluebird and used Bluebird suspension components.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.497\">Daniels, p.497.</ref> It would go on to two outright wins in the East African Rally.<ref name=\"Daniels, p.497\"/>\n\nKatayama was made Vice President of the Nissan North American subsidiary in 1960, and as long as he was involved in decision making, both as North American Vice President from 1960 to 1965, and then President of Nissan Motor Company U.S.A. from 1965 to 1975, the cars were sold as Datsuns. \u201cWhat we need to do is improve our car\u2019s [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] gradually and creep up slowly before others notice.

The first [[Europe]]an market that Nissan had entered was [[Finland]], where sales began in 1962. Within a few years, it was importing cars to most of [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.topgear.com/car-news/classic/history-lesson-datsun-name |title=History lesson: the Datsun name |work=Top Gear |location=UK |date=16 July 2013 |access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nDatsun was particularly successful on the British market. It sold just over 6,000 cars there as late as 1971, but its sales surged to more than 30,000 the following year and continued to climb over the next few years, with well-priced products including the [[Datsun Cherry|Cherry 100A]] and [[Datsun Sunny|Sunny 120Y]] proving particularly popular, at a time when the British motor industry was plagued by strikes and [[British Leyland]] in particular was gaining a reputation for building cars which had major issues with build quality and reliability. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Nissan frequently enjoyed the largest market share in Britain of any foreign carmaker.<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/other-cars/unsung-heroes-datsun-120y-sunny-b210/]</ref>\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Nissan badge was gradually appearing on Datsun-badged cars, and eventually the Datsun branding was phased out, the final new car with a Datsun badge being the [[Nissan Micra|Micra]] supermini, launched in Britain from June 1983.<ref>[http://www.aronline.co.uk/blogs/blogs/1983-the-year-of-the-second-generation-supermini/]</ref> By the end of 1984, the Datsun branding had completely disappeared in Britain, although it lingered elsewhere until 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/nissan/ |title=Nissan {{!}} Classic Car Reviews |website=Honest John |access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Rebranding===\n[[File:Nissan-720.jpg|thumb|right|[[Datsun 720]]]]\n\nIn Japan, there appears to have been what probably constituted a long-held 'official' company [[bias]] against use of the name \"Datsun\".<ref>Business Week, 7 April 1973, interview with Katsuji Kawamata, president of Nissan Motor Company Ltd.</ref> At the time, Kawamata was a veteran of Nissan, in the last year of his presidency, a powerful figure whose experience in the firm exceeded two decades. His rise to its leadership position occurred in 1957 in part because of his handling of the critical Nissan workers' strike that began May 25, 1953, and ran for 100 days. During his tenure as President, Kawamata stated that he \"regretted that his company did not imprint its corporate name on cars, the way [[Toyota]] does. 'Looking back, we wish we had started using Nissan on all of our cars,' he says. 'But Datsun was a pet name for the cars when we started [[export]]ing.'\"<ref>Business Week, 7 April 1973, pg. 69.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the decision was made to stop using the brand name ''Datsun'' worldwide, in order to strengthen the company name ''Nissan''.\n\n\"The decision to change the name Datsun to Nissan in the U.S. was announced in the autumn (September/October) of 1981. The rationale was that the name change would help the pursuit of a [[global strategy]]. A single name worldwide would increase the possibility that advertising campaigns, brochures, and promotional materials could be used across countries and simplify product design and manufacturing. Further, potential buyers would be exposed to the name and product when traveling to other countries. Industry observers, however, speculated that the most important motivation was that a name change would help Nissan market stocks and bonds in the U.S. They also presumed substantial [[Human ego|ego]] involvement, since the [[consumer confusion|absence]] of the Nissan name in the U.S. surely rankled Nissan executives who had seen [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] become household words.\"<ref>Aaker, David A. ''Managing Brand Equity : Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name'', New York: The Free Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-02-900101-3}} Chapter 3, Pg. 57</ref>\n\nUltimately, the name change campaign lasted for a three-year period from 1982 to 1984 \u2013 Datsun badged vehicles had been progressively fitted with small \"Nissan\" and \"Datsun by Nissan\" badges from the late 1970s onward until the Nissan name was given prominence in 1983 \u2013 although in some export markets vehicles continued to wear both the Datsun and Nissan badges until 1986.  In the United Kingdom for example, the Nissan name initially was used as a prefix to the model name, with Datsun still being used as the manufacturer's name (e.g. Datsun-Nissan [[Nissan March|Micra]]) from 1982 until 1984.  The name change had cost Nissan a figure in the region of US$500 million. Operational costs included the changing of signs at 1,100 Datsun dealerships, and amounted to US$30 million. Another US$200 million were spent during the 1982 to 1986 advertising campaigns, where the ''\"Datsun, We Are Driven!\"'' campaign (which was adopted in late 1977 in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]] and subsequent [[1979 energy crisis]]) yielded to ''\"The Name is Nissan\"'' campaign. (The latter campaign was used for some years beyond 1985.) Another US$50 million was spent on Datsun advertisements that were paid for but stopped or never used.<ref>[http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm What's in a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508085037/http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm |date=2006-05-08 }} \u2013 ZCCA</ref> Five years after the [[brand equity|name change program]] was over, ''Datsun'' still remained more familiar than ''Nissan''.<ref>Aaker, pg 56.</ref>\n\n===Datsun truck===\n{{Externalimage\n|align=right\n|image1=[http://history.nissan.co.jp/DATSUN/TRUCK/D22/0105/ Image of the 2002 ''Datsun'' pick-up truck]}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] marketed its [[Nissan Frontier|D22]] pick-up model in Japan with the name ''Datsun''.

It was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Geesthacht]], and [[patented]] in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a more powerful alternative to [[gun powder|black powder]]. \n\nToday dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries. Dynamite is still the product of choice for trenching applications, and as a cost-effective alternative to [[cast booster]]s. Dynamite is occasionally used as an initiator or booster for [[ANFO|AN and ANFO explosive charges]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|\"Nobels ExtraDynamit\" manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget]]\n\nDynamite was invented by Swedish chemist [[Alfred Nobel]] in the 1860s and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]], which had been invented in China in the 9th century. Black powder is now popularly known as gunpowder, because while it is effective as a propellant, it is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications. \n\nAlfred Nobel's father, [[Immanuel Nobel]], was an industrialist, engineer, and inventor. He built bridges and buildings in Stockholm and founded Sweden's first rubber factory. His construction work inspired him to research new methods of blasting rock that were more effective than black powder. After some bad business deals in Sweden, in 1838 Immanuel moved [[Nobel family|his family]] to [[Saint Petersburg]], where Alfred and his brothers were educated privately under Swedish and Russian tutors. At age 17, Alfred was [[grand tour|sent abroad for two years]]; in the United States he met Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]] and in France studied under famed chemist [[Th\u00e9ophile-Jules Pelouze]] and his pupil [[Ascanio Sobrero]] who had first synthesized [[nitroglycerin]] in 1847. It was in France that Nobel first encountered nitroglycerin, which Pelouze cautioned against using as a commercial explosive because of its high volatility.<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\">{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel - Dynamit|url=https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/svenska-uppfinnare-och-innovatorer/alfred-nobel-dynamit/|publisher=[[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=1 October 2017|language=sv-SE}}</ref> \n\nIn 1857, Nobel filed the first of several hundred patents, mostly concerning air pressure, gas and fluid gauges, but remained fascinated with nitroglycerin's potential as an explosive. Nobel, along with his father and brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]], experimented with various combinations of nitroglycerin and black powder. Nobel came up with a solution of how to safely detonate nitroglycerin by inventing the [[detonator]], or blasting cap, that allowed a controlled explosion set off from a distance using a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. In the summer of 1863, Nobel performed his first successful detonation of pure nitroglycerin, using a blasting cap made of a copper [[percussion cap]] and [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. In 1864, Alfred Nobel filed patents for both the blasting cap and his method of synthesizing nitroglycerin, which is composed of sulfuric acid, nitric acid and glycerin. On 3 September 1864, while experimenting with nitroglycerin, Emil and several others were killed in an explosion at the factory at Immanuel Nobel's estate at [[Heleneborg]]. After this, Alfred founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in [[Vinterviken]] to continue work in a more isolated area and the following year moved to Germany, where he founded another company, [[Dynamit Nobel]].<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\"/> \n\nDespite the invention of the blasting cap, the volatility of nitroglycerin rendered it useless as a commercial explosive. To solve this problem, Nobel sought to combine it with another substance that would make it safe for transport and handling but yet would not reduce its effectiveness as an explosive. He tried combinations of cement, coal, and sawdust, but was unsuccessful. Finally, he tried [[diatomaceous earth]], fossilized algae, that he brought from the [[Elbe River]] near his factory in [[Hamburg]], which successfully stabilized the nitroglycerin into a portable explosive.<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\"/> \n\nNobel obtained [[patent]]s for his inventions in England on 7 May 1867 and in Sweden on 19 October 1867.<ref name=\"s&s-101\">Sch\u00fcck & Sohlman (1929), p. 101.</ref> After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[black powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.<ref name=\"USPat 234489\">US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880</ref>\n\nNobel originally sold dynamite as \"Nobel's Blasting Powder\" but decided to change the name to dynamite, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''d\u00fdnamis'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2}}), meaning \"power\".<ref>\"dynamite.\" The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2003.

HarperCollins Publishers 19 March 2013 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dynamite</ref>\n\n==Manufacture==\n\n===Composition===\nNitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, but is extremely shock-sensitive (that is, physical shock can cause it to explode), and degrades over time to even more unstable forms, which makes it highly dangerous to transport or use. Dynamite combines nitroglycerin with absorbents and stabilizers, rendering it safe to use while retaining its powerful explosive properties.\n\nNobel's original composition of dynamite consisted of three parts \"explosive oil\" (as [[nitroglycerin]] was called), one part [[diatomaceous earth]] as the absorbent, and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]] antacid as the stabilizer. [[Ethylene glycol dinitrate]] was later added to the nitroglycerin to lower its freezing point and keep it from freezing into a slush at low temperatures, which made it unstable, or from sweating out when it thawed. Diatomaceous earth is not usually used today as an absorbent medium and it has been replaced by cheaper media such as sawdust, wood pulp, flour, or starch. Other stabilizers, such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide, can be used in the place of sodium carbonate. Sodium nitrate is added to the medium as an oxidizer to improve the dynamite's [[brisance]].\n\n===Form===\nDynamite is usually sold in the form of cardboard cylinders about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} long and about {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in diameter, with a weight of about {{convert|1/2|lbt|g|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Austin Blaster Guide\">{{cite web |url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321201205/http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A stick of dynamite thus produced contains roughly 1&nbsp;MJ ([[megajoule]]) of energy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=ChemViews|title=145 Years of Dynamite|url=http://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/3622371/145_Years_of_Dynamite.html|website=Chemistry Views|publisher=ChemViews Magazine|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> Other sizes also exist, rated by either portion (Quarter-Stick or Half-Stick) or by weight.\n\nDynamite is usually rated by \"weight strength\" (the amount of nitroglycerin it contains), usually from 20% to 60%. For example, ''40% dynamite'' is composed of 40% nitroglycerin and 60% \"dope\" (the absorbent storage medium mixed with the stabilizer and any additives).\n\n===Storage considerations===\nThe maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.<ref name=\"Austin Blaster Guide\" />\n\nOver time, regardless of the sorbent used, sticks of dynamite will \"weep\" or \"sweat\" nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage. Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction, and temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using wax coated cardboard.\n\nDynamite is moderately sensitive to shock. Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between 0.5 and 10&nbsp;kg is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.<ref>Carlos L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Emilio L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforaci\u00f3n y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor & Francis, London and New York, 1995, {{ISBN|90-5410-199-7}}</ref> With a hammer of 2&nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n===Major manufacturers===\n[[File:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]\n\n====South Africa====\nFor several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.<ref>[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa - History of the Chemical Industry]</ref>\n\nThere were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nDynamite was first manufactured in the U.S. by the [[Giant Powder Company]] of [[San Francisco, California]] whose founder had obtained the exclusive rights from Nobel in 1867.  Giant was eventually acquired by the [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company]] who subsequently produced it under the Giant name until that company was dissolved by Du Pont in 1905.<ref>[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38234/m1/147/ ''US v. Du Pont'' 188 Fed 127, 147]</ref>\nThereafter, Du Pont produced dynamite under its own name until 1911-12 when its explosives monopoly was broken up by the U.S. Circuit Court in the \"Powder Case\". \nTwo new companies that were formed upon the breakup, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] and the Atlas Powder Company took up the manufacture of dynamite (in different formulations) thereafter.\n\nCurrently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their label on the dynamite and boxes.\n\n==Non-dynamite explosives==\nOther explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:\n\n===TNT===\n[[TNT]] is most commonly assumed to be the same as (or confused for) Dynamite, largely due to the ubiquity of both explosives during the 20th century and the civilian practice of preparing Dynamite charges in 8x1\" \"sticks\" wrapped in red waxed paper and shaped to fit the cylindrical [[borehole]]s drilled in the rock face. This incorrect connection between TNT and Dynamite was enhanced by [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons where animators started labelling ''any'' kind of cartoon bomb (ranging from sticks of Dynamite to kegs of [[black powder]]) as \"TNT\" because the acronym was shorter, more memorable and didn't require [[literacy]] to recognize \"TNT\" meant \"bomb\" (similar to the use of XXX markings on [[whiskey]] bottles and barrels in cartoons). This eventually led to the general perception that TNT and Dynamite were one and the same.\n\nIn actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and Dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation [[Use_forms_of_explosives#Castings|castable explosive]] adopted by the military a full sixty years after Dynamite, which is a 1st generation [[phlegmatized explosive]] primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than Dynamite<ref name=Meyer2008>J. K\u00f6hler, R. Meyer, A. Homburg: ''Explosivstoffe.'' Zehnte, vollst\u00e4ndig \u00fcberarbeitete Auflage. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-32009-7}}.</ref>, as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, Dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: a full generation better than Dynamite, it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a [[blasting cap]] (or a [[sympathetic detonation]]); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at 178 \u00b0F, poured into [[shell (projectile)|high explosive shells]] and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics.<ref>Gibbs, T.R. & Popolato, A. ''LASL Explosive Property Data''. [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], New Mexico. [[USDOE]], 1980.</ref> As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, [[hand grenades]] and [[aerial bombs]] and the remainder being packaged in brown \"bricks\" (not red cylinders) for use as [[satchel charge|demolition charges]] by [[combat engineers]].\n\n===\"Extra\" dynamite===\nIn the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented \"ammonium dynamite\", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.\n\nIt is rated by either \"weight strength\" (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or \"cartridge strength\" (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% \"dope\" (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its \"cartridge strength\" would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.\n\n===\"Military dynamite\"===\n\"Military dynamite\" is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but is much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>  Military dynamite substitutes much more stable chemicals for nitroglycerin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&pg=PA498|year=2007 |isbn=0-615-14794-1}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n{{Main article|Explosive material#Regulation}}\nVarious countries around the world have enacted explosives laws and require licenses to manufacture, distribute, store, use, and possess explosives or ingredients.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Blast fishing]]\n* [[Blasting machine]]\n* [[Dynamite gun]]\n* [[Nobel Prize]]\n* [[Relative effectiveness factor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cartwright, A.

He is best known for his work on founding the field of [[human\u2013computer interaction]], particularly while at his [[Augmentation Research Center]] Lab in [[SRI International]], which resulted in creation of the [[computer mouse]], and the development of [[hypertext]], networked computers, and precursors to [[graphical user interface]]s. These were demonstrated at [[The Mother of All Demos]] in 1968. [[Engelbart's law]], the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.\n\nIn the early 1950s, he decided that instead of \"having a steady job\" \u2013 such as his position at [[Ames Research Center]] \u2013 he would focus on making the world a better place. He reasoned that because the complexity of the world's problems was increasing, and that any effort to improve the world would require the coordination of groups of people, the most effective way to solve problems was to augment human intelligence and develop ways of building collective intelligence.<ref name=\"Interview with Doug Engelbart\">{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM|title=Interview with Doug Engelbart}}</ref> He believed that the computer, which was at the time thought of only as a tool for automation, would be an essential tool for future knowledge workers to solve such problems. He was a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and [[computer network]]s to help cope with the world\u2019s increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed \"bootstrapping\". His belief was that when human systems and tool systems were aligned, such that workers spent time \"improving their tools for improving their tools\" it would lead to an accelerating rate of progress.\n\nUnder Engelbart's guidance, the Augmentation Research Center developed, with funding primarily from [[DARPA]], the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] to demonstrate numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; this included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at \"The Mother of All Demos\" in 1968. The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment. At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986.\n\nIn 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute \u2013 later known as [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]] \u2013 to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment. In December 2000, [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the U.S.'s highest technology award. In December 2008, Engelbart was honored by SRI at the 40th anniversary of the \"Mother of All Demos\".\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEngelbart was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], on January 30, 1925, to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson Engelbart. His ancestors were of [[Germans|German]], [[Swedes|Swedish]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] descent.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|last=Lowood|first=Henry|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/main1-ntb.html|title=Douglas Engelbart Interview 1, Stanford and the Silicon Valley: Oral History Interviews]|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=1986-12-19|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>\n\nHe was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (three years older), and a brother David (14 months younger). The family lived in Portland, Oregon, in his early years, and moved to the surrounding countryside along Johnson Creek when he was 8. His father died one year later.

He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display \"working stations\", flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools.<ref name=\"aughum\">{{cite web|title=Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|first=Douglas C|last = Engelbart |work=SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223, Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research|publisher=SRI International, hosted by [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |date=October 1962|accessdate= 2013-08-11}}</ref>\n\nAs a graduate student at Berkeley, he assisted in the construction of [[CALDIC]].

He worked for [[Hewitt Crane]] on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics; Engelbart and Crane became close friends.<ref>{{cite book|title=What the Dormouse Said|author=Markoff, John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTyfxP-g2IIC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|page=70|isbn=1-101-20108-8}}</ref> At SRI, Engelbart soon obtained a dozen patents,<ref name=\"The Doug Engelbart Institute\"/> and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed research agenda titled ''Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework''.<ref name=\"aughum\" /> Among other highlights, this paper introduced \"[[Building Information Modelling]]\", which architectural and engineering practice eventually adopted (first as \"[[parametric design]]\") in the 1990s and after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/11436/BIM-101-What-is-Building-Information-Modeling.aspx|title=What is Building Information Modeling|publisher=[[Engineering.com]]|accessdate=2017-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThis led to funding from [[DARPA]] to launch his work. Engelbart recruited a research team in his new [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI). Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed \"[[bootstrapping]] strategy\". He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/bootstrapping-strategy.html|title=About an Accelerative Bootstrapping Strategy|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref><ref name=\"scopus\">{{Scopus|id=6701716173}}</ref><ref name=\"dblp\">{{DBLP|name=Douglas C. Engelbart}}</ref><ref name=\"microsoft\">{{AcademicSearch|1367057}}</ref>\n\nThe ARC became the driving force behind the design and development of the [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as [[bitmap]]ped screens, the mouse, [[hypertext]], collaborative tools, and precursors to the [[graphical user interface]].<ref name=\"acm\">{{ACMPortal|id=81100342853}}</ref> He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see [[batch processing]]), and when software tended to be written for [[vertical application]]s in proprietary systems.\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg| thumb|Two [[Macintosh Plus|Apple Macintosh Plus]] mice, 1986]]\n\nEngelbart applied for a [[patent]] in 1967 and received it in 1970, for the wooden shell with two metal wheels ([[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]] \u2013 {{US patent |3541541}}), which he had developed with [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], his lead engineer sometime before 1965.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914 Computer-aided Display Control] English & Englebart, July 1965</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1633972.stm|title=Mouse inventor strives for more|first=Alfred|last=Hermida|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2001-11-05|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> In the patent application it is described as an \"X-Y position indicator for a display system\". Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the \"mouse\" because the tail came out the end.

As early as 1970, several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for [[Xerox PARC]], in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing.<ref name=\"ACMTuring1997\" /> Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, [[timesharing|timeshare]] (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.<ref name=\"ACMTuring1997\" /><ref name=OBrien1999 />\n\nBeginning in 1972, several key ARC personnel were involved in [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST), with Engelbart ultimately serving on the corporation's board of directors for many years. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community.<ref name=\"bard\" /> The 1969 [[Mike Mansfield#Mansfield Amendments|Mansfield Amendment]], which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the [[Vietnam War]], and the end of the [[Apollo program]] gradually reduced ARC's funding from DARPA and [[NASA]] throughout the early 1970s.\n\nSRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of [[artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Bertram Raphael]], who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called [[Tymshare]] in 1976. Engelbart's house in [[Atherton, California]] burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff (including its creator as a Senior Scientist), renamed the software ''Augment'', and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.<ref name=OBrien1999 />\n\nAt Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself further marginalized. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to conduct ongoing research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at [[McDonnell Douglas]], which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html|title=About An Open Hyperdocument System (OHS)|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.<ref name=\"ACMTuring1997\" /><ref name=OBrien1999 />\n\n=== Bootstrap and the Doug Engelbart Institute ===\nTeaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, he founded the Bootstrap Institute in 1988 to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University from 1989 to 2000.<ref name=OBrien1999 /> By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the [[The Doug Engelbart Institute|Bootstrap Alliance]] was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort.

At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and pressure]] it is [[metastability|metastable]] and [[graphite]] is the [[Chemical stability|stable]] form, but diamond almost never converts to graphite. Diamond is renowned for its superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong [[covalent bond]]ing between its atoms. In particular, it has the highest [[Scratch hardness|hardness]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material. Those properties determine the major industrial applications of diamond in cutting and polishing tools and the scientific applications in [[diamond knife|diamond knives]] and [[diamond anvil cell]]s.\n\nBecause of its extremely rigid lattice, diamond can be contaminated by very few types of impurities, such as [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]]. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown ([[lattice defect]]s), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high [[optical dispersion]] (ability to disperse light of different colors).\n\nMost natural diamonds have ages between 1&nbsp;billion and 3.5&nbsp;billion years. Most were formed at depths of {{convert|150|to|250|sp=us|km}} in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], although a few have come from as deep as {{convert|800|sp=us|km}}. Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds. Much more recently (tens to hundreds of million years ago), they were carried to the surface in [[volcanic eruptions]] and deposited in [[igneous rock]]s known as [[kimberlite]]s and [[lamproite]]s.\n\n[[Synthetic diamond]]s can be grown from high-purity carbon under high pressures and temperatures or from [[hydrocarbon]] gas by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). [[Diamond simulant|Imitation diamonds]] with similar [[Gemology|gemological]] properties can also be made out of materials such as [[cubic zirconia]] and [[silicon carbide]].

Coal is formed from buried prehistoric plants, and most diamonds that have been dated are far older than the first [[Embryophyte|land plants]].

Instead of kimberlite, the host rock is [[lamproite]]. Lamproites with diamonds that are not economically viable are also found in the United States, India and Australia.<ref name=Shirey2013/> In addition,  diamonds in the [[Algoman orogeny|Wawa belt]] of the Superior province in [[Canada]] and microdiamonds in the [[Northeastern Japan arc|island arc of Japan]] are found in a type of rock called [[lamprophyre]].<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\nKimberlites can be found in narrow (1&ndash;4 meters) dikes and sills, and in pipes with diameters that range from about 75 meters to 1.5 kilometers. Fresh rock is dark bluish green to greenish gray, but after exposure rapidly turns brown and crumbles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kjarsgaard|first1=B.

They are a mixture of [[xenocryst]]s and [[xenolith]]s (minerals and rocks carried up from the lower crust and mantle), pieces of surface rock, altered minerals such as [[Serpentine subgroup|serpentine]], and new minerals that crystallized during the eruption. The texture varies with depth. The composition forms a continuum with [[carbonatite]]s, but the latter have too much oxygen for carbon to exist in a pure form. Instead, it is locked up in the mineral [[calcite]] ([[calcium|Ca]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\nAll three of the diamond-bearing rocks (kimberlite, lamproite and lamprophyre) lack certain minerals ([[melilite]] and [[kalsilite]]) that are incompatible with diamond formation. In kimberlite, [[olivine]] is large and conspicuous, while lamproite has Ti-[[phlogopite]] and lamprophyre has [[biotite]] and [[amphibole]]. They are all derived from magma types that erupt rapidly from small amounts of melt, are rich in [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] and [[magnesium oxide]], and are less [[redox|oxidizing]] than more common mantle melts such as [[basalt]]. These characteristics allow the melts to carry diamonds to the surface before they dissolve.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===Exploration===\n[[File:Diavik Mine.tif|thumb|upright|Diavik Mine, on an island in Lac de Gras in northern Canada.]]\nKimberlite pipes can be difficult to find. They weather quickly (within a few years after exposure) and tend to have lower topographic relief than surrounding rock. If they are visible in outcrops, the diamonds are never visible because they are so rare. In any case, kimberlites are often covered with vegetation, sediments, soils or lakes. In modern searches, [[geophysical survey|geophysical methods]] such as [[aeromagnetic survey]]s, [[Electrical resistivity tomography|electrical resistivity]] and [[gravimetry]], help identify promising regions to explore. This is aided by isotopic dating and modeling of the geological history. Then surveyors must go to the area and collect samples, looking for kimberlite fragments or ''indicator minerals''. The latter have compositions that reflect the conditions where diamonds form, such as extreme melt depletion or high pressures in [[eclogite]]s. However, indicator minerals can be misleading; a better approach is [[geothermobarometry]], where the compositions of minerals are analyzed as if they were in equilibrium with mantle minerals.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\nFinding kimberlites requires persistence, and only a small fraction contain diamonds that are commercially viable. The only major discoveries since about 1980 have been in Canada. Since existing mines have lifetimes of as little as 25 years, there could be a shortage of new diamonds in the future.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===Ages===\nDiamonds are dated by analyzing inclusions using the decay of radioactive isotopes. Depending on the elemental abundances, one can look at the decay of [[Rubidium\u2013strontium dating|rubidium to strontium]], [[Samarium\u2013neodymium dating|samarium to neodymium]], [[Uranium\u2013lead dating|uranium to lead]], [[Argon\u2013argon dating|argon-40 to argon-39]], or [[Rhenium\u2013osmium dating|rhenium to osmium]]. Those found in kimberlites have ages ranging from 1 to 3.5 billion years, and there can be multiple ages in the same kimberlite, indicating multiple episodes of diamond formation. The kimberlites themselves are much younger. Most of them have ages between tens of millions and 300 million years old, although there are some older exceptions (Argyle, [[Premier Mine|Premier]] and Wawa). Thus, the kimberlites formed independently of the diamonds and served only to transport them to the surface.<ref name=Cartigny/><ref name=Shirey2013/> Kimberlites are also much younger than the cratons they have erupted through. The reason for the lack of older kimberlites is unknown, but it suggests there was some change in mantle chemistry or tectonics. No kimberlite has erupted in human history.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===Origin in mantle===\n[[File:Eclogite, d\u00e9tail de la roche.jpg|thumb|Eclogite with centimeter-size garnet crystals.]]\nMost gem-quality diamonds come from depths of 150 to 250 kilometers in the lithosphere. Such depths occur below cratons in ''mantle keels'', the thickest part of the lithosphere. These regions have high enough pressure and temperature to allow diamonds to form and they are not convecting, so diamonds can be stored for billions of years until a kimberlite eruption samples them.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\nHost rocks in a mantle keel include [[harzburgite]] and [[lherzolite]], two type of [[peridotite]]. The most dominant rock type in the upper mantle, peridotite is an [[igneous rock]] consisting mostly of the minerals [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]; it is low in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] and high in [[magnesium]]. However, diamonds in peridotite rarely survive the trip to the surface.<ref name=Shirey2013/> Another common source that does keep diamonds intact is [[eclogite]], a [[metamorphic]] rock that typically forms from [[basalt]] as an oceanic plate plunges into the mantle at a [[Subduction|subduction zone]].<ref name=Cartigny/>\n\nA smaller fraction of diamonds (about 150 have been studied) come from depths of 330&ndash;660 kilometers, a region that includes the [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]]. They formed in eclogite but are distinguished from diamonds of shallower origin by inclusions of [[majorite]] (a form of [[garnet]] with excess silicon). A similar proportion of diamonds comes from the lower mantle at depths between 660 and 800 kilometers.<ref name=Cartigny/>\n\nDiamond is thermodynamically stable at high pressures and temperatures, with the phase transition from [[graphite]] occurring at greater temperatures as the pressure increases. Thus, underneath continents it becomes stable at temperatures of 950 degrees Celsius and pressures of 4.5 gigapascals, corresponding to depths of 150 kilometers or greater. In subduction zones, which are colder, it becomes stable at temperatures of 800 degrees C and pressures of 3.5 gigapascals. At depths greater than 240 km, iron-nickel metal phases are present and carbon is likely to be either dissolved in them or in the form of [[carbide]]s. Thus, the deeper origin of some diamonds may reflect unusual growth environments.<ref name=Cartigny/><ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\nIn 2018 the first known natural samples of a phase of ice called [[Ice VII]] were found as inclusions in diamond samples. The inclusions formed at depths between 400 and 800 kilometers, straddling the upper and lower mantle, and provide evidence for water-rich fluid at these depths.<ref name=Cartier>{{cite journal|last1=Cartier|first1=Kimberly|title=Diamond Impurities Reveal Water Deep Within the Mantle|journal=Eos|date=2 April 2018|volume=99|doi=10.1029/2018EO095949}}</ref><ref name=Perkins>{{cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=Sid|title=Pockets of water may lie deep below Earth\u2019s surface|journal=Science|date=8 March 2018|doi=10.1126/science.aat5630}}</ref>\n\n===Carbon sources===\nThe amount of carbon in the mantle is not well constrained, but its concentration is estimated at 0.5 to 1 parts per thousand.<ref name=Shirey2013/> It has two [[Stable nuclide|stable isotopes]], [[Carbon-12|<sup>12</sup>C]] and [[Carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]], in a ratio of approximately 99:1 by mass. This ratio has a wide range in meteorites, which implies that it was probably also broad in the early Earth. It can also be altered by surface processes like [[photosynthesis]]. The fraction is generally compared to a standard sample using a ratio [[Isotopic signature#Carbon isotopes|\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C]] expressed in parts per thousand. Common rocks from the mantle such as basalts, carbonatites and kimberlites have ratios between -8 and -2. On the surface, organic sediments have an average of -25 while carbonates have an average of 0.<ref name=Cartigny/>\n\nPopulations of diamonds from different sources have distributions of \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C that vary markedly. Peridotitic diamonds are mostly within the typical mantle range; eclogitic diamonds have values from -40 to +3, although the peak of the distribution is in the mantle range. This variability implies that they are not formed from carbon that is ''primordial'' (having resided in the mantle since the Earth formed). Instead, they are the result of tectonic processes, although (given the ages of diamonds) not necessarily the same tectonic processes that act in the present.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===Formation and growth===\nDiamonds in the mantle form through a ''[[metasomatism|metasomatic]]'' process where a C-O-H-N-S fluid or melt dissolves minerals in a rock and replaces them with new minerals. (The vague term C-O-H-N-S is commonly used because the exact composition is not known.) Diamonds form from this fluid either by reduction of oxidized carbon (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>3</sub>) or oxidation of a reduced phase such as [[methane]].<ref name=Cartigny/>\n\nUsing probes such as polarized light, [[photoluminescence]] and [[cathodoluminescence]], a series of growth zones can be identified in diamonds. The characteristic pattern in diamonds from the lithosphere involves a nearly concentric series of zones with very thin oscillations in luminescence and alternating episodes where the carbon is resorbed by the fluid and then grown again. Diamonds from below the lithosphere have a more irregular, almost polycrystalline texture, reflecting the higher temperatures and pressures as well as the transport of the diamonds by convection.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===Transport to the surface===\n[[File:VolcanicPipe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of a volcanic pipe]]\nGeological evidence supports a model in which kimberlite magma rose at 4&ndash;20 meters per second, creating an upward path by [[hydraulic fracturing]] of the rock. As the pressure decreases, a vapor phase [[exsolution|exsolves]] from the magma, and this helps to keep the magma fluid. At the surface, the initial eruption explodes out through fissures at high speeds (over 200 meters per second). Then, at lower pressures, the rock is eroded, forming a pipe and producing fragmented rock ([[breccia]]). As the eruption wanes, there is [[pyroclastic]] phase and then metamorphism and hydration produces [[serpentinite]]s.<ref name=Shirey2013/>\n\n===In space===\n{{Main|Extraterrestrial diamonds}}\nAlthough diamonds on [[Earth]] are rare, they are very common in space. In [[meteorite]]s, about 3 percent of the carbon is in the form of [[nanodiamond]]s, having diameters of a few nanometers. Sufficiently small diamonds can form in the cold of space because their lower [[surface energy]] makes them more stable than graphite. The isotopic signatures of some nanodiamonds indicate they were formed outside the Solar System in stars.<ref name=Tielens>{{cite journal |last1=Tielens |first1=A. G. G.

Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching\u2014perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in [[engagement ring|engagement]] or [[wedding ring]]s, which are often worn every day.\n\n[[File:Vickers anvil diamons.jpg|thumb|The extreme hardness of diamond in certain orientations makes it useful in materials science, as in this pyramidal diamond embedded in the working surface of a [[Vickers hardness test]]er.]]\n\nThe hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from the [[Copeton Dam|Copeton]] and [[Bingara]] fields located in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] area in [[New South Wales]], Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness is associated with the [[crystal growth]] form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness.

Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine the weight of the final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%.<ref name=x50>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=jPT6JADCqgwC&pg=PA280 | page = 280 | title = Handbook of carbon, graphite, diamond, and fullerenes: properties, processing, and applications | last = Pierson | first = Hugh O. | publisher = William Andrew | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8155-1339-9 }}</ref> Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations.

It needs to address a large number of issues, bears much responsibility, and therefore can last years in case of unique diamonds. The following issues are considered:\n*The hardness of diamond and its ability to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. Therefore, the crystallographic structure of the diamond to be cut is analyzed using [[X-ray diffraction]] to choose the optimal cutting directions.\n*Most diamonds contain visible non-diamond inclusions and crystal flaws. The cutter has to decide which flaws are to be removed by the cutting and which could be kept.\n*The diamond can be split by a single, well calculated blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, it can be cut with a [[diamond saw]], which is a more reliable but tedious procedure.<ref name=antique/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=X3qe9jzYUAQC&pg=PA984 | pages = 984\u2013992 | title = Handbook of industrial diamonds and diamond films|last1 = Prelas | first1 = Mark Antonio | last2 = Popovici | first2 = Galina | last3 = Bigelow | first3 = Louis K. | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-8247-9994-1 }}</ref>\n\nAfter initial cutting, the diamond is shaped in numerous stages of polishing.

One such substance is [[diamond-like carbon]]\u2014an amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties similar to those of the diamond.

This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2\u20133 seconds.<ref>{{cite patent | inventor1-first = J.

Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).\n\n==Stolen diamonds==\nOccasionally large thefts of diamonds take place. In February 2013 armed robbers carried out a [[Brussels Airport diamond heist|raid at Brussels Airport]] and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (\u00a332m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo hold of a Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22447516 | work=BBC News | title=Arrests over $50m Belgium airport diamond heist | date=May 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe identification of stolen diamonds presents a set of difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river\u2014alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than those that have been mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.\n\nThe [[Kimberley Process]] was developed to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated by the government of the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.\n\nDiamonds may be etched by laser with marks invisible to the naked eye. [[Lazare Kaplan International|Lazare Kaplan]], a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21525403 | work=BBC News | title=Who, What, Why: How do you spot a stolen diamond? | date=February 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21504112 | work=BBC News | title=Brussels diamond robbery nets 'gigantic' haul | date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Gemology and Jewelry}}\n* [[Diamondoid]]\n* [[List of diamonds]]\n** [[List of largest rough diamonds]]\n* [[List of minerals]]\n* [[Lonsdaleite]]\n* [[Superhard material]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Books==\n* {{cite book |author=C.

He found fame with the influential [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]] with [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]], [[MC Ren]], and [[DJ Yella]], which popularized explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut ''[[The Chronic]]'', released under Death Row Records, made him one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993, and earned him a [[Grammy Award]] for the single \"[[Let Me Ride]]\". That year, he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Dogg's quadruple platinum debut ''[[Doggystyle]]'', and mentored producers such as his step-brother [[Warren G]] (leading to the multi-platinum debut ''[[Regulate...G Funk Era]]'' in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's cousin [[Daz Dillinger]] (leading to the double-platinum debut ''[[Dogg Food]]'' by [[Tha Dogg Pound]] in 1995).\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album, ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]],'' in 1996, and released a solo album, ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]],'' in 1999. During the 2000s, Dr. Dre focused on producing other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. Dr. Dre signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, and co-produced their albums. He has won six [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]]. Dr.&nbsp;Dre has had acting roles in movies such as ''[[Set It Off (film)|Set It Off]]'', ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'' and ''[[Training Day]]''. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Dre 56 on their list of \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\n\n== Early life ==\nYoung was born in [[Compton, California]], the first child of Theodore and Verna Young.

In the start of his career as a producer for the [[World Class Wreckin Cru]] with DJ Alonzo Williams in the mid-1980s, his beats were in the [[electro-hop]] style pioneered by [[The Unknown DJ]], and that of early hip-hop groups like the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Whodini]]. These influences are evident in [[Eazy-E]]'s 1986 song \"[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]],\" which Dre produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/23193/Eazy-E-Boyz-N-The-Hood-Original-Concept-Pump-That-Bass/|title=Eazy-E's Boyz-N-The-Hood sample of Original Concept's Pump That Bass \u2013 WhoSampled|work=WhoSampled}}</ref> Sampling was at the time a key element of Dre's production, the [[E-mu SP-1200]] being his primary instrument in the N.W.A days.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Dre sampled the [[Ohio Players]]' [[ARP Pro Soloist|ARP]] synth riffs from their 1973 funk hit \"[[Funky Worm]]\" in the N.W.A song \"Dopeman\". Being the first hip-hop producer to sample the song,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/Ohio-Players/Funky-Worm/|title=Funky Worm|work=WhoSampled}}</ref> Dre both paved the way for the future popularization of the [[G-funk]] style within hip-hop, and established heavy synthesizer solos as an integral part of his production style. Dr. Dre was also one of the very first producers to interpolate the then little-known [[Amen break|drum break]] from [[The Winstons]]' \"[[Amen, Brother]]\" in the N.W.A song \"[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]\". This break has since bec\u03bfme a staple in not only hip-hop, but all popular music, having been used in over 1700 songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/|title=Amen, Brother|work=WhoSampled}}</ref>\n\nFrom ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' on, Dre uses live musicians to replay old melodies rather than sampling them. With [[Ruthless Records]], collaborators included guitarist Mike \"Crazy Neck\" Sims, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, [[DJ Yella]] and sound engineer Donovan \"The Dirt Biker\" Sound. Dre is receptive of new ideas from other producers, one example being his fruitful collaboration with [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]'s producer [[Cold 187um]] while at Ruthless. Cold 187&nbsp;um was at the time experimenting with 1970s [[P-Funk]] samples ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] etc.), that Dre also utilized. Dre has since been accused of \"stealing\" the concept of [[G-funk]] from Cold 187&nbsp;um.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/12/01/on-the-record-and-above-the-law-with-cold187um/|title=AllHipHop \"  On the Record and Above the Law With Cold187um|work=AllHipHop}}</ref>\n\nUpon leaving Ruthless and forming [[Death Row Records]] in 1991, Dre called on veteran West Coast DJ [[Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor]] and sound engineer Greg \"Gregski\" Royal, along with Colin Wolfe, to help him on future projects. His 1992 album ''[[The Chronic]]'' is thought to be one of the most well-produced hip-hop albums of all time.<ref name=RapCentral>[http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/drdreLyricsCHRON.html Dr. Dre The Chronic Album Info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408060315/http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/drdreLyricsCHRON.html |date=April 8, 2014 }}.

In songs such as \"Murder was the Case\" and \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", the synthesizer pitch is higher and the drum tempo is slowed down to 91 BPM<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audiokeychain.com/track/PUM/snoop-dogg-murder-was-the-case|title=Key and BPM of Snoop Dogg \u2013 Murder Was The Case \u2013 AudioKeychain|work=AudioKeychain}}</ref> (87 BPM in the remix) to create a dark and gritty atmosphere. [[Percussion]] instruments, particularly [[sleigh bells]], are also present. Dre's frequent collaborators from this period included [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] natives Stuart \"Stu-B-Doo\" Bullard, a multi-instrumentalist from the Ozanam Strings Orchestra,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/the-men-behind-the-man-ii-part-2-stu-b-doo/|title=The Men Behind The Man (ii): Part 2: Stu-B-Doo|work=H World}}</ref> [[Sam Sneed]], Stephen \"[[Bud'da]]\" Anderson,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://harlemworld.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-men-behind-the-man-part-1-budda-no-homo/|title=The men behind the man.

The beat for the [[Houston]]-based group [[Geto Boys]] 1996 song \"Still\" follows the same drum pattern as \"Natural Born Killaz\" and Eazy E's \"Wut Would U Do\" (a diss to Dre) is similar to the original \"Murder was the Case\" instrumental. This style of production is usually accompanied by [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[occult]]-themed lyrics and imagery, being crucial to the creation of [[horrorcore]].\n\nBy 1996, Dre was again looking to innovate his sound. He recruited keyboardist Camara Kambon to play the keys on \"[[Been There, Done That]]\", and through Bud'da and Sam Sneed he was introduced to fellow Pittsburgh native Melvin \"[[Mel-Man]]\" Bradford. At this time, he also switched from using the E-mu SP-1200 to the Akai MPC3000 drum kit and sampler, which he still uses today. Beginning with his 1996 compilation [[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]], Dre's production has taken a less sample-based approach, with loud, layered [[snare drum]]s dominating the mix, while synthesizers are still omnipresent. In his critically acclaimed second album, [[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]], live instrumentation takes the place of sampling, a famous example being \"[[The Next Episode]]\", in which keyboardist Camara Kambon re-played live the main melody from [[David McCallum]]'s 1967 jazz-funk work \"The Edge\". For every song on ''2001'', Dre had a [[keyboardist]], [[guitarist]] and [[bassist]] create the basic parts of the beat, while he himself programmed the [[drums]], did the [[music sequencer|sequencing]] and [[overdubbing]] and added sound effects, and later mixed the songs. During this period, Dre's signature \"west coast whistle\" riffs are still present albeit in a lower pitch, as in \"Light Speed\", \"Housewife\", \"Some L.A. Niggaz\" and Eminem's \"[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]\" hook. The sound of \"2001\" had tremendous influence on hip-hop production, redefining the West Coast's sound and expanding the G-funk of the early 1990s. To produce the album, Dre and Mel-Man relied on the talents of [[Scott Storch]] and Camara Kambon on the keys, [[Mike Elizondo]] and Colin Wolfe on bass guitar, Sean Cruse on lead guitar and sound engineers Richard \"Segal\" Huredia and Mauricio \"Veto\" Iragorri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dr-Dre-2001/release/226393 |title=Dr. Dre - 2001 (CD, Album) |publisher=Discogs.com |date=November 16, 1999 |accessdate=November 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-2000s, Dr. Dre has taken on a more soulful production style, using more of a classical piano instead of a keyboard, and having [[clapping|claps]] replace snares, as evidenced in songs such as Snoop Dogg's \"Imagine\" and \"[[Boss' Life]]\", [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"Get You Some\" and \"Been Through the Storm\", [[Stat Quo]]'s \"Get Low\" and \"The Way It Be\", Jay-Z's \"[[Lost One]]\", Nas' \"Hustlers\", and several beats on Eminem's Relapse album. Soul and R&B pianist [[Mark Batson]], having previously worked with [[The Dave Matthews Band]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] and [[Maroon 5]] has been credited as the architect of this sound. Besides Batson, Aftermath producer and understudy of Dre's, [[Dawaun Parker]], who has named [[Q-Tip]] and [[J Dilla]] as his primary influences, is thought to be responsible for giving Dre's newest beats an East Coast feel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2kmusic.com/fr/topic/interview-de-dawaun-parker/31490|title=Interview de Dawaun Parker|work=2KMUSIC.COM}}</ref>\n\n===Production equipment===\nDr.&nbsp;Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the [[Music Production Center|Akai MPC3000]], a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s [[funk]] musicians such as [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.<ref name=\"scratch 2004\">{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Interview|url=http://www.dr-dre.com/info/interview_scratch_dr_dre.php|work=[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]|date=May 2004|accessdate=December 6, 2006}}</ref> In 2001 he told ''Time'' magazine, \"I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it.

To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.&nbsp;Dre.

The NPS has since closed the loophole by disallowing climbs on any named arch within the park year-round. [[Slacklining]] and the placement of new fixed anchors on new climbs is also prohibited. Controversy erupted when photographs taken after Potter's climb appeared to show damage caused by a climbing technique called [[top roping]]. Potter stated on several occasions that he never top-roped the arch, and no photos exist of Potter using a top rope setup on the arch.

He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema ''Une nouvelle source de l'histoire'' (eng. A New Source of History) and ''La photographie anim\u00e9e'' (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in [[French language|French]] and among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film.<ref>Scott MacKenzie, Film Manifestos and Global Cinema Cultures: A Critical Anthology, Univ of California Press 2014, {{ISBN|9780520957411}}, p.520</ref> Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers  to propose the creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.<ref>James Chapman, \"Film and History.

Australian National University Press</ref>\n\nGrierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the \"original\" actor and \"original\" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials \"thus taken from the raw\" can be more real than the acted article.

It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-1900===\n\nEarly film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called \"actuality\" films; the term \"documentary\" was not coined until 1926.  Many of the first films, such as those made by [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations.\n\nFilms showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]''. Using pioneering film-looping technology, [[Enoch J. Rector]] presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.\n\nIn May 1896, [[Boles\u0142aw Matuszewski]] recorded on film few surigical operations in [[Warsaw]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon [[Eug\u00e8ne-Louis Doyen]] invited Boles\u0142aw Matuszewski and [[Cl\u00e9ment Maurice]] and proposed them to recorded his surigical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898.<ref>Charles Ford, Robert Hammond: Polish Film: A Twentieth Century History. McFarland, 2005. {{ISBN|9781476608037}}, p.10.</ref> Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series ''Extirpation des tumeurs encapsul\u00e9es'' (1906), and the four-film ''Les Op\u00e9rations sur la cavit\u00e9 cr\u00e2nienne'' (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.<ref>{{cite journal|title = \u201cIl faut voir le ma\u00eetre\u201d: A Recent Restoration of Surgical Films by E.-L.

[[Path\u00e9]] is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is [[Moscow clad in snow]] (1909).\n\nBiographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature ''[[Eminescu-Veronica-Creang\u0103]]'' (1914) on the relationship between the writers [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Veronica Micle]] and [[Ion Creang\u0103]] (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the [[Bucharest]] chapter of [[Path\u00e9]].\n\nEarly color motion picture processes such as [[Kinemacolor]]\u2014known for the feature ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (1912)\u2014and [[Prizma]]color\u2014known for ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and the five-reel feature ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921)\u2014used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, [[Technicolor]] concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.\n\nAlso during this period, [[Frank Hurley]]'s feature documentary film, ''South'' (1919), about the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1914.\n\n===1920s===\n\n====Romanticism====\n[[File:Nanook of the north.jpg|thumb|''[[Nanook of the North]]'' poster.]]\nWith [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' in 1922, documentary film embraced [[romanticism]]; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in ''Nanook of the North'', Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless [[igloo]] for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's ''Nanook'' and ''Moana'' with two romanticized documentaries, ''[[Grass (1925 film)|Grass]]'' (1925) and ''[[Chang (film)|Chang]]'' (1927), both directed by [[Merian Cooper]] and [[Ernest Schoedsack]].\n\n====The city symphony====\nCity Symphony Films were avant-garde films made during the 1920s to 1930s. These films were particularly influenced by modern art: namely Cubism, Constructivism, and Impressionism. (See A.L Rees, 2011)<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Experimental Film and Video (2nd Edition)|last = Rees|first = A.L.|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-84457-436-0|location = |pages = }}</ref> According to Scott Macdonald (2010), city symphony film can be located as an intersection between documentary and avant-garde film: \"avant-doc\". However, A.L. Rees suggest to see them as avant-garde films. (Rees, 2011: 35)\n\nCity Symphony films include ''[[Manhatta]]'' (dir. Paul Strand, 1921), ''[[Rien que les heures|Paris Nothing but the Hours]]'' (dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926), ''Twenty Four Dollar Island'' (dir. Robert Flaherty, 1927), ''\u00c9tudes sur Paris'' (dir. Andr\u00e9 Sauvage, 1928), ''The Bridge'' (1928), and ''[[Joris Ivens|Rain]]'' (1929), both by Joris Ivens.\n\nBut the most famous city symphony films are ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis|Berlin, Symphony of a Great City]]'' (dir. Walter Ruttman, 1927) and ''[[Man with a Movie Camera|The Man with a Movie Camera]]'' (dir. Dziga Vertov, 1929).\n[[File:Berlin Ruttmann.png|thumb|In this shot from Walter Ruttmann's ''Berlin, Symphony of a Great City'' (1927), cyclists race indoors. The film is shot and edited like a visual-poem.\n]]\nA City Symphony Film, as the name suggests, is usually based around a major metropolitan city area and seek to capture the lives, events and activities of the city. It can be abstract and cinematographic (see Walter Ruttmann's ''Berlin'') or utilise Russian Montage theory (See Dziga Vertov's ''Man with a Movie Camera''). But most importantly, a city symphony film is like a cine-poem and is shot and edited like a \"symphony\".  [[File:Mikhail kaufman on train.jpg|thumb|In this shot from ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'', [[Mikhail Kaufman]] acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot]]\nThe continental, or realist, tradition focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called \"city symphony\" films such as [[Walter Ruttmann]]'s ''[[Berlin, Symphony of a City]]'' (of which Grierson noted in an article<ref>Grierson, John. 'First Principles of Documentary', in Kevin Macdonald & Mark Cousins (eds.) Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary. London: Faber and Faber, 1996</ref> that ''Berlin'' represented what a documentary should '''not''' be), [[Alberto Cavalcanti]]'s ''[[Rien que les heures]]'', and [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''. These films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean towards the avant-garde.\n\n====''Kino-Pravda''====\n[[Dziga Vertov]] was central to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''[[Kino-Pravda]]'' (literally, \"cinematic truth\") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera\u2014with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion\u2014could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.\n\n====Newsreel tradition====\nThe [[newsreel]] tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.\n\n===1920s\u20131940s===\nThe propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial [[propaganda film]]s is [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), which chronicled the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Congress]] and was commissioned by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Leftist filmmakers [[Joris Ivens]] and [[Henri Storck]] directed ''[[Borinage]]'' (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] directed a \"[[surrealism|surrealist]]\" documentary ''[[Land Without Bread|Las Hurdes]]'' (1933).\n\n[[Pare Lorentz]]'s ''[[The Plow That Broke the Plains]]'' (1936) and ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' (1938) and [[Willard Van Dyke]]'s ''[[The City (1939 film)|The City]]'' (1939) are notable [[New Deal]] productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' (1942\u20131944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. [[Constance Bennett]] and her husband [[Henri de la Falaise]] produced two feature-length documentaries, ''[[Legong: Dance of the Virgins]]'' (1935) filmed in [[Bali]], and ''Kilou the Killer Tiger'' (1936) filmed in [[Indochina]].\n\nIn Canada, the [[National Film Board of Canada|Film Board]], set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of [[Nazi]] Germany (orchestrated by [[Joseph Goebbels]]).\n\n[[File:Basil Wright, Joris Ivens, Elmar Klos i Jerzy Toeplitz - Film nr 55-56 - 1948-12-23.JPG|thumb|Conference of \"World Union of documentary films\" in 1948 Warsaw featured famous directors of the era: [[Basil Wright]] (on the left), [[Elmar Klos]], [[Joris Ivens]] (2nd from the right), and [[Jerzy Toeplitz]].]]\nIn Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the [[Documentary Film Movement]]. Grierson, [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Harry Watt (director)|Harry Watt]], [[Basil Wright]], and [[Humphrey Jennings]] amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include ''Drifters'' ([[John Grierson]]), ''[[Song of Ceylon]]'' ([[Basil Wright]]), ''[[Fires Were Started]]'', and ''[[A Diary for Timothy]]'' ([[Humphrey Jennings]]). Their work involved poets such as [[W. H. Auden]], composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]], and writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]]. Among the best known films of the movement are ''[[Night Mail]]'' and ''[[Coal Face]]''.\n\nFilm ''Calling mr. Smith'' (1943) was anti-nazi color film<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|title=Calling Mr. Smith - LUX|author=|date=|website=lux.org.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234317/https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|title=Calling Mr Smith - Centre Pompidou|author=|date=|website=centrepompidou.fr|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024033/https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|archivedate=31 January 2018|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|title=Franciszka and Stefan Themerson: Calling Mr. Smith (1943) - artincinema|author=|date=21 June 2015|website=artincinema.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024247/http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|archivedate=31 January 2018|df=}}</ref> created by [[Stefan Themerson]] and being both documentary and avant-garde film against war. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history.\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\n\n====Cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9====\n[[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] (or the closely related [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]]) was dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.\n\nCin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the [[French New Wave]], the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.\n\nAlthough the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ([[Jean Rouch]]) and the North American \"[[Direct Cinema]]\" (or more accurately \"[[:fr:Cin\u00e9ma direct|Cin\u00e9ma direct]]\"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians [[Allan King]], [[:fr:Michel Brault|Michel Brault]], and [[Pierre Perrault]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and Americans [[Robert Drew]], [[Richard Leacock]], [[Frederick Wiseman]], and [[Albert and David Maysles]].\n\nThe directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.\n\nThe films ''[[Chronicle of a Summer]]'' ([[Jean Rouch]]), ''[[Dont Look Back]]'' ([[D. A. Pennebaker]]), ''[[Grey Gardens]]'' ([[Albert and David Maysles]]), ''[[Titicut Follies]]'' ([[Frederick Wiseman]]), ''[[Primary (film)|Primary]]'' and ''[[Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment]]'' (both produced by [[Robert Drew]]), ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (directed by [[Barbara Kopple]]), ''[[Lonely Boy (film)|Lonely Boy]]'' ([[Wolf Koenig]] and [[Roman Kroitor]]) are all frequently deemed [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] films.\n\nThe fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the [[shooting ratio]] (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement\u2014such as [[Werner Nold]], Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, [[Susan Froemke]], and Ellen Hovde\u2014are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.\n\nFamous cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9/direct cinema films include ''[[Les Raquetteurs]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url = http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/our-collection/?idfilm=54008 |title = Les raquetteurs |website =National Film Board of Canada|date = 15 August 2017}}</ref> ''Showman'', ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]'', ''Near Death'', and ''The Children Were Watching''.\n\n====Political weapons====\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against [[neocolonialism]] and [[capitalism]] in general, especially in [[Latin America]], but also in a changing [[Quebec]] society. ''La Hora de los hornos'' (''[[The Hour of the Furnaces]]'', from 1968), directed by [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr.]], influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was \"Chile: A Special Report,\" public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the [[Salvador Allende]] government in [[Chile]] by military leaders under [[Augusto Pinochet]], produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and Jos\u00e9 Garcia.\n\n===Modern documentaries===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:VoicesOfIraq.jpg|thumb|One of 150 DV cameras used by Iraqis to film themselves and create the 2004  film ''[[Voices of Iraq]]''.]] -->\n[[Box office]] analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[Food, Inc.]]'', ''[[Earth (2009 film)|Earth]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Religulous]]'', and ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.\n\nThe nature of documentary films has expanded in the past 20 years from the cinema verit\u00e9 style introduced in the 1960s in which the use of portable camera and sound equipment allowed an intimate relationship between filmmaker and subject. The line blurs between documentary and narrative and some works are very personal, such as the late [[Marlon Riggs]]'s ''Tongues Untied'' (1989) and ''Black Is...Black Ain't'' (1995), which mix expressive, poetic, and rhetorical elements and stresses subjectivities rather than historical materials.<ref>Struggles for Representation African American Documentary Film and Video, edited by Phyllis R. Klotman and Janet K. Cutler,</ref>\n\nHistorical documentaries, such as the landmark 14-hour ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]: America's Civil Rights Years'' (1986\u2014Part 1 and 1989\u2014Part 2) by Henry Hampton, ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997) by [[Spike Lee]], and ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' by [[Ken Burns]], UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery [[500 Years Later]], expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' by [[Errol Morris]] incorporated stylized re-enactments, and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger & Me]]'' placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as \"[[mondo films]]\" or \"docu-ganda.\"<ref name=\"csm\">{{cite news\n |first       = Daniel B.\n |last        = Wood\n |url         = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0602/p01s02-ussc.html\n |title       = In 'docu-ganda' films, balance is not the objective\n |publisher   = [[Christian Science Monitor]]\n |date        = 2 June 2006\n |accessdate  = 2006-06-06\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060612211916/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0602/p01s02-ussc.html\n |archivedate = 12 June 2006\n |df          = \n}}</ref> However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.\n\nDocumentary filmmakers are increasingly utilizing social impact campaigns with their films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/afi-docs-fueling-social-change-1201524000/|title=AFI Docs: Filmmakers Get Savvier About Fueling Social Change|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=2015-06-19|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604032728/http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/afi-docs-fueling-social-change-1201524000/|archivedate=2016-06-04|df=}}</ref> Social impact campaigns seek to leverage media projects by converting public awareness of social issues and causes into engagement and action, largely by offering the audience a way to get involved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azuremedia.org/azuremedia.org/social_impact_campaigns.html|title=social impact campaigns|website=www.azuremedia.org|access-date=2016-06-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331001043/http://www.azuremedia.org/azuremedia.org/social_impact_campaigns.html|archivedate=2016-03-31|df=}}</ref> Examples of such documentaries include ''[[Kony 2012]]'', ''[[Salam Neighbor]], [[Gasland]]'', ''[[Living on One Dollar]]'', and ''[[Girl Rising]]''.\n\nAlthough documentaries are financially more viable with the increasing popularity of the genre and the advent of the [[DVD]], funding for documentary film production remains elusive. Within the past decade, the largest exhibition opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters who have become their largest funding source.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070519040840/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/fes_01Sund_010208_Docs.html indiewire.com], \"Festivals: Post-Sundance 2001; Docs Still Face Financing and Distribution Challenges.\" February 8, 2001.</ref>\n\nModern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the development of \"[[reality television]]\" that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The ''making-of'' documentary shows how a [[Film|movie]] or a [[video game|computer game]] was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an advertisement than a classic documentary.\n\nModern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change was [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', where 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to Iraqis to record themselves.\n\n====Documentaries without words====\nFilms in the documentary form without words have been made. From 1982, the [[Qatsi trilogy]] and the similar ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' could be described as visual tone poems, with music related to the images, but no spoken content. ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' (part of the Qatsi trilogy) consists primarily of [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse photography]] of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. ''Baraka'' tries to capture the great pulse of humanity as it flocks and swarms in daily activity and religious ceremonies.\n\n''[[Bodysong]]'' was made in 2003 and won a British Independent Film Award for \"Best British Documentary.\"\n\nThe 2004 film ''[[Genesis (2004 film)|Genesis]]'' shows animal and plant life in states of expansion, decay, sex, and death, with some, but little, narration.\n\n====Narration styles====\n; Voice-over narrator\nThe traditional style for narration is to have a dedicated narrator read a script which is dubbed onto the audio track.   The narrator never appears on camera and may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject matter or involvement in the writing of the script.\n; Silent narration\nThis style of narration uses title screens to visually narrate the documentary.  The screens are held for about 5\u201310 seconds to allow adequate time for the viewer to read them.  They are similar to the ones shown at the end of movies based on true stories, but they are shown throughout, typically between scenes.\n; Hosted narrator\nIn this style, there is a host who appears on camera, conducts interviews, and who also does voice-overs.\n\n==Other forms==\n\n===Docufiction===\n[[Docufiction]] is a [[Wiktionary:hybrid|hybrid]] [[genre]] from two basic ones, [[fictional film|fiction film]] and [[documentary]], practiced since the first documentary films were made.\n\n=== Fake-fiction ===\n{{See also|Pseudo-documentary#Film}}\nFake-fiction is a genre which deliberately presents real, unscripted events in the form of a fiction film, making them appear as staged. The concept was introduced<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/11/where-is-rocky-ii-ed-ruscha-mojave-desert-film-pierre-bismuth|title=Where is Rocky II?

[[Film release|theatrical release]]) and subsequently on DVD for public consumption.\n\nThis form of documentary release is becoming more popular and accepted as costs and difficulty with finding TV or theatrical release slots increases.  It is also commonly used for more 'specialist' documentaries, which might not have general interest to a wider TV audience.  Examples are military, cultural arts, transport, sports, etc..\n\n===Compilation films===\nCompilation films were pioneered in 1927 by [[Esfir Shub|Esfir Schub]] with ''The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty''. More recent examples include ''[[Point of Order (film)|Point of Order]]'' (1964), directed by [[Emile de Antonio]] about the McCarthy hearings. Similarly, ''[[The Last Cigarette]]'' combines the testimony of various [[tobacco]] company executives before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.\n\nPoetic documentaries, which first appeared in the 1920s, were a sort of reaction against both the content and the rapidly crystallizing grammar of the early fiction film. The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters\u2014\"lifelike people\"\u2014were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and space\u2014a coherence favored by the fiction films of the day\u2014can also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The \"real world\"\u2014Nichols calls it the \"historical world\"\u2014was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens' ''Rain'' (1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]]'s ''Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)'', in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; [[Oskar Fischinger]]'s abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's ''[[N.Y., N.Y. (film)|N.Y., N.Y.]]'' (1957), a city symphony film; and [[Chris Marker]]'s ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' (1982).\n\nExpository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds 'objective' and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and 'objective' account and interpretation of past events.\n\nExamples: TV shows and films like ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', many science and nature documentaries, [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[The Civil War (miniseries)|The Civil War]]'' (1990), [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]' ''[[The Shock of the New]]'' (1980), [[John Berger]]'s ''[[Ways Of Seeing]]'' (1974), [[Frank Capra]]'s wartime ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series, and [[Pare Lorentz]]'s ''[[The Plow That Broke The Plains]]'' (1936).\n\n===Observational===\n[[File:Creating documentary 01.jpg|thumb|film team at [[Port of Dar es Salaam]] with two ferries]] \nObservational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lighweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.\n\n===Types===\n\n'''Participatory documentaries''' believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by their presence. Nichols: \"The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)\" The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the \"truth\" refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.\n\n'''Reflexive documentaries''' do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead, they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to \"question the authenticity of documentary in general.\" It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of 'realism'. It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to 'defamiliarize' what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.\n\n'''Performative documentaries''' stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's ''Tongues Untied'' (1989) or Jenny Livingston's ''Paris Is Burning'' (1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to 'speak about themselves.' Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.\n\n==Translation==\n\nThere are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries. The main two are working conditions and problems with terminology.\n\n===Working conditions===\n\nDocumentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary, translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 110-111.</ref>\n\nAnother problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by \"the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names\".<ref name=\"Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120\">Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 111</ref> When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessarily difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: \"Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen, and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley\".<ref name=\"Matamala, A. 2009 pp. 109-120\"/>\n\n===Terminology===\n\nThe process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field. Therefore, they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe documentary ''Beetles, Record Breakers'' makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devil\u2019s coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120). Bristol, UK: Multilingual Matters, p. 113-114</ref> Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case, they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real life situations.<ref>Matamala, A. (2009). Main Challenges in the Translation of Documentaries. In J. Cintas (Ed.), New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (pp. 109-120).

It is the sequel to the 1987 game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''. The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle\u2014a sentient, disembodied tentacle\u2014from taking over the world. The player takes control of the trio and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.\n\n[[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]] and [[Tim Schafer]] co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited number of elements from ''Maniac Mansion'' and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included [[Chuck Jones]] cartoons and the [[history of the United States]]. ''Day of the Tentacle'' is the eighth LucasArts title to use the [[SCUMM]] engine.\n\nThe game was released simultaneously on [[floppy disk]] and [[CD-ROM]] to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements. ''Day of the Tentacle'' has featured regularly in lists of \"top\" games published more than two decades after its release, and aspects have been referenced in popular culture. A remaster of ''Day of the Tentacle'' was developed by Schafer's current studio, [[Double Fine Productions]], and released on March 22, 2016, for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[OS X]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Day of the Tentacle'' follows the [[point-and-click]] two-dimensional [[adventure game]] formula, first established by the original ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''. Players direct the controllable characters around the game world by clicking with the [[computer mouse]]. To interact with the game world, players choose from a set of nine commands arrayed on the screen (such as \"pick up\", \"use\", or \"talk to\") and then on an object in the world. This was the last [[SCUMM]] game to use the original interface of having the bottom of the screen being taken up by a verb selection and inventory; starting with the next game to use the [[SCUMM]] engine, ''[[Sam & Max Hit the Road]]'', the engine was modified to scroll through a more concise list of verbs with the right mouse button and having the inventory on a separate screen.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro-2\">{{cite journal |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |title=Hall of Fame: Guybrush Threepwood |year=2010 |issue=3 |pages=188\u2013189 |series=The Ultimate Retro Companion |issn=1448-2606 |oclc=173412381}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Sam & Max Hit the Road |journal=[[GamesTM]] |series=Retro Micro Games Action |volume=1 |pages=128\u2013129 |publisher=Highbury Entertainment |issn=1448-2606 |oclc=173412381}}</ref>\n\n''Day of the Tentacle'' uses [[time travel]] extensively; early in the game, the three main protagonists are separated across time by the effects of a faulty [[Time travel|time machine]]. The player, after completing certain puzzles, can then freely switch between these characters, interacting with the game's world in the separate time periods. Certain small inventory items can be shared by placing the item into the \"Chron-o-Johns\", modified [[portable toilet]]s that instantly transport objects to the other time period, while other items are shared by simply leaving the item in a past time period to be picked up by a character in a future period. Changes made to a past time period will affect a future one, and many of the game's puzzles are based on the effect of time travel, aging of certain items, and alterations of the time stream. For example, one puzzle requires the player, while in the future era where Purple Tentacle has succeeded, to send a [[medical chart]] of a Tentacle back to the past, having it used as the design of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], then collecting one such flag in the future to be used as a Tentacle disguise to allow that character to roam freely.<ref name=\"digitialspy retro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/levelup/a245962/retro-corner-day-of-the-tentacle-pc.html |title=Retro Corner: 'Day Of The Tentacle' (PC) |first=Mark |last=Langshaw |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724152822/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/levelup/a245962/retro-corner-day-of-the-tentacle-pc.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe whole original ''Maniac Mansion'' game can be played on a computer resembling a [[Commodore 64]] inside the ''Day of the Tentacle'' game; this practice has since been repeated by other game developers, but at the time of ''Day of the Tentacle's'' release, it was unprecedented.<ref name=\"GSGG\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041124031943/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archivedate=November 24, 2004 |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: The Only Good Tentacle Is a Green Tentacle |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nFive years after the events of ''Maniac Mansion'', Purple Tentacle\u2014a mutant monster and lab assistant created by [[mad scientist]] Dr. Fred Edison\u2014drinks toxic sludge from a river behind Dr. Fred's laboratory.

The four discussed what time periods to focus on, settling on the Revolutionary War and the future. The Revolutionary War offered opportunities to craft many puzzles around that period, such as changing the Constitution to affect the future. Grossman noted the appeal of the need to make wide-sweeping changes such as the Constitution just to achieve a small personal goal, believing this captured the essence of adventure games.<ref name=\"usgamer design\"/> The future period allowed them to explore the nature of cause and effect without any historical bounds.<ref name=\"usgamer design\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/day-of-the-tentacle-the-oral-history |title=Day of the Tentacle: The Oral History |first=Bob |last=Mackey |date=March 7, 2016 |accessdate=March 7, 2016 |work=[[USgamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309215914/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/day-of-the-tentacle-the-oral-history |archivedate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> Grossman and Schafer decided to carry over previous characters that they felt were the most entertaining.

They first discussed the character personalities, which Larry Ahern used to create concept art. Ahern wanted to make sure that the art style was consistent and the character designs were established early, in contrast to what had happened with ''Monkey Island 2'', in which various artists came in later to help fill in necessary art assets as necessary, creating a disjointed style.<ref name=\"usgamer art\"/> [[Looney Tunes]] animation shorts, particularly the [[Chuck Jones]]-directed ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'', ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'' and ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century]]'' inspired the artistic design. The cartoonish style also lent itself to providing larger visible faces to enable more expressive characters.<ref name=\"usgamer art\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/behind-the-art-of-day-of-the-tentacle |title=Behind the Art of Day of the Tentacle |first=Bob |last=Mackey |date=March 7, 2016 |accessdate=March 7, 2016 |work=[[USgamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309214035/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/behind-the-art-of-day-of-the-tentacle |archivedate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> [[Peter Chan (artist)|Peter Chan]] designed backgrounds, spending around two days to progress from concept sketch to final art for each background.<ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/> Chan too used [[Looney Tunes]] as influence for the backgrounds, trying to emulate the style of Jones and [[Maurice Noble]]. Ahern and Chan went back and forth with character and background art to make sure both styles worked together without too much distraction. They further had Jones visit their studio during development to provide input into their developing art.<ref name=\"usgamer art\"/> The choice of art style inspired further ideas from the designers. Grossman cited cartoons featuring [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], and commented that the gag involving a painted white stripe on [[Penelope Pussycat]] inspired a puzzle in the game.  The artists spent a year creating the in-game animations.<ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/>\n\nThe script was written in the evening, when fewer people were in the office.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/><ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/> Grossman considered it the easiest aspect of production, but encountered difficulties when writing with others around.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/>\n\n{{quote box|quoted=true|width=35%|salign=center|quote=With a time travel story, I leave a bottle of wine somewhere, and it causes a bottle of vinegar to appear in the same place four hundred years later.

I will say that it was really fun to think about the effects of large amounts of time on things like wine bottles and sweaters in dryers, and to imagine how altering fundamentals of history like the Constitution and the flag could be used to accomplish petty, selfish goals like the acquisition of a vacuum and a tentacle costume. We definitely enjoyed ourselves designing that game.|source=Dave Grossman on designing the game's puzzles<ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/>}}\n\nGrossman and Schafer brainstormed regularly to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated with members of the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/> The staff conceived puzzles involving the [[History of the United States (1776\u20131789)|U.S.'s early history]] based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences.<ref name=\"usgamer design\"/><ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/> To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took [[Artistic license|creative license]] towards facts to fit them into the game's design.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/><ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/>\n\n''Day of the Tentacle'' features a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only last for a few minutes, but with ''Tentacle'', the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players.<ref name=\"usgamer art\"/> They assigned [[Kyle Balda]], an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds to aid in the animation.<ref name=\"usgamer art\"/> Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.<ref name=\"usgamer art\"/>\n\n=== Technology and audio ===\n''Day of the Tentacle'' uses the [[SCUMM]] engine developed for ''Maniac Mansion''.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/> LucasArts had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For example, the number of input verbs was reduced and items in the character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro-2\"/> While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine. Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/>\n\nThe title was the first LucasArts adventure game to incorporate voice work on release.{{efn|''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'' predates ''Day of the Tentacle'' by a month, but did not have voice work until a enhanced version released a year later in 1993.}} The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low.<ref name=\"usgamer design\"/> As they neared the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not be done in time by the end of the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.<ref name=\"usgamer design\"/>\n\nVoice director Tamlynn Barra managed that aspect of the game.<ref name=\"usgamer design\"/>   Schafer and Grossman described how they imagined the characters' voices and Barra sought audition tapes of voice actors to meet the criteria. She presented the best auditions to the pair. Schafer's sister Ginny was among the auditions, and she was chosen for Nurse Edna. Schafer opted out of the decision for her selection to avoid [[nepotism]].<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/> Grossman and Schafer encountered difficulty selecting a voice for Bernard.<ref name=\"GamesTm-Retro\"/><ref name=\"RetroMaking\"/> To aid the process, Grossman commented that the character should sound like [[Les Nessman]] from the television show ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.

The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version.

A poem entitled \"A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining\" written by Adams in January 1970, at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014.<ref>Flood, Alison (March 2014).

He wanted to join the [[Footlights]], an invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent. He was not elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called \"Adams-Smith-Adams\", and became a member of the Footlights by 1973.<ref name=\"Simpson_30-40\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|pp=30\u201340}}</ref> Despite doing very little work\u2014he recalled having completed three essays in three years\u2014he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in [[English literature]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Writing===\nAfter leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being discovered by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#6. Party Political Broadcast|episode 45]] of ''Monty Python'' for a sketch called \"[[Patient Abuse]]\". The pair also co-wrote the \"Marilyn Monroe\" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of ''[[The Album of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the Film of Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being [[Neil Innes]]).<ref name=times>{{cite news|title=Terry Jones remembers Douglas Adams, 'the last of the Pythons'|newspaper=The Times|date=10 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb]]\n\nAdams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. At the beginning of episode 42, \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#Pepperpots|pepper-pot]] outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling for scrap metal (\"Any old iron...\"). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6150254.stm |title='Lost' gems from the TV archives |last=Young |first=Kevin |date=1 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=9 May 2018 |language=en-GB |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt this point Adams's career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy.<ref name=ODNB /> To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 93.</ref>\n\nDuring this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed ''Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to live with his mother.<ref name=ODNB /> The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; \"I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [..] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather.

After the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'']] became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a pantomime called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''.<ref>Roberts, Jem.

Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could be used in the series.\n[[File:Towelday-Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Towel Day]] 2005 in Innsbruck, Austria, where Adams first had the idea of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide''. In the novels a towel is the most useful thing a space traveller can have. The annual Towel Day (25 May) was first celebrated in 2001, two weeks after Adams's death.]]\n\nAccording to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'', and it occurred to him that \"somebody ought to write a ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''\". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), Additional Material by M.

He turned to [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.<ref>Webb 2005a, p. 120.</ref> Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.\n\n[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by [[National Public Radio]]. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21\u201325 January 1980.\n\nWhile working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' was completed.<ref>Felch 2004</ref> He was quoted as saying, \"I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\"<ref name=Simpson_236>{{Harvnb|Simpson|2003|p=236}}</ref> Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992.\n\nThe books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four ''Hitchhiker's'' novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback edition).<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].</ref>\n\nIn 1980 Adams began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a film, making several trips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/|title=''The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy''|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with [[Disney]], which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting film]] was released in 2005.\n\nRadio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|isbn=0-330-43510-8 |pages=xiv | nopp=true}}</ref> They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book \"trilogy\". As with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, \"more upbeat\" ending) concluded with, \"The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author.\"<ref>Adams, ''Dirk Maggs'', Page 356.</ref>\n\n====''Dirk Gently'' series====\n[[File:Douglas Adams San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Adams in March 2000]]\nBetween Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was published in 1987, and was described by its author as \"a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics\".<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | page=169 | isbn=1-84023-742-2}}</ref> It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had written.\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' After the book tour, Adams set off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.\n\n====''Doctor Who''====\n{{Main|Doctor Who}}\nAdams sent the script for the ''HHGG'' pilot radio programme to the ''Doctor Who'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called \"Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen\", which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979.

[[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[BBC Online|BBC website]] in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on 10 December 2005.\n\nIn the ''Doctor Who'' 2012 Christmas episode ''[[The Snowmen#Production|The Snowmen]]'', writer [[Steven Moffat]] was inspired by a storyline that Adams pitched called ''The Doctor Retires''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moffat |first=Steven |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-12-24/doctor-who-christmas-special-steven-moffat-matt-smith-and-jenna-louise-coleman-reveal-all |title=Doctor Who Christmas special: Steven Moffat, Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman reveal all |work=Radio Times |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nAdams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first guitar in 1964).

In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!\" to demonstrate his view that the [[fine-tuned Universe]] argument for God was a fallacy.<ref>Adams 1998.</ref>\n\nHe remained fascinated by religion because of its effect on human affairs. \"I love to keep poking and prodding at it.

This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[kakapo]] and [[Chinese river dolphin|baiji]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name.

Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. The major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene, until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.<ref name=\"bmg.com\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum & Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}</ref> Drum and bass remains most popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] although it has developed scenes all around the world, in countries such as the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand, Greece, Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Australia.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Oldschool jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to a new electronic music style in the [[rave]] scene, which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. A faster subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognised as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum and bass that prior to jungle, the music was getting faster and more experimental. Professional DJ and producer C.K. states, \"There was a progression as far as the speed of music is concerned. Anyone buying vinyl every week from 1989 to 1992 noticed this.\"\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n|accessdate = 1 June 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a [[intelligent drum and bass|lighter and often jazz-influenced style]] of drum and bass gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997) which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. But towards the turn of the millennium its popularity was deemed to have dwindled as the [[UK garage]] style known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. London DJ/producer C.K. says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid 90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\" Despite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]]<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], and Australia's [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep through to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref

2013}}\n\nDrum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night

One of his more famous basslines (Reese \u2013 \"Just Want Another Chance\", Incognito Records, 1988) was indeed sampled on Renegade's ''Terrorist'' and countless others since, being known simply as the 'Reese' bassline.

There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, produced 1980\u20131984, had a bass drum sound which became very important in Drum and bass.]]\nOf equal importance is the TR-808 kick drum, an artificially pitch-downed or elongated [[bass drum]] sound sampled from Roland's classic [[TR-808]] drum machine, and a sound which has been subject to an enormous amount of experimentation over the years.<ref name=\"TR-808\">{{Cite web| url = http://www.synthmuseum.com/roland/roltr80801.html | title = TR-808| accessdate = 24 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]], is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\"/>\n\nThe Amen break was synonymous with early drum and bass productions but other samples have had a significant impact, including the [[Apache (single)|Apache]], [[Funky Drummer]], \"Soul Pride\", \"Scorpio\" and \"[[Think (About It)]]\" breaks.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1062&ReviewID=1684&PageNumber=1| title = Forever And Ever Amen article on knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309101109/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?SectionID=1031&uid=&MagID=1062&ReviewID=1684&PageNumber=1| archivedate = 9 March 2007| df = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.junglebreaks.co.uk/breaks.html | title = The Breaks | website = Jungle Breaks | accessdate = 15 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany drum and bass tracks have featured more than one sampled breakbeat in them and a technique of switching between two breaks after each bar developed. Examples of this can be heard on mid-90s releases such as [[J Majik]]'s \"Your Sound\". A more recent commonly used break is the Tramen, which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/61H1Xopkz?url=http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 28 August 2011| df = }}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm | title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150s and 160s), but the mid-170 tempo is still the hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass but a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007| df = }}</ref>\n\n===Context===\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG||thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The mix CD is a particularly popular form of release, with a big name DJ/producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\nMany mixing points begin or end with the \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and \"[[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]\". Sometimes the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, though as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point, though some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" by spinning the record back and restarting it at the build. \"The drop\" is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drumbreaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to dance.\n\nAlthough it has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n|accessdate = 1 June 2014\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs and some events are specifically marketed as being MC free.

Notable venues and events include The Hive and Beat It at Flex held almost every Thursday and Saturday, Vollkontakt at Fluc, Switch at Flex and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label-Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nThe Czech Republic currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered Slovakia, and local producers in both countries like A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, etc. becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, LET IT ROLL Winter Slovakia in the colder months. During the club season, it goes without saying that promoters are racing between each other to organise better events, often resulting in 10 parties being held during one weekend with no more than 2 hour travel between them.\n\n===Genres influenced by drum and bass===\nBorn around the same time as jungle, [[breakcore]] and [[digital hardcore]] share many of the elements of drum and bass and to the uninitiated, tracks from the extreme end of drum and bass may sound identical to breakcore thanks to speed, complexity, impact and maximum sonic density combined with musical experimentation. German Drum and Bass DJ [[The Panacea]] is also one of the leading Digital Hardcore artists. [[Raggacore]] resembles a faster version of the ragga influenced jungle music of the 1990s, similar to breakcore but with more friendly [[dancehall]] beats (dancehall itself being a very important influence on drum and bass).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm |title=Raggacore article on lfodemon.com |accessdate=6 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217064746/http://www.lfodemon.com/raggacorearticle/index.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> [[Darkcore]], a direct influence on drum and bass, was combined with influences of drum and bass itself leading to the creation of [[darkstep]]. There is considerable crossover from the extreme edges of drum and bass, breakcore, darkcore, digital hardcore and raggacore with fluid boundaries.\n\nThe genre has influenced many other genres like [[hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]], with artists such as [[Bill Laswell]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]], [[Linkin Park]], [[The Roots]], [[Talvin Singh]], [[MIDIval Punditz]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[The Freestylers]], [[Bowery Electric]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[David Bowie]] (the last two both using elements of Goldie's \"Timeless\"){{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} and others quoting drum and bass and using drum and bass techniques and elements.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n===Distributors (wholesale)===\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031 | title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban Music Limited ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and MixCloud have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[Podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nThe three highest profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London. Fabio and Grooverider previously held a long-standing drum and bass show on Radio 1, and there was also Radio 1's 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>) as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of Drum and Bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only Drum and Bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal license), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax Fm and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n====Internet radio====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], [[DJ Marky]], Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|url=http://kmag.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|website=K Mag}}</ref>\n\n====North American Radio====\nIn North America, The Prophecy on 89.5 [[CIUT-FM]] With Marcus Visionary, DJ Prime and Mr. Brown Is North America's longest running Jungle Radio show{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (Toronto), Album 88.5 (Atlanta) and [[KNHC|C89.5fm]] (Seattle) have shows showcasing drum and bass.

He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the [[Big O notation|asymptotic notation]]. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of [[theoretical computer science]], Knuth is the creator of the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, the related [[METAFONT]] font definition language and rendering system, and the [[Computer Modern]] family of typefaces.\n\nAs a writer and scholar, Knuth created the [[WEB]] and [[CWEB]] computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate [[literate programming]], and designed the [[MIX]]/[[MMIX]] [[instruction set|instruction set architectures]]. Knuth strongly opposes granting [[software patent]]s, having expressed his opinion to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nKnuth was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], to German-Americans Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/571/000023502/ |title=Donald E.

Although the judges only had 2,500 words on their list, Donald found 4,500 words, winning the contest. As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.<ref>{{Cite book |year=1998 |title=Out of their minds: the lives and discoveries of 15 great computer scientists |first1=Dennis Elliott |last1=Shasha |first2=Cathy A |last2=Lazere |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98269-4 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-0tDZX3z-8UC&pg=PA90}}</ref><ref name=\"Raskin2013\"/>\n\n===Education===\n\nIn 1956, Knuth received\u00a0a scholarship\u00a0to the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] (now part of [[Case Western Reserve University]]) in Cleveland, Ohio. He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the [[Theta Chi fraternity]]. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the [[IBM 650]], one of the early [[mainframe computer|mainframes]]. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.<ref name=\"Koshy2004\">{{Cite book |first=Thomas |last=Koshy |title=Discrete mathematics with applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90KApidK5NwC&pg=PA244 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |year=2004 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-421180-3 |page=244}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win their games.

While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html |title=The Art of Computer Programming |publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>\n\nJust before publishing the first volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the [[Institute for Defense Analyses#Center for Communications and Computing|Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division]], then situated on the [[Princeton University]] campus, which was performing mathematical research in [[cryptography]] to support the [[National Security Agency]].\n\nKnuth then left this position to join the [[Stanford University]] faculty, where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus.<ref name=\"homepage\">{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/ |title=Home page |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=2005-03-16}}</ref><ref>https://profiles.stanford.edu/donald-knuth</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nKnuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/vita.html |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=Curriculum vitae |publisher=Stanford University}}</ref> Knuth has been called the \"father of the [[analysis of algorithms]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Karp |first=Richard M. |authorlink=Richard M.

Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research.\n\nIn 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book ''A=B'' by [[Marko Petkov\u0161ek]], [[Herbert Wilf]] and [[Doron Zeilberger]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/DEK.html |title=DEK |last=Zeilberg |publisher=Rutgers}}</ref> Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to ''[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]]''.\n\nKnuth has also delved into [[recreational mathematics]].  He contributed articles to the ''[[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]]'' beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in [[Joseph Madachy]]'s ''Mathematics on Vacation''.<ref>Madachy, Joseph S.,''Mathematics on Vacation'', Thomas Nelson & Sons Ltd. 1966</ref>\n\nKnuth has also appeared in a number of [[Numberphile]]<ref>http://www.numberphile.com/team/index.html</ref> and Computerphile videos on [[YouTube]] where he has discussed topics from writing Surreal Numbers to why he doesn't use email.\n\n===Works regarding Knuth's religious beliefs===\nIn addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]],{{Sfn | Platoni | 2006}} is also the author of ''3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated'',<ref>{{Cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=3:16 : Bible texts illuminated |year=1991 |place=Madison, [[Wisconsin|WI]] |publisher=A-R Eds |isbn=978-0-89579-252-5}}</ref> in which he examines the Bible by a process of [[systematic sampling]], namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book.  Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of [[Hermann Zapf]]. Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, ''[[Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]]'', where he published the lectures ''\"God and Computer Science\"''.\n\n===Opinion on software patents===\nAs a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting [[software patent]]s for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the [[interior-point method]] of [[linear programming]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf |title=All Questions Answered |date=March 2002 |type=article |journal=Notices |publisher=The American Mathematical Society}}</ref> He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/images/G308Knuth.pdf |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |postscript=Letter |title=Against software patents}} to the patent offices in the USA and Europe.</ref>\n\n== Computer Musings ==\nKnuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at [[Stanford University]], which he titled \"Computer Musings\".

Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created [[TeX]] and [[Metafont]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kyotoprize.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12kA_lct_EN.pdf |title=Digital Typography (Kyoto Prize Lecture, 1996) |last=Knuth| first=Donald Erwin| orig-year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Literate Programming===\nWhile developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called [[Literate Programming]], because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature. \"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf |title=Literate Programming |last=Knuth| first=Donald Erwin| orig-year=1984}}</ref>\n\nKnuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the [[WEB]] system. The same WEB source is used to ''weave'' a TeX file, and to ''tangle'' a [[Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, [[CWEB]], replaces Pascal with [[C_(programming_language)|C]].\n\nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books.\n\n==Personal life==\nDonald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology.

(Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)</blockquote>\n\nAt the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical [[XML]]-based successor to TeX, titled \"iTeX\" ({{IPA-all|i\u02d0\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6t\u025bks\u02e7\u02e5|pron}}, performed with a bell ringing), which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, [[3D printing]], input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/media/conferences/tug-2010/Don-Knuth/ |title=TUG |year=2010 |author=Don Knuth |publisher=Zeeba TV |postscript=conference}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |postscript=video recording |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |url=http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/an-earthshaking-announcement/ |publisher=Zeeba TV |title=An Earth\u2010shaking announcement}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |year=2010 |journal=[[TUGboat]] |volume=31 |title=An Earthshaking Announcement |pages=121\u201324 |issue=2 |issn=0896-3207 |url=http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb31-2/tb98knut.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 1971, Knuth was the recipient of the first [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]]. He has received various other awards including the [[Turing Award]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[John von Neumann Medal]], and the [[Kyoto Prize]].\n\nKnuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1980 in recognition of Knuth's contributions to the field of computer science.\n\nIn 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of ''Professor of The Art of Computer Programming'', which has since been revised to ''Professor [[Emeritus]] of The Art of Computer Programming''.\n\nKnuth was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at [[Stanford University]] in order to finish ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2003|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2003]].<ref name=formemrs/>\n\nKnuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fellows.siam.org/index.php?sort=year&value=2009 |title=Fellows |year=2009 |publisher=Siam}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40116 |title=Gruppe 1: Matematiske fag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110152102/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40116 |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> In 2012, he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.</ref> Other awards and honors include:\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* First [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]], 1971\n* [[Turing Award]], 1974\n* [[Lester R.

The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\">di Perna, Alan. \"Absolutely Foobulous!\". ''Guitar World''.

In order to be considered for the position, Grohl lied about his age, claiming he was 20.<ref>Lynskey, Dorian. \"[http://www.fooarchive.com/features/arena2002.htm The Man Who Fell To Earth]\". ''Arena''. December 2002.</ref> To Grohl's surprise, the band asked him to join. After waffling for a brief period, Grohl accepted the offer. Grohl dropped out of high school in his junior year; he said, \"I was 17 and extremely anxious to see the world, so I did it.\"<ref>Azerrad, p. 150</ref> Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple of live albums (their show of May 4, 1990 in Alzey, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as ''[[Your Choice Live Series Vol.10]]'') and two studio albums, ''[[No More Censorship]]'' and ''[[Fumble (album)|Fumble]]'', on which Grohl penned and sang vocals on the song \"Gods Look Down\".\n\nWhile playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of [[Melvins]] and eventually befriended the band. During a 1990 tour stop on the West Coast, Melvins' [[Buzz Osborne]] took a couple of his friends, [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]], to see the band.<ref>Levin, Hannah [http://www.houstonpress.com/events/the-melvins-1334315/ \"The Melvins\"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. houstonpress.com.

Grohl called Osborne for advice; Osborne informed him that Nirvana was looking for a drummer and gave Grohl the phone numbers of Cobain and Novoselic, who subsequently invited Grohl to Seattle to audition for Nirvana. Grohl soon joined the band full-time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sproul|first=Kris|author2=Ziegler, Mike|title=Nirvana Live Guide \u2013 1990|work=Nirvana Live Guide|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1990.php|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for the follow-up to their debut album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', having spent time recording with producer [[Butch Vig]] in [[Wisconsin]]. Initially, the plan was to release the album on [[Sub Pop]], but the band received a great deal of interest based on the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]]. In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles to record ''[[Nevermind]]'' (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'').\n\nUpon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Drummer: 100 Years of Rhythmic Power and Invention|p=253|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4768-5589-9}}</ref> At the same time, Grohl was compiling and recording his own material, which he released on a cassette called ''[[Pocketwatch (album)|Pocketwatch]]'' in 1992 on indie label Simple Machines. Rather than using his own name, Grohl released the cassette under the pseudonym \"Late!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters {{!}} Extended interview \u2013 Lollapalooza 2011|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-interview-lollapalooza-2011|work=[[Time Out Chicago]]|publisher=Time Out Group|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Grohl's initial months in Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\", and the two subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the ''Pocketwatch'' cassette. Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of ''[[Sonic Highways]]'' that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a demo of \"[[Alone + Easy Target]]\" that Grohl had recently recorded.\n\nDuring the sessions for ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'', Nirvana decided to re-record \"Color Pictures of a Marigold\" released this version as a B-side on the \"[[Heart-Shaped Box]]\" single, titled simply \"Marigold\". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for \"Scentless Apprentice\". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff was \"kind of boneheaded\", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a demo on the Nirvana box set ''[[With the Lights Out]]''). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.\n\nPrior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future [[Foo Fighters]] songs \"Exhausted\", \"[[Big Me]]\", \"February Stars\", and \"Butterflies\". On the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named \"[[You Know You're Right]]\". It was the band's final studio recording.\n\nNirvana (Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl) were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 10, 2014, 20 years after the death of Cobain. <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Foo Fighters (1994\u2013present) ===\n{{Main|Foo Fighters}}\nFollowing Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang Studios, and quickly recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on \"X-Static\" played by [[Greg Dulli]] of [[the Afghan Whigs]], Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=David|title=Dave Grohl: From Antsy Student to Nirvana to Foo Fighters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/this-is-a-call-the-life-and-times-of-dave-grohl-by-paul-brannigan-book-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands.

Nirvana's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] rep Gary Gersh had subsequently taken over as president of [[Capitol Records]] and lured Grohl to sign with the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist [[Pat Smear]] and two members of the recently disbanded [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[William Goldsmith]] (drums) and [[Nate Mendel]] (bass). Rather than re-record the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]] and was released in July 1995 as Foo Fighters' [[Foo Fighters (album)|debut album]].\n\nDuring a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of [[Gary Numan]]'s \"[[Down in the Park]]\". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief [[cameo appearance]] on  ''[[The X-Files]]'' third-season episode \"[[Pusher (The X-Files)|Pusher]]\".\n\nAfter touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie ''[[Touch (1997 film)|Touch]]''. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for vocals from [[Veruca Salt]] singer [[Louise Post]] on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by [[X (American band)|X's]] [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] on \"This Loving Thing (Lynn's Song)\". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work on their follow-up.\n\nIn the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, \"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one. [...] It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else\". Goldsmith also believed that Capitol and producer Gil Norton wanted Grohl to drum on the album.<ref name=\"roberts\">Roberts, Michael. \"[http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day Bring Back that Sunny Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090825182828/http://bestof.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day |date=August 25, 2009 }}\". ''Miami New Times''. December 3, 1998.</ref> With the album seemingly complete, Grohl headed home to Virginia with a copy of the rough mixes and found himself unhappy with the results. Grohl penned a few new songs, recording one of them, \"[[Walking After You]]\", by himself at a studio in Washington, DC. Inspired by the session, Grohl opted to move the band, without Goldsmith's knowledge,<ref name=\"roberts\" /> to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit. After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.\n\nSpeaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that \"there were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of [him] that was like, you know, [he doesn't] know if [he's] finished playing the drums yet\". He also stated that he wished he had \"handled things differently\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWhsYINKcKM#t=2m56s|title=Oxegen 2011 \u2013 Foo Fighters Dave Grohl|publisher=YouTube|date=July 10, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dave Grohl in London.jpg|thumb|upright|Grohl on stage in 2006]]\nThe effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', which eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\". Just prior to the album's release, former [[Alanis Morissette]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of Jennifer Youngblood) left the band,<ref name=\"guardian\" /> citing a need to settle down following a lifetime of touring. Smear was subsequently replaced by Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]]. Stahl departed the band prior to recording of Foo Fighters' third album<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and was replaced by touring guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]], who later became a full-fledged member during the recording of ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.\n\nGrohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his infrequent pauses he lived in [[Seattle]] and Los Angeles before returning to [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. It was there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' was recorded.<ref name=back>{{cite video|author=[[James Moll|Moll, James]] (director)|title=[[Foo Fighters: Back and Forth|Back and Forth]]|year=2011|medium=documentary|publisher=RCA}}</ref> It was recorded following the departure from Capitol and their former president Gary Gersh. Grohl described the recording experience as \"intoxicating at times\" because the band members were left completely to their own devices.

After four months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join [[Queens of the Stone Age]] and helped them to record their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. (Grohl can be seen drumming for the band in the video for the song \"[[No One Knows]]\".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain and Japan with the band<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and feeling rejuvenated by the effort, Grohl recalled the other band members to completely re-record their album at his studio in Virginia. The effort became their fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''. While initially pleased with the results, in another 2005 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Grohl admitted to not liking the record: \"Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it.\"<ref>Scaggs, Austin. [https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7281787/foos_reclaim_their_honor \"Foos Reclaim Their Honor\"]. Rolling Stone.

When \"All My Life\" ended its run, after a one-week respite, \"[[No One Knows]]\" by Queens of the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the number one spot on the Modern rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different groups.\n\nGrohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album ''[[In Your Honor]]'' on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new facility, dubbed [[Studio 606]], located in a warehouse near Los Angeles.

The German name \"Joachimsthal\" literally means \"Joachim's valley\" or \"Joachim's dale\".\nThis name found its way into other languages: [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''[[tolar]]'', Hungarian [[tall\u00e9r]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''(rigs) [[Norwegian rigsdaler|daler]]'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''(riks) [[Riksdaler|daler]]'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''dalur'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] '' (rijks) [[Dutch rijksdaalder|daalder or daler]]'', [[Ethiopian language|Ethiopian]] ''\u1273\u120b\u122a (\"talari\")'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tallero'', [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf, ''t\u00e0lleron'', ''t\u00e0liro'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''talar'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''dare'', as well as \u2013 via Dutch \u2013 into [[English language|English]] as ''dollar''.<ref name=\"observationdeck\">{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.io9.com/why-is-the-dollar-sign-a-letter-s-1683940575|title=Why Is The Dollar Sign A Letter S?|publisher=Observation Deck|accessdate=2015-02-09}}</ref>\n\nA later Dutch coin also depicting a lion was called the ''[[leeuwendaalder|leeuwendaler or leeuwendaalder]]'', literally 'lion daler'. The [[Dutch Republic]] produced these coins to accommodate its booming international trade. The ''leeuwendaler'' circulated throughout the [[Middle East]] and was imitated in several German and Italian cities. This coin was also popular in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and in the Dutch [[New Netherland|New Netherland Colony]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]).

As a result, the [[United States dollar]] was defined<ref name = \"Act 1792\">''Act of April 2, A.D. 1792 of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Section 9''.</ref> as a unit of pure silver weighing 371 4/16th grains (24.057&nbsp;grams), or 416 grains of standard silver (standard silver being defined as 1,485 parts fine silver to 179 parts alloy).<ref name = \"Act 1792 13\">Section 13 of the Act.</ref> It was specified that the \"money of account\" of the United States should be expressed in those same \"dollars\" or parts thereof. Additionally, all lesser-denomination coins were defined as percentages of the dollar coin, such that a half-dollar was to contain half as much silver as a dollar, quarter-dollars would contain one-fourth as much, and so on.\n\nIn an act passed in January 1837, the dollar's alloy (amount of non-silver metal present) was set at 15%. Subsequent coins would contain the same amount of pure silver as previously, but were reduced in overall weight (to 412.25 grains). On February 21, 1853, the quantity of silver in the lesser coins was reduced, with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins.\n\nVarious acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U.S. coins, so that today there is no legal definition of the term \"dollar\" to be found in U.S. statute.<ref name = \"At Large\">{{cite book | title = United States Statutes at Large}}</ref><ref name = \"Yeoman\">{{cite book | title = A Guide Book of United States Coins | first = RS | last = Yeoman}}</ref><ref name = \"Ewart\">{{cite book | title = Money \u2014 Ye shall have honest weights and measures | first = James E | last = Ewart}}</ref> Currently the closest thing to a definition is found in United States Code Title 31, Section 5116, paragraph b, subsection 2: \"The Secretary [of the Treasury] shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.\" However, the dollar's constitutional meaning has remained unchanged through the years (''see'', [[United States Constitution]]).\n\nSilver was mostly removed from U.S. coinage by 1965 and the dollar became a free-floating [[fiat currency]] without a commodity backing defined in terms of real gold or silver. The [[United States Mint|US Mint]] continues to make silver $1-denomination coins, but these are not intended for general circulation.\n\n==Relationship to the troy pound==\nThe quantity of silver chosen in 1792 to correspond to one dollar, namely, 371.25 grains of pure silver, is very close to the [[geometric mean]] of one [[troy pound]] and one [[pennyweight]].  In what follows, \"dollar\" will be used as a unit of mass.  A troy pound being 5760 [[grain (unit)|grains]] and a pennyweight being 240 times smaller, or 24 grains, the geometric mean is, to the nearest hundredth, 371.81 grains.  This means that the ratio of a pound to a dollar (15.52) roughly equals the ratio of a dollar to a pennyweight (15.47).  These ratios are also very close to the ratio of a gram to a grain:  15.43.  Finally, in the United States, the ratio of the value of gold to the value of silver in the period from 1792 to 1873 averaged to about 15.5, being 15 from 1792 to 1834 and around 16 from 1834 to 1873.  This is also nearly the value of the gold to silver ratio determined by Isaac Newton in 1717.<ref>{{Cite book |title=International Monetary Conference Held . . . in Paris in August 1878|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNRAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA570&lpg=PA570&dq=isaac+newton+15.57+gold+silver&source=bl&ots=YDZVZfTce8&sig=wagcw5pRYdj1FQu9sEevBNI4-5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGtJzFgonYAhVEMyYKHQsXAnsQ6AEIUzAK#v=onepage&q=isaac%20newton%2015.57%20gold%20silver&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThat these three ratios are all approximately equal has some interesting consequences.  Let the gold to silver ratio be exactly 15.5.  Then a pennyweight of gold, that is 24 grains of gold, is nearly equal in value to a dollar of silver (1 dwt of gold = $1.002 of silver).  Second, a dollar of gold is nearly equal in value to a pound of silver ($1 of gold = 5754 3/8 grains of silver = 0.999 Lb of silver).  Third, the number of grains in a dollar (371.25) roughly equals the number of grams in a troy pound (373.24).\n\nThe actual process of defining the US silver dollar had nothing to do with any geometric mean. The US government simply sampled all Spanish milled dollars in circulation in 1792 and arrived at the average weight in common use. And this was 371.25 grains of fine silver.\n\n==Usage in the United Kingdom==\n\nThere are many quotes in the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] referring to dollars as money. Coins known as \"thistle dollars\" were in use in [[Scotland]] during the 16th and 17th centuries,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Handbook of the Coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum |author=Herbert Appold Grueber |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LESLAg3XguwC&pg=PA190 }}</ref> and use of the English word, and perhaps even the use of the coin, may have begun at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This might be supported by a reference to the sum of \"ten thousand dollars\" in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (act I, scene II) (an [[anachronism]] because the real [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]], upon whom the play was based, lived in the 11th century).\n\nIn 1804, a British five-[[shilling]] piece, or [[Crown (British coin)|crown]], was sometimes called \"dollar\". It was an [[Overstrike (numismatics)|overstruck]] Spanish eight [[Spanish real|real]] coin (the famous \"piece of eight\"), the original of which was known as a Spanish dollar. Large numbers of these eight-real coins were captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], hence their re-use by the [[Bank of England]]. They remained in use until 1811.<ref>''All Things Austen: An Encyclopedia of Austen's World'' {{ISBN|0-313-33034-4}} p. 444</ref><ref>[http://www.kenelks.co.uk/coins/latermilled/17to19cent.htm ''kenelks.co.uk'']</ref> During [[World War II]], when the U.S. dollar was (approximately) valued at five shillings, the half crown (2s 6d) acquired the nickname \"half dollar\" in the UK.\n\n==Usage elsewhere==\n\nChinese demand for silver in the 19th and early 20th centuries led several countries, notably the United Kingdom, United States and [[Japan]], to mint [[trade dollar]]s, which were often of slightly different weights from comparable domestic coinage. Silver dollars reaching China (whether Spanish, trade, or other) were often stamped with Chinese characters known as \"[[Chop marks on coins|chop marks]]\", which indicated that that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and deemed genuine.\n\n===Other national currencies called \u201cdollar\u201d===\n\n[[File:Nz 1d front.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand]] [[New Zealand dollar|one-dollar coin]]]]\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Zimbabwe $500 11a 2001 Obverse.jpg\n | image2            = Zimbabwe $500 11a 2001 Reverse.jpg\n | footer            = 500 old [[Zimbabwean dollar]] bill of the first Zimbabwean dollar\n | width             = 220\n}}\n[[File:Zimbabwe 100000000000 Dollars Bill 2008.jpg|thumb|A 100 billion dollars special agro-cheque issued during the [[hyperinflation in Zimbabwe]]]]\n\nPrior to 1873, the silver dollar circulated in many parts of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold [[British sovereign coin|sovereign]] of roughly $1 = 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver ''thaler'' coins in 1871, in the wake of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the worldwide price of silver began to fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silver-investor.com/charlessavoie/cs_3-29-05_monetarymadhouse.htm |title=Monetary Madhouse, Charles Savoie, 2005 |publisher=Silver-investor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}</ref> This resulted in the U.S. [[Coinage Act (1873)]] which put the United States onto a '[[de facto]]' gold standard. [[Canada]] and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly [[Latin America]] and the [[Far East]]. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the [[Canadian dollar]] began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and [[South East Asia]] began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The [[Straits dollar]] adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and [[Hong Kong]] came off the [[silver standard]], the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) [[Pound sterling|sterling]], whereas the [[Hong Kong dollar]] was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).\n\nThe term \"dollar\" has also been adopted by other countries for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a [[\u00a3sd]]-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include the [[Australian dollar]], the [[New Zealand dollar]], the [[Jamaican dollar]], the [[Cayman Islands dollar]], the [[Fijian dollar|Fiji dollar]], the [[Namibian dollar]], the [[Rhodesian dollar]], the [[Zimbabwe dollar]], and the [[Solomon Islands dollar]].\n*The ''[[Samoan tala|tala]]'' is based on the [[Samoan language|Samoan]] pronunciation of the word \"dollar\".\n*The [[Slovenian tolar]] had the same etymological origin as dollar (that is, ''[[thaler]]'').\n'''\n\n==Economies that use a dollar==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. Both the decay and burning of wood releases much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. Although an accumulation of wood is generally necessary for carbon sequestration, in some forests the network of symbiotic fungi that surround the trees' roots can store a significant amount of carbon, storing it underground even if the tree which supplied it dies and decays, or is harvested and burned.<ref>K.E. Clemmensen, et al.\n[https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1231923 \"Roots and Associated Fungi Drive Long-Term Carbon Sequestration in Boreal Forest\"]</ref>  Another way carbon can be sequestered by forests is for the wood to be harvested and turned into long-lived products, with new young trees replacing them.<ref>Prentice, I.C.

Forests can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmental circumstances. Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide (see [[carbon dioxide sink]] and [[carbon cycle]]).\n\nIn deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/jun/HQ_04183_deforestation.html NASA Data Shows Deforestation Affects Climate In The Amazon].

The elite's (nobility and higher clergy) protection of their own hunting privileges and game often protected significant woodland.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=|pages=309}}</ref>\n\nMajor parts in the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the population were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the [[Benedictine]] and [[commerce|Commercial]] orders) and some [[feudal]] lords' recruiting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and fiscal conditions. Even when speculators sought to encourage towns, settlers needed an agricultural belt around or sometimes within defensive walls. When populations were quickly decreased by causes such as the [[Black Death]] or devastating warfare (for example, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol]] hordes in eastern and central Europe, [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany), this could lead to settlements being abandoned. The land was reclaimed by nature, but the [[secondary forest]]s usually lacked the original [[biodiversity]].\n[[File:Rugendas - Defrichement d une Foret.jpg|thumb|Deforestation of Brazil's [[Atlantic Forest]] c.1820\u20131825]]\nFrom 1100 to 1500 AD, significant deforestation took place in [[Western Europe]] as a result of the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]. The large-scale building of wooden sailing ships by European (coastal) naval owners since the 15th century for exploration, [[Colonialism|colonisation]], [[slave trade]]\u2013and other trade on the high seas consumed many forest resources. [[Piracy]] also contributed to the over harvesting of forests, as in Spain. This led to a weakening of the domestic economy after Columbus' discovery of America, as the economy became dependent on colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=pg.309|pages=703}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Changes In the Land'' (1983), [[William Cronon]] analyzed and documented 17th-century English colonists' reports of increased seasonal flooding in [[New England]] during the period when new settlers initially cleared the forests for agriculture. They believed flooding was linked to widespread forest clearing upstream.\n\nThe massive use of [[charcoal]] on an industrial scale in [[Early Modern Europe]] was a new type of consumption of western forests; even in Stuart England, the relatively primitive production of charcoal has already reached an impressive level. Stuart England was so widely deforested that it depended on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] trade for ship timbers, and looked to the untapped forests of [[New England]] to supply the need. Each of Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] war ships at Trafalgar (1805) required 6,000 mature oaks for its construction. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] planted [[oak]] forests to supply the French navy in the future. When the oak plantations matured in the mid-19th century, the masts were no longer required because shipping had changed.\n\n[[Norman F. Cantor]]'s summary of the effects of late medieval deforestation applies equally well to Early Modern Europe:<ref>{{cite book|author=Cantor, Norman F. |title=The civilization of the Middle Ages: a completely revised and expanded edition of Medieval history, the life and death of a civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiYM2_HhJgC|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=9 June 1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|page=564}}</ref>\n{{Quote|Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 they were running short of wood for heating and cooking. They were faced with a nutritional decline because of the elimination of the generous supply of wild game that had inhabited the now-disappearing forests, which throughout medieval times had provided the staple of their carnivorous high-protein diet. By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize.}}\n\n==Industrial era==\nIn the 19th century, introduction of [[steamboat]]s in the United States was the cause of deforestation of banks of major rivers, such as the [[Mississippi River]], with increased and more severe flooding one of the environmental results. The steamboat crews cut wood every day from the riverbanks to fuel the steam engines. Between [[St. Louis]] and the confluence with the [[Ohio River]] to the south, the Mississippi became more wide and shallow, and changed its channel laterally. Attempts to improve navigation by the use of [[Snagboat|snag pullers]] often resulted in crews' clearing large trees 100 to {{convert|200|ft|m}} back from the banks. Several French colonial towns of the [[Illinois Country]], such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]] and St. Philippe, [[Illinois]], were flooded and abandoned in the late 19th century, with a loss to the cultural record of their [[archeology]].<ref>Norris, F.

An innovative project to try and remedy this situation involves landholders in upstream areas being paid by downstream water users to conserve forests. The landholders receive US$20 to conserve the trees, avoid polluting livestock practices, and enhance the biodiversity and forest carbon on their land. They also receive US$30, which purchases a beehive, to compensate for conservation for two hectares of water-sustaining forest for five years. Honey revenue per hectare of forest is US$5 per year, so within five years, the landholder has sold US$50 of honey.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/payments-for-watershed-services-a-driver-of-climate-compatible-development/?loclang=en_gb ''Payments for watershed services: A driver of climate compatible development''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 30 December 2013.</ref> The project is being conducted by [[Fundaci\u00f3n Natura Bolivia]] and Rare Conservation, with support from the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].\n\n=== Land rights ===\n[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]\nTransferring rights over land from public domain to its indigenous inhabitants is argued to be a cost effective strategy to conserve forests.<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/22/india-follow-china-saving-forest-people-land-rights|title=India should follow China to find a way out of the woods on saving forest people|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=7 August 2016|date=22 July 2016}}</ref> This includes the protection of such rights entitled in existing laws, such as India\u2019s [[The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006|Forest Rights Act]].<ref name=Guardian1/> The transferring of such rights in [[China]], perhaps the largest [[land reform]] in modern times, has been argued to have increased forest cover.<ref name=rightsandresources>{{cite web|url=http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/view/chinas-forest-tenure-reforms-impacts-and-implications-for-choice-conservation-and-climate-change/|title=China\u2019s forest tenure reforms|publisher=rightsandresources.org |accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> In [[Brazil]], forested areas given tenure to indigenous groups have even lower rates of clearing than [[national park]]s.<ref name=rightsandresources/>\n\n===Farming===\nNew methods are being developed to farm more intensively, such as high-yield [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] crops, [[greenhouse]], [[autonomous building]] gardens, and [[hydroponic]]s. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields. In cyclic [[agriculture]], cattle are grazed on farm land that is resting and rejuvenating. Cyclic agriculture actually increases the fertility of the soil. Intensive farming can also decrease soil nutrients by consuming at an accelerated rate the trace minerals needed for crop growth.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most promising approach, however, is the concept of [[forest gardening|food forests]] in [[permaculture]], which consists of agroforestal systems carefully designed to mimic natural forests, with an emphasis on plant and animal species of interest for food, timber and other uses. These systems have low dependence on [[fossil fuels]] and [[agro-chemicals]], are highly self-maintaining, highly productive, and with strong positive impact on soil and water quality, and [[biodiversity]].\n\n===Monitoring deforestation===\nThere are multiple methods that are appropriate and reliable for reducing and monitoring deforestation. One method is the \u201cvisual interpretation of aerial photos or satellite imagery that is labor-intensive but does not require high-level training in computer image processing or extensive computational resources\u201d.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Another method includes hot-spot analysis (that is, locations of rapid change) using expert opinion or coarse resolution satellite data to identify locations for detailed digital analysis with high resolution satellite images.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Deforestation is typically assessed by quantifying the amount of area deforested, measured at the present time.\nFrom an environmental point of view, quantifying the damage and its possible consequences is a more important task, while conservation efforts are more focused on forested land protection and development of land-use alternatives to avoid continued deforestation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Deforestation rate and total area deforested, have been widely used for monitoring deforestation in many regions, including the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring by INPE.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> A global satellite view is available.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest |title=Global Forest Change \u2013 Google Crisis Map|work=Google Crisis Map|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/warning-to-forest-destroyers-this-scientist-will-catch-you-1.20730 |title=Warning to forest destroyers: this scientist will catch you|work=Nature News & Comment|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Forest management===\nEfforts to stop or slow deforestation have been attempted for many centuries because it has long been known that deforestation can cause environmental damage sufficient in some cases to cause societies to collapse. In [[Tonga]], paramount rulers developed policies designed to prevent conflicts between short-term gains from converting forest to farmland and long-term problems forest loss would cause,<ref>Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 301\u2013302 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.</ref> while during the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], Japan,<ref>Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 320\u2013331 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.</ref> the sh\u014dguns developed a highly sophisticated system of long-term planning to stop and even reverse deforestation of the preceding centuries through substituting timber by other products and more efficient use of land that had been farmed for many centuries. In 16th-century Germany, landowners also developed [[silviculture]] to deal with the problem of deforestation. However, these policies tend to be limited to environments with ''good rainfall'', ''no dry season'' and ''very young [[soil]]s'' (through [[volcano|volcanism]] or [[glaciation]]). This is because on older and less fertile soils trees grow too slowly for silviculture to be economic, whilst in areas with a strong dry season there is always a risk of forest fires destroying a tree crop before it matures.\n\nIn the areas where \"[[slash-and-burn]]\" is practiced, switching to \"[[slash-and-char]]\" would prevent the rapid deforestation and subsequent degradation of soils. The [[biochar]] thus created, given back to the soil, is not only a durable [[carbon sequestration]] method, but it also is an extremely beneficial [[Soil conditioner|amendment]] to the soil. Mixed with [[biomass]] it brings the creation of [[terra preta]], one of the richest soils on the planet and the only one known to regenerate itself.\n\n====Sustainable practices====\n[[File:Bamboo Feb09.jpg|thumb|Bamboo is advocated as a more sustainable alternative for cutting down wood for fuel.<ref name=bamboo/>]]\nCertification, as provided by global certification systems such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council]], contributes to tackling deforestation by creating market demand for timber from sustainably managed forests. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), \"A major condition for the adoption of sustainable forest management is a demand for products that are produced sustainably and consumer willingness to pay for the higher costs entailed. Certification represents a shift from regulatory approaches to market incentives to promote sustainable forest management. By promoting the positive attributes of forest products from sustainably managed forests, certification focuses on the demand side of environmental conservation.\"<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0350e/i0350e00.HTM \"State of the World's Forests 2009\"].

''National Geographic News'', 13 November 2006.</ref>\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of China]], where large scale destruction of forests has occurred, the government has in the past required that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in other forest services. The government claims that at least 1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] trees have been planted in China every year since 1982. This is no longer required today, but 12 March of every year in China is the Planting Holiday. Also, it has introduced the [[Green Wall of China]] project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. However, due to the large percentage of trees dying off after planting (up to 75%), the project is not very successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s.<ref name=Owen/> The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China's land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% two decades ago and now is 16.55%.<ref name=battling/>\n\nAn ambitious proposal for China is the Aerially Delivered Re-forestation and Erosion Control System and the proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the [[Seawater Greenhouse]].\n\nIn Western countries, increasing consumer demand for wood products that have been produced and harvested in a sustainable manner is causing forest landowners and [[Wood industry|forest industries]] to become increasingly accountable for their forest management and timber harvesting practices.\n\nThe [[Arbor Day Foundation]]'s Rain Forest Rescue program is a charity that helps to prevent deforestation. The charity uses donated money to buy up and preserve rainforest land before the [[lumber]] companies can buy it. The Arbor Day Foundation then protects the land from deforestation. This also locks in the way of life of the primitive tribes living on the forest land. Organizations such as [[Community Forestry International]], [[Cool Earth]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[African Conservation Foundation]] and [[Greenpeace]] also focus on preserving forest habitats.

Plantations that yield 10 cubic meters per hectare a year would supply enough wood for trading of 5% of the world\u2019s existing forestland. By contrast, natural forests produce about 1\u20132 cubic meters per hectare; therefore, 5\u201310 times more forestland would be required to meet demand.

One example of deliberate deforestation played out in the U.S. [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|zone of occupation]] in Germany after [[World War II]] ended in 1945. Before the onset of the [[Cold War]], defeated Germany was still considered a potential future threat rather than a potential future ally. To address this threat, the victorious [[Allies of World War II | Allies]] made attempts to [[Industrial plans for Germany|lower German industrial potential]], of which forests were deemed{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} an element. Sources in the U.S. government admitted that the purpose of this was that the \"ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests\". As a consequence of the practice of clear-felling, deforestation resulted which could \"be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century\".<ref>Balabkins, Nicholas (1964) \"Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945\u20131948, Rutgers University Press. p. 119.

Currently, the Gobi desert is the fastest moving desert on Earth; according to some researchers, the Gobi Desert swallows up over 1,300 square miles (3,370&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land annually. This has destroyed many villages in its path. Currently, photos show that the Gobi Desert has expanded to the point the entire nation of Croatia could fit inside its area.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html?_r=0</ref>\nThis is causing a major problem for the people of China.

This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials.

This wall is a much larger-scale version of what American farmers did in the 1930s to stop the great Midwest dust bowl. This plan was proposed in the late 1970s, and has become a major ecological engineering project that is not predicted to end until the year 2055. According to Chinese reports, there have been nearly 66,000,000,000 trees planted in China's great green wall.<ref>http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/</ref>\nDue to the success that China has been finding in stopping the spread of desertification, plans are currently be made in Africa to start a \"wall\" along the borders of the Sahara desert as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nTechniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil.\n\nFixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].\n\nSome soils (for example, clay), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of sandy soils). Some techniques as za\u00ef or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth \u2013 National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&nbsp;m long, 1&nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home \u2013 Justdiggit|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nEnriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.<ref>[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}</ref>\n\nSome research centra (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrients from the soil).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=D\u00e9partement Biologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale \u2013 Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt-flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in  [[Saudi-Arabia]]. These salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.<ref>[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-Andr\u00e9 Berdell\u00e9 July 2011] H2O magazine</ref>\n\n[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank\u2019s BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest \u2014 A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change \u2013 Water Matters \u2013 State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|left|thumb|It is argued that managed grazing methods are able to restore grasslands.<ref name=ASavory/>]]\n\n===Managed grazing===\nRestoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air into plant material.

Its eastern end is in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], near [[Newark, California|Newark]] in the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]], and its western end is in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. Bridging [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side. Like the [[San Mateo Bridge]] to the north, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s parallel the bridge.\n\n==History and engineering features==\n[[Image:DumbartonBr.jpg|thumb|right|The original vertical-lift span of the Dumbarton Bridge, shown in 1984 shortly before it was demolished]]The bridge has never been officially named, but its commonly used name comes from Dumbarton Point, named in 1876 after [[Dumbarton, Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge opened on January 17, 1927 and was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. A portion of this old drawbridge remains as a fishing pier on the east side of the Bay. The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the state for $2.5 million in 1951.\n\nIts age and the two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span led to a replacement bridge, built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989 in response to the temporary closing of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.<ref>\"Dumbarton Bridge\" {{cite web|url=http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221185117/http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |archivedate=2012-02-21 |df= }}</ref> The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A {{convert|340|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} center span provides {{convert|85|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of pre-stressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck. In 1970 the movie ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' was filmed at the toll plaza and showed Maude speeding and disobeying a police officer.\n\nThe center span of the original bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in September 1984.\n[[Image:Dumbarton Bridge CA from the air.JPG|thumb|right|A view from the air, above Palo Alto, looking towards Fremont]]\n\n==Roadway Connections==\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] by a [[freeway]] segment north of the Fremont end.\nThere is no freeway connection between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] and the southwest end of the Dumbarton Bridge. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge. These are (from northwest to southeast):\n# the Bayfront Expressway, a [[limited-access road]] linking to U.S. 101 at Marsh Road, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] (the official routing of SR 84)\n# Willow Road ([[California State Route 114|SR 114]]), an approximately one-mile expressway through east Menlo Park to U.S. 101\n# University Avenue ([[California State Route 109|SR 109]]), an [[arterial road]] and the main commercial street of [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]].\n\nThe Willow Road and University Avenue junctions with Bayfront Expressway are at-grade intersections controlled by traffic lights; there are two additional controlled intersections at Chilco Road and Marsh Road, and the Marsh Road interchange on U.S. 101 is a [[Partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo]]. The result is that Bayfront Expressway is frequently congested, and when not congested is often the site of high-speed car crashes. In 2007, prominent author [[David Halberstam]] was killed in one such crash at the Willow Road intersection.\n\nAccess to [[Interstate 280 in California|I-280]] is available via State Route 84 to [[Woodside Road]] (as signed) or other arterial routes. There are no cross-Peninsula freeway connections between State Routes 92 and 85 (which is so far south that it technically lies in Silicon Valley and not on the Peninsula). In addition, there are no direct cross-Peninsula arterial routes between State Route 84 and Page Mill Road, a five-mile gap.\n\nAlthough the present situation has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to [[Silicon Valley]]), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101.\n\nBus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]], [[AC Transit]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue. AC Transit also runs Transbay buses U ([[Fremont (BART station)|Fremont BART]] and [[Fremont-Centerville (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]] to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and DA (Ardenwood to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Facebook]] headquarters) across the bridge. The free [[Stanford Marguerite Shuttle]] also runs buses AE-F and EB across the bridge.\n\n==Environmental factors==\n\nWhen the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[marine biology|aquatic]] and [[landform|terrestrial]] environment. Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto]]. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.<ref>C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Harry Seidman et al., ''Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis for the Dumbarton Bridge Replacement Project'', ESL Inc., prepared for the Bay Area Division of Toll Crossings (1973)</ref>\n\nThe area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.\n\nNear the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and the [[Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs.<ref>''San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide'', by California State Coastal Conservancy, University of California Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-520-08878-6}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the east end of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the east end of the bridge is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]] from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills (Alameda County)|Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. Since July 2010, the toll rate for passenger cars is $5.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Toll Questions |publisher=Bay Area Toll Authority |date=2010-06-01 |url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/faq.htm#2 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tv1MQCqO?url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/faq.htm#2 |archivedate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Toll Increase Information |publisher=Bay Area Toll Authority |date=2010-06-01 |url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/ |accessdate=2010-06-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tv15npOZ?url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/ |archivedate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $5 per axle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toll Increase Information: Multi-Axle Vehicles |publisher=Bay Area Toll Authority |date=2012-07-01 |url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/multi-axle.htm |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234900/http://www.mtc.ca.gov/tolls/multi-axle.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}</ref> Drivers may either pay by cash or use the [[FasTrak]] electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only [[HOV lane]], allowing [[carpool]] vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.\n\n===Historical toll rates===\nPrior to 1969, tolls on the Dumbarton Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1927 span had a toll of $0.40 per car plus $0.05 per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 per car. It was raised to $0.70 in 1969, then $0.75 in 1976. The toll per car remained at $0.75 when the replacement bridge opened in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist4/documents/tollfees.pdf | title=History of California's Bridge Tolls | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] | accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the Dumbarton Bridge, was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988.<ref>[http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/rm1.htm Regional Measure 1 Toll Bridge Program].

Caltrans administers the \"second dollar\" seismic surcharge, and receives some of the MTC-administered funds to perform other maintenance work on the bridges.

Oilman [[Clint Murchison, Jr.|Clint Murchison Jr.]] had been trying to get an NFL expansion team in Dallas (as was [[Lamar Hunt]] \u2013 who ended up with an [[Kansas City Chiefs|AFL franchise]]), but [[George Preston Marshall]], owner of the [[Washington Redskins]], had a monopoly in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nMurchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins from Marshall in 1958. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. This infuriated Murchison and he called off the deal. Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\" and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959. Murchison purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.  Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he owned the song and Marshall could not play it during games. After a few Marshall expletives, Murchison gave the rights to \"Hail to the Redskins\" to Marshall for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a franchise at that time, and a [[Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry|rivalry]] was born.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 01 - Duane Thomas.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Cowboys playing against the Dolphins in [[Super Bowl VI]].]]\nFrom [[1970 NFL season|1970]] through [[1979 NFL season|1979]], the Cowboys won 105 regular season games, more than any other NFL franchise during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/fVEzy|title=Team Game Finder Query Results|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> In addition, they appeared in 5 and won two [[Super Bowl]]s, at the end of the [[1971 NFL season|1971]] and [[1977 NFL season|1977]] regular seasons.\n\n===1980s===\n[[Danny White]] became the Cowboys' starting quarterback in 1980 after quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] retired. Despite going to 12\u20134 in [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|1980]], the Cowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs]] they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by defeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 30\u201327. For the NFC Championship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia, the team that won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their first conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20\u20137.\n\n[[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|1981]] brought another division championship for the Cowboys. They entered the [[1981-82 NFL playoffs]] as the number 2 seed. Their first game of the postseason saw them blowout and shutout Tampa Bay 38\u20130. For the Conference Title game they were pitted against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], the number 1 seed. Despite having a late 4th quarter 27\u201321 lead, they would lose to the 49ers 28\u201327. 49ers quarterback [[Joe Montana]] led his team to an 89-yard game-winning touchdown drive connecting to [[Dwight Clark]] in a play known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]].\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 02 - Butch Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Cowboys playing against the Broncos in Super Bowl XII.]]\nThe [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|1982 season]] was shortened after a player strike. With a 6\u20133 record Dallas made it to the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs]] they eliminated the Buccaneers 30\u201317 in the Wild Card round and dispatched the Packers 37\u201326 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd consecutive Conference championship game. 3 times was not a charm for the Cowboys as they fell 31\u201317 to division rival and eventual [[Super Bowl XVII]] champions Redskins.\n\nFor the [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|1983 season]] the Cowboys went 12\u20134 and made it once again to the playoffs but were defeated at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24\u201317. Prior to the [[1984 Dallas Cowboys season|1984 season]], [[Bum Bright|H.R. \"Bum\" Bright]] purchased the Dallas Cowboys from [[Clint Murchison Jr.]] Dallas posted a 9\u20137 record that season but missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons. After going 10\u20136 in [[1985 Dallas Cowboys season|1985]] and winning a division title, the Cowboys were blown out in the Divisional round at home to the Rams 20\u20130.\n\nHard times came for the organization as they went 7\u20139 in [[1986 Dallas Cowboys season|1986]], 7\u20138 in [[1987 Dallas Cowboys season|1987]], and 3\u201313 in [[1988 Dallas Cowboys season|1988]]. During this time period Bright became disenchanted with the team. During the [[Savings and Loan crisis]], the team and Mr. Bright's Savings and Loan were taken over by the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation|FSLIC]]. During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta in 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at coach [[Tom Landry]]'s play calling. The FSLIC forced Mr. Bright to sell the Cowboys to [[Jerry Jones]] on February 25, 1989.\n\nJones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history, replacing him with [[University of Miami]] head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was also Jerry Jones' teammate in [[University of Arkansas]] as a fellow defensive lineman and Michael Irvin was under his tutelage in college. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected [[UCLA]] quarterback [[Troy Aikman]]. Later that same year, they would [[Herschel Walker trade|trade veteran running back]] [[Herschel Walker]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989 season]] with a 1\u201315 record, their worst in almost 30 years, \"The Trade\" later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.<ref>{{Citation|last=Law Nation|title=The Story of Dallas Cowboys 1992 3rd Super Bowl|date=2017-01-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQcPRZLqeK8|accessdate=2017-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nJohnson quickly returned the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback [[Daryl Johnston]] and center [[Mark Stepnoski]] in 1989, running back [[Emmitt Smith]] in 1990, defensive tackle [[Russell Maryland]] and offensive tackle [[Erik Williams]] in 1991, and safety [[Darren Woodson]] in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]], guard [[Nate Newton]], linebacker [[Ken Norton Jr.]], and offensive lineman [[Mark Tuinei]], defensive lineman [[Jim Jeffcoat]], and veteran pickups such as tight end [[Jay Novacek]] and defensive end [[Charles Haley]]. \n[[File:Texas Stadium - Dallas Cowboys World Champions Mural.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Five-time World Champions Mural]]\nThings started to look up for the franchise in [[1990 Dallas Cowboys season|1990]]. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the [[San Diego Chargers]] 17\u201314. They went 2\u20137 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish the season with a 4th place 7\u20139 record.\n\nComing into [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|1991]] the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator [[Dave Shula]] with [[Norv Turner]]; the Cowboys raced to a 6\u20135 start, then defeated the previously-unbeaten [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]] despite injury to [[Troy Aikman]].  Backup [[Steve Beuerlein]] took over and the Cowboys finished 11\u20135. In the Wild Card round they defeated the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] 17\u201313 for the Cowboys first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional round their season ended in a 38\u20136 playoff rout by the [[1991 Detroit Lions season|Lions]].\n\nIn [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|1992]] Dallas set a team record for regular season wins with a 13\u20133 mark. They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23\u201310. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys won that game 34\u201310 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first time in 10 years. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. On January 17, 1993 the Cowboys went to [[Candlestick Park]] and defeated the 49ers 30\u201320 to clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978. Dallas defeated the [[Buffalo Bills]] 52\u201317 in [[Super Bowl XXVII]], during which they forced a record nine turnovers. Johnson became the first coach to claim a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football.\n\nDespite starting the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]] season 0\u20132, they again defeated the Buffalo Bills in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]], 30\u201313 (becoming the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0\u20132). Dallas finished the regular season 12\u20134 as the number 1 seed of the NFC. They defeated the Green Bay Packers 27\u201317 in the divisional round. In the NFC Conference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38\u201321. Dallas sent a then-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety [[Thomas Everett]], Irvin, Johnston, Maryland, Newton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski and Williams.\n\n[[File:Dallas Cowboys stadium championship banners 4.JPG|thumb|right|Dallas Cowboys championship banners inside AT&T Stadium]]\nOnly weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and Jones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his resignation. Jones then hired former [[University of Oklahoma]] head coach [[Barry Switzer]] to replace Johnson. The Cowboys finished 12\u20134 in [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|1994]]. They once again clinched a first round bye and defeated Green Bay 35\u20139 in the Divisional Round. They missed the Super Bowl, however, after losing to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38\u201328.\n\nPrior to the start of [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|1995 season]] Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] away from San Francisco. Dallas started the season 4\u20130 including shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35\u20130 at [[Giants Stadium]] to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12\u20134 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30\u201311 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38\u201327. In [[Super Bowl XXX]] the Cowboys defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 27\u201317 at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.\n\nThe glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league for the first five games of [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|1996]] following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2\u20133. They finished the regular season with a 10\u20136 record, won the [[NFC East]] title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40\u201315 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26\u201317 by the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].\n\nThe Cowboys went 6\u201310 in [[1997 Dallas Cowboys season|1997]] (including losing their last 6 games of the season), with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/01/american-football-dallas-cowboys|title=Jeff Pearlman on the unbelievable story of the implosion of the Dallas Cowboys|work=the Guardian|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}</ref> As a result, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers offensive coordinator [[Chan Gailey]] was hired to take his place.\n\nGailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10\u20136 record in [[1998 Dallas Cowboys season|1998]] and an [[NFC East]] championship, but the Cowboys were defeated in the playoffs by the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 20\u20137.\n\nIn [[1999 Dallas Cowboys season|1999]] Dallas went 8\u20138 (during which Irvin suffered a career-ending spinal injury in a loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]) ending in another playoff loss (this time to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 27\u201310). Gailey was fired and became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.\n\n===2000\u201309===\nDefensive coordinator [[Dave Campo]] was promoted to head coach for the [[2000 Dallas Cowboys season|2000 season]]. Prior to the season starting cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41\u201314 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB [[Randall Cunningham]] filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5\u201311 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.\n\n[[2001 Dallas Cowboys season|2001]] was another hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released from the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received. Jerry Jones signed [[Tony Banks (American football)|Tony Banks]] as a QB. Banks had been a starter for half of the season the previous year for the Super Bowl Champion [[Baltimore Ravens]] before being benched. Jones also drafted QB [[Quincy Carter]] in the second round of that year's draft, but Banks was released during the preseason. [[Ryan Leaf]], [[Anthony Wright (American football)|Anthony Wright]], and [[Clint Stoerner]] all competed for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at 5\u201311, last place in the NFC East. They did sweep the Redskins for the 4th consecutive season.\n\nPrior to the [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|2002 season]] Dallas drafted safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]] with the 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Houston Texans]] 19\u201310 on Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by [[Walter Payton]]. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, that was their final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with another last place 5\u201311 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20\u201314 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as head coach at the conclusion of the season.\n\nJones then lured [[Bill Parcells]] out of retirement to coach the Cowboys. The Cowboys became the surprise team of the [[2003 Dallas Cowboys season|2003 season]] getting off to a hot 7\u20132 season, but went 3\u20134 for the rest of the season. They were able to win the division with a 10\u20136 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers 29\u201310.\n\nIn [[2004 Dallas Cowboys season|2004]] Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success, and ended 6\u201310. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by [[Vinny Testaverde]].\n\nDallas got off to a hot 7\u20133 start for the [[2005 Dallas Cowboys season|2005 season]] but ended the season in 3rd place with a 9\u20137 record. Prior to the season starting the Cowboys signed veteran [[Drew Bledsoe]] as a quarterback.\n\n[[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|2006]] was an interesting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season Dallas signed free agent wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] who was talented yet controversial. The Cowboys started the season 3\u20132. During a week 7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup [[Tony Romo]]. Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 38\u201322. However, Romo was named the starter for team and went 5\u20131 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9\u20137 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21\u201320. After the season Parcells retired and was replaced as head coach by [[Wade Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboysplus.com/classic/recordbook/coaches/123102campo.html |title=Dallas Cowboys Coaches |publisher=Cowboysplus.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDallas started off the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|2007 season]] with a bang. They began the season with a 12\u20131 start, including winning their first five games. Their only loss during that time span came against [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England]], who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first round bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Cowboys lost in the divisional round 21\u201317 to the eventual [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]] champion [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].\n\nIn the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3\u20130 for the second straight year, en route to a 4\u20131 start. However, things soon went downhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in an overtime loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. With [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] and [[Brooks Bollinger]] playing as backups, Dallas went 1\u20132 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as Dallas went 3\u20130. However, injuries mounted during the season with the team losing several starters for the year, such as [[Kyle Kosier]], [[Felix Jones]], safety [[Roy Williams (safety)|Roy Williams]] and punter [[Mat McBriar]], and several other starters playing with injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6 |title=The Injury List Just Keeps On Growing |accessdate=January 11, 2010 |date=October 28, 2008 |publisher=DallasCowboys.com |last=Ellis |first=Josh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031063704/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=45AB0937-BED6-CFD1-02344872888433B6 |archivedate=October 31, 2008 }}</ref> Entering December, the 8\u20134 Cowboys underperformed, finishing 1\u20133. They failed to make the playoffs after losing at Philadelphia in the final regular season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs instead.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind storm. The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most serious injuries were special teams coach [[Joe DeCamillis]], who suffered fractured cervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his neck, and [[Rich Behm]], the team's 33-year-old scouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed.\n\nThe 2009 season started on a positive with a road win against Tampa Bay, but fortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2\u20132 start. In week five, with starting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver [[Miles Austin]] got his first start of the season and had a record setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns) to help lead Dallas to an overtime win over Kansas City. Following their [[bye week]], Dallas went on a three-game winning streak including wins over Atlanta and NFC East division rival Philadelphia. Despite entering December with a record of 8\u20133, Dallas lost its slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the Dallas team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 24\u201317 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, Dallas posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17\u20130) and Philadelphia (24\u20130) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. Dallas ended their playoff run after a hard divisional playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n===2010\u201313===\nAfter beginning the [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|2010 season]] at 1\u20137, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Jason Garrett]] as the interim head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/11/nfl-network-cowboys-fire-wade-phillips-as-head-coach-promote-jason-garrett/1|title=NFL Network: Cowboys fire Wade Phillips as head coach, promote Jason Garrett|accessdate=2010-11-08 | work=USA Today|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The Cowboys finished the season 6\u201310.\n\nWith the 9th pick of the 1st round of the 2011 draft, the Cowboys selected [[University of Southern California|USC]] tackle [[Tyron Smith]].\n\nTo start the [[2011 Dallas Cowboys season|2011 season]] the Cowboys played the New York Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11, 2011. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 Dallas traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10\u20137, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by [[Jon Kitna]]. Kitna threw 1 Touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17\u20137. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On the Cowboys opening possession after 49ers punt, Romo found WR Jesse Holley on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker Dan Bailey.\n\nDallas ended the season 8\u20138. They were in a position to win the NFC East but lost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on [[NBC]] which allowed New York to win the division. The Giants would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]].\n\nThe Cowboys started off the [[2012 Dallas Cowboys season|2012 season]] on a high note by defeating the defending Super Bowl Champion New York Giants 24\u201317 on the opening night of the season. They would hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a close Week 6 game to eventual [[Super Bowl XXVII]] Champion Baltimore Ravens 31\u201329 at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore.\n\nGoing into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning the division. Standing in their way was the Redskins who had beat them on Thanksgiving at [[AT&T Stadium]] and whom were also one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by [[Robert Griffin III]] the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28-18. Dallas once again finished the season 8\u20138.\n\nIn the [[2013 Dallas Cowboys season|2013 season]] Dallas started off by defeating the Giants for the second straight year this time 36\u201331. It was the first time since [[AT&T Stadium]] had opened back in 2009 that the Cowboys were able to defeat New York at home. The win was punctuated by [[Brandon Carr]] returning an [[Eli Manning]] interception to a touchdown late in the 4th quarter.\n\nFor the third straight year Dallas once again found themselves stuck in the .500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51\u201348. They battled it out with Philadelphia for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back to back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division games having a 5\u20130 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24\u201323 on Week 16 thanks to late game heroics of [[Tony Romo]]. However Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup QB [[Kyle Orton]] to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game ending interception to the Eagles which allowed Philly to win 24\u201322. Dallas ended the year at 8\u20138 for the third year in a row. The only difference of this 8\u20138 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes.\n\n===2014===\n{{very long section|date=October 2018}}\n{{Main article|2014 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nTo start off the [[2014 Dallas Cowboys season|2014 season]] Dallas began by losing to San Francisco 28\u201317. After that they went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was defeating the Seahawks at [[CenturyLink Field]] 30\u201323. In Week 8, the Redskins won in overtime 20\u201317, and Romo's back became once again injured. He missed next week, a home loss to the Arizona Cardinals 28\u201317 with backup QB [[Brandon Weeden]]. Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31\u201317 victory of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] which was played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London, England]] as part of the [[NFL International Series]].\n\nDallas played into their traditional Thanksgiving home game, this time against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8\u20133 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33\u201310. They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41\u201328 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009. This was the first time that Dallas played on back to back Thursdays. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21\u20130. Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38\u201327 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10\u20134. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the Colts 42\u20137 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and an 8\u20130 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44\u201317. They would also finish December 4\u20130 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed [[Detroit Lions]] in the wild card round of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14\u20130 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. [[Matt Prater]] of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17\u20137. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback [[Matthew Stafford]] on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20\u20137. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20\u201314. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end [[Brandon Pettigrew]], but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker [[Anthony Hitchens]] in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24\u201320. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2 minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end [[DeMarcus Lawrence]], who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24\u201320. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game. The following week, the Cowboys traveled to [[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to play the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] in the divisional round. Despite having a 14\u20137 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26\u201321, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back [[DeMarco Murray]] to become a free agent. Murray signed with the [[Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry|division rival]] [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. On July 15 wide receiver [[Dez Bryant]] signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.\n\n===2015===\n{{Main article|2015 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAt home against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas won 27\u201326. [[Dez Bryant]] left the game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], Romo suffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and [[Brandon Weeden]] replaced him. Dallas won 20\u201310 to begin the season 2\u20130, but then went on a seven-game losing streak. Dallas finished the season 4\u201312 and last in their division.\n\n===2016===\n{{Main article|2016 Dallas Cowboys season}}\nAfter a preseason injury to [[Tony Romo]], rookie quarterback [[Dak Prescott]] was slated as the starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6\u20138 weeks. In game 1 against the [[New York Giants]], Dallas lost 20\u201319. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak. After much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo made an announcement that Prescott has earned the right to take over as Cowboys quarterback.\n\nIn game 10, Romo suited up for the first time this season and was the backup quarterback. Dallas defeated the [[Baltimore Ravens]] to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise record of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back [[Ezekiel Elliott]] breaking [[Tony Dorsett]]'s single season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Dan Marino]] by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13\u20133, tying their best 16-game regular season record. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at [[Lambeau Field]] in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the divisional round of the [[2016\u201317 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]] on a last-second field goal, ending their season.\n\nDak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4, 2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Both Prescott and Elliott made the [[2017 Pro Bowl]]. This is the first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys News: Dak Prescott And Ezekiel Elliott Headline Cowboys' Pro Bowl Selections - Blogging The Boys|url=https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2016/12/21/14029926/cowboys-news-notes-dak-and-zeke-headline-dallas-cowboys-pro-bowl-selections|website=Blogging the Boys (Dallas Cowboys blog)}}</ref>\n\n===2017===\n{{Main article|2017 Dallas Cowboys season}}\n2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who retired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys. The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season [[Dez Bryant]] was released after eight seasons in Dallas and [[Jason Witten]] retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] sports documentary series ''All or Nothing''. The series is produced by NFL Films.<ref>{{cite news|title='All or Nothing' series to showcase Cowboys' 2017 season|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000918226/article/all-or-nothing-series-to-showcase-cowboys-2017-season|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===Logo===\n[[File:Cowboys wordmark.svg|right|thumb|200px|The Cowboys' script logo.]]\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, representative of Texas as \"The Lone Star State\", is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border was added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' [[Arena Football League|AFL]] team, the [[Dallas Desperados]] that have a similar logo based on the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that help bring out the blue in the uniform.  The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe are on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms.

The Cowboys also include a unique, if subtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of [[Dymo]] tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of the stripe at the back of the helmet.\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet Front.jpg|Front of Dallas Cowboys helmet\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet Back.jpg|Back of Dallas Cowboys helmet\n</gallery>\n\n====Uniform history====\nWhen the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included a white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe down the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a small blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for away games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1960.jpg|circa 1960\u20131963\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1960.jpg|Blue home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1960.jpg|White away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1964 the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silverblue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964 the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain \"throwback\" days.\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform has seen little change to the present day.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Dallas Cowboys helmet 1964.jpg|circa 1964\u20131966\nImage:Cowboys white uniform 1964.jpg|White home uniforms\nImage:Cowboys blue uniform 1964.jpg|Blue away uniforms\n</gallery>\n\nThe only notable changes in the last 40 years were:\n* from 1970\u20131973 when the \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes\n* from 1982\u20131988 the pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n* the removal of the indented [[serif]]s on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n* In 1980 the blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964\u201379 version; from 1981\u20131994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe. The stripes on the sleeves and socks also used the same gray with white border scheme (sans navy pinstripe).\n* Player names on jersey backs, which appeared in 1970, were originally in block-letter style; from 1982 onward the names were slightly smaller and in footed, \"serif\" style.\n* the 1996 addition of the word \"Cowboys\" in the center of the neckline which lasted until 1998 on the white jersey but currently remains on the blue jersey.\n\nDuring the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets were temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary.\n\n[[File:Cowboys 75anniv throwback.png|thumb|right|130px|The \"throwback\" NFL 75th Anniversary uniform was introduced in 1994.]]\n\nIn 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994\u20131995 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960\u201363 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's ''Classic Throwback Weekend'' on Thanksgiving Day 2001\u20132003.\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960\u20131963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960\u20131963 uniform may also be used on other special occasion. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players will no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving, which has since become an annual tradition.<ref name=\"2013BlueJerseys\">{{cite web|last=Eatman|first=Nick|title=Cowboys To Wear Blue Jerseys At Home Thursday|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/article-NickEatman/Cowboys-To-Wear-Blue-Jerseys-At-Home-Thursday/9ed90bd1-5be2-4e84-92c8-6dd43ee6fe77|publisher=Dallas Cowboys|date=November 26, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131130025313/http://www.dallascowboys.com:80/news/article-NickEatman/Cowboys-To-Wear-Blue-Jerseys-At-Home-Thursday/9ed90bd1-5be2-4e84-92c8-6dd43ee6fe77|archivedate=November 27, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2015|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\">{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Cowboys will wear navy jerseys at home more often|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000814752/article/cowboys-will-wear-navy-jerseys-at-home-more-often|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\">{{cite news|last=DaSilva|first=Cameron|title=Here\u2019s the real reason behind the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 mismatched uniform colors|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dallas-cowboys-nfl-uniforms-mismatched-gray-blue-home-away-throwback-thanksgiving-changes-061317|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks.

According to Mike McCord, the Cowboys' equipment director, one of the reasons why the Cowboys started wearing white at home was because of the intense heat during Cowboys' home games at [[Texas Stadium]].<ref name=\"HanzusCowboys\" /><ref name=\"DaSilvaCowboys\" />\n\n[[File:Staubach and Lilly HOF jerseys.jpg|thumb|Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly jerseys shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.]]\n\nThroughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"[[sports-related curses|jinxed]]\" because the team often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew attention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lukas|first=Paul|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/071025|title=ESPN Page 2 \u2013 Uni Watch: How 'bout them Cowboys?|publisher=ESPN|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> However, the roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional playoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in what turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Dallas's lone victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the 1978 NFC Championship game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSince the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super Bowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will wear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes), Miami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot climates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing teams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys going with retro look|first=Charean|last=Williams| work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=November 22, 2001}}</ref> such as when the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hosted the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=William N.|title=EAGLES DEVISE COLOR SCHEME FOR COWBOYS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/sports/eagles-devise-color-scheme-for-cowboys.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1981|accessdate=December 10, 2016}}</ref> as well as their November 4, 2007 meeting.

Through the 2000 season, the Cowboys continued the usual practice of wearing white at home. In 2001, the Cowboys wore blue at home for the first time in years, but it was an older design of the blue jersey. Dallas would lose the game, but again wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and won. With the 2002 victory, it seems an exception the theory of the blue jersey jinx is invoked on Thanksgiving.\n\nThus, the Cowboys continued wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving from 2003\u20132006, however it was always an older-styled blue jersey. In 2007 and 2008, the Cowboys returned to wearing white at home for their Thanksgiving game. Since 2009, the Cowboys returned to wearing blue at home on Thanksgiving only. (From 2009\u20132012, the team again decided to go with an older-styled blue uniform as they had in previous years on Thanksgiving, and since 2013 have worn the newer-styled blue jersey.)\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Cowboys wore their [[Color Rush]] variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" jerseys for a Thanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Shannon|title=CowBuzz: Cowboys Unveil New ColorRush Uniform For Thanksgiving Day Game|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/2015/11/20/cowbuzz-cowboys-unveil-new-colorrush-uniform-thanksgiving-day-game|publisher=Dallas Cowboys|date=November 20, 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20151121180136/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/2015/11/20/cowbuzz-cowboys-unveil-new-colorrush-uniform-thanksgiving-day-game|archivedate=November 21, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2018|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n==Stadiums==\n\n===Cotton Bowl===\n{{Main article|Cotton Bowl (stadium)}}\n[[File:CottonBowl.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance of the Cotton Bowl]]\nThe Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in [[Fair Park]], site of the [[State Fair of Texas]]. Concerts or other events using a stage allow the playing field to be used for additional spectators. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] college football bowl game, for which the stadium is named. (Beginning with the January 2010 game, the Cotton Bowl Classic has been played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in Arlington.) The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to [[Texas Stadium]]. It is the only Cowboys stadium within the Dallas [[city limits]]. The Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|1966 NFL Championship]] at the Cotton Bowl.\n\n===Texas Stadium===\n{{Main article|Texas Stadium}}\n[[File:Texas Stadium.jpeg|thumb|right|The outside of Texas Stadium]]\nFor the majority of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in [[Irving, Texas]]. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35&nbsp;million and with a [[seating capacity]] of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], 33\u201324, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving.\n\nIn [[2009 NFL season|2009]], it was replaced as home of the Cowboys by [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]], which officially opened on May 27, 2009 in [[Arlington, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/cowboys/2009-09-17-cowboys-stadium-cover_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='This transcends football': 'Boys boast as new stadium shines | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | date=September 18, 2009 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> Texas Stadium was demolished by implosion on April 11, 2010.\n\n===AT&T Stadium===\n{{Main article|AT&T Stadium}}\n[[File:Cowboys Stadium field.jpg|thumb|right|AT&T Stadium during a game]]\nAT&T Stadium, previously named Cowboys Stadium, is a [[domed stadium]] with a retractable roof in [[Arlington, Texas]].

The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach [[Jeff Fisher]] informed the officials that the punt struck the [[scoreboard]]. (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines \u2014 hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.\n\nThe first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants.

Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As such, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the sport.\n\n===Washington Redskins===\n{{Main article|Cowboys\u2013Redskins rivalry}}\nThe Redskins and Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by ''Sports Illustrated'' the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in sports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed, due to a longstanding disagreement between Redskins owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Cowboys founder [[Clint Murchison Jr.]] over the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Preston's TV monopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26\u201314 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 116 regular season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 70\u201342\u20132, and the Redskins lead the all-time playoff series 2\u20130. The Cowboys currently have a 14\u20137 advantage over the Redskins at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over the Redskins for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, the Redskins have struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings.\n\n===Philadelphia Eagles===\n{{Main article|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe competition with Philadelphia has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 20\u20137. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach [[Buddy Ryan]]. Among these were the 1989 \"[[Bounty Bowl]]s\", in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker [[Luis Zendejas]] and [[Veterans Stadium]] fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game at Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless and possibly paralyzed on the field. In 2008 the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44\u20136. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78\u201330, including a 24\u20130 shutout in week 17. That three game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992\u20131995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. During the 2013 season Dallas won the first meeting 17\u20133 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in Philadelphia. They would meet again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback [[Tony Romo]] out with a season ending back injury which put backup [[Kyle Orton]] as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24\u201322 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road, with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33\u201310 win on [[National Football League on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38\u201327 in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clenched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 63\u201350.\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{main article|Cowboys\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nThe first game ever played between the Giants and Cowboys was a 31\u201331 tie on December 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961 and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]] and winning the first regular season game played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in 2009. Dallas currently leads the all-time series 65\u201346\u20132.<ref name=\"footballdb1\"/>\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main article|Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry}} \nThe two teams met in the first regular season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 35\u201328 loss to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]), the first-ever regular season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests.  The Steelers won [[Super Bowl X]] and [[Super Bowl XIII]]; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by [[Roger Staubach]], then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an [[onside kick]]. The Cowboys won [[Super Bowl XXX]] in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a \"flashy\" team with [[Roger Staubach]]'s aerial attack and the \"flex\" [[Doomsday Defense]]; while the Steelers were more of a [[blue-collar worker|\"blue-collar\"]] team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque [[Steel Curtain]] defense, a contrast that still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/articles/2008/12/06/sports/steelers/doc493b5cd78829a110461455.txt |title=Beaver County Times & Allegheny Times Online \u2013 Steelers |work=The Times |location=UK |date=2008-12-07 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels.

San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]]) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers (and the [[New England Patriots]]) are second all time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The 49ers lead the series all-time series with a record of 15\u201313\u20131.\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n{{main article|Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry}}\n\nThe Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry is rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the [[Green Bay Packers]].{{CN|date=June 2017}} It is one of the best known intra-conference [[National Football League rivalries|rivalry]] games in the NFL. The two teams do not play every year; instead, they play once every three years due to the NFL's rotating division schedules, or if the two teams finish in the same place in their respective divisions, they would play the ensuing season.

Instead, the team has a [[Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor|\"Ring of Honor\"]], which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at [[AT&T Stadium]] in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president. Although the team does not officially retire jersey numbers, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\", so it is uncommon to find any current players wearing the number of one of the '''\"Ring of Honor\"''' inductees. For instance, the jersey numbers of inductees Aikman (8), Staubach (12), Hayes and Smith (22), Irvin (88), and Lilly (74) were not worn during the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, number 88 was issued to rookie [[Dez Bryant]].\n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan.\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\nSome of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets\". The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.\n\nThe most recent inductees are defensive end [[Charles Haley]], offensive lineman [[Larry Allen]], and wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], who were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] on November 6, 2011, and safety [[Darren Woodson]], who was inducted on November 1, 2015.\n\n===All-time first-round draft picks===\n{{Main article|List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks}}\n\n==Head coaches and staff==\n\n===Head coaches===\n{{Main article|List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches}}\n\n===Current staff===\n{{Dallas Cowboys staff}}\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{see also|Dallas Cowboys Radio Network}}\nAs of 2010, the Cowboys' flagship radio station is [[KRLD-FM]]. [[Brad Sham]] is the team's longtime [[sports commentator|play-by-play voice]]. Working alongside him is former Cowboy quarterback [[Babe Laufenberg]], who returned in 2007 after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is [[KTVT]], the [[CBS]] owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included [[KVIL-FM]], [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], and [[KLUV-FM]]. Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show with late veteran sportscaster [[Frank Glieber]] and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for him and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\" at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with [[Bill Mercer]], famous for calling the ''Ice Bowl'' of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in the 1980s.

The [[American Football League|AFL]] Broncos played at the [[University of Denver]]'s [[DU Stadium|Hilltop Stadium]] from time to time, including the first-ever victory of an AFL team over an [[National Football League|NFL]] team: The Broncos beat the [[Detroit Lions]] on August 5, 1967, in a preseason game. The team has sold out every home game (including post-season games) since the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}, with the exception of two replacement games during the {{nfly|1987}} strike (but both were sold out before the strike).\n\nDuring home games, the attendance is announced to the crowd, along with the number of no-shows (the fans subsequently boo the no-shows). The fans are also known to chant \"IN-COM-PLETE!\" every time the visiting team throws an [[Forward pass|incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/footer/faq.html |title=FAQ |work=Denver Broncos}}</ref> The stadium's legendary home-field advantage is regarded as one of the best in the NFL, especially during the playoffs. The Broncos had the best home record in pro football over a 32-year span from 1974 to 2006 (191\u201365\u20131). Mile High Stadium was one of the NFL's loudest stadiums, with steel flooring instead of [[concrete]], which may have given the Broncos an advantage over opponents, plus the advantage of altitude conditioning for the Broncos. In {{nfly|2001}}, the team moved into [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], built next to the former site of the since-demolished Mile High Stadium. Sportswriter [[Woody Paige]], along with many of Denver's fans, however, often refuse to call the new stadium by its full name, preferring to use \"Mile High Stadium\" because of its storied history and sentimental import. Additionally, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' had an official policy of referring to the stadium as simply \"Mile High Stadium\" in protest, but dropped this policy in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/guide/guide-to-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/ |title=Guide To Sports Authority Field At Mile High |work=CBS Denver |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Invesco Field at Mile High.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|Sports Authority Field]] has been the Broncos' home since 2001]]\nPrior to the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|2011]] season, [[Englewood, Colorado]]-based [[Sports equipment|sporting goods]] [[retail]]er [[Sports Authority]] claimed the [[naming rights]] of Invesco Field, which became known as '''Sports Authority Field at Mile High'''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Gray|title=A New Home|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/A-New-Home/14d4a137-b809-4347-9eef-bfdf909b6106|publisher=Denver Broncos|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Broncos stadium renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2011/08/16/broncos-stadium-renamed-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}</ref> However, in the summer of 2016, Sports Authority went bankrupt, and the Broncos have been seeking a new corporate sponsor for their stadium ever since.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Worthington, Danika |author2=Wolfe, Cameron |title=Mile High Stadium will get a new naming sponsor after Sports Authority, Broncos chief says |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/07/27/sports-authority-logos-stripped-broncos/ |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe altitude has also been attributed as part of the team's home success.

There are many different [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s that might have inspired this. In Semitic, Ancient Greek and Latin, the letter represented {{IPA|/d/}}; in the [[Etruscan alphabet]] the letter was superfluous but still retained (see letter [[B]]). The equivalent [[Greek letter]] is Delta, [[Delta (letter)|\u0394]].\n\nThe [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) form of 'd' consists of a loop and a tall [[Vertical direction|vertical]] stroke. It developed by gradual variations on the majuscule (capital) form. In handwriting, it was common to start the arc to the left of the vertical stroke, resulting in a [[serif]] at the top of the arc. This serif was extended while the rest of the letter was reduced, resulting in an angled stroke and loop. The angled stroke slowly developed into a vertical  stroke.\n\n==Use in writing systems==\n[[File:Boundary stone on the Demeljoch - 2.jpg|thumb|The letter D, standing for \"Deutschland\" ([[German language|German]] for \"[[Germany]]\"), on a [[boundary stone]] at the border between Austria and Germany.]] \nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, and in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|d}} generally represents the [[voiced alveolar plosive|voiced alveolar]] or [[voiced dental plosive]] {{IPA|/d/}}.

It originally stood for the sound {{IPAslink|w}} but it has principally remained in use as a [[Greek numeral]] for [[6 (number)|6]]. Whereas it was originally called ''waw'' or ''wau'', its most common appellation in classical Greek is ''digamma''; as a numeral, it was called ''epis\u0113mon'' during the Byzantine era and is now known as ''[[stigma (letter)|stigma]]'' after the [[Greek ligature|Byzantine ligature]] combining \u03c3-\u03c4  as \u03db.\n\nDigamma or wau was part of the original archaic Greek alphabet as initially adopted from [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]. Like its model, Phoenician [[Waw (letter)|waw]], it represented the [[voiced labial-velar approximant]] {{IPA|/w/}} and stood in the 6th position in the alphabet between [[epsilon]] and [[zeta]]. It is the consonantal doublet of the vowel letter [[upsilon]] ({{IPA|/u/}}), which was also derived from waw but was placed at the end of the Greek alphabet. Digamma or wau is in turn the ancestor of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin letter]] [[F (letter)|F]]. As an alphabetic letter, it is attested in archaic and dialectal [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] [[inscription]]s until the classical period.\n\nThe shape of the letter went through a development from [[File:Greek Digamma oblique.svg|x16px]] through [[File:Greek Digamma 05.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Digamma angular.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 01.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 02.svg|x16px]] to [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 05.svg|x16px]] or [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 06.svg|x16px]], which at that point was conflated with the \u03c3-\u03c4 ligature [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 07.svg|x16px]]. In modern print, a distinction is made between the letter in its original alphabetic role as a consonant sign, which is rendered as \"\u03dc\" or its modern lowercase variant \"\u03dd\", and the numeric symbol, which is represented by \"\u03db\". In [[modern Greek]], this is often replaced by the digraph {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03c4}}.\n\n==Greek w==\n\n===Mycenaean Greek===\n[[File:Ceramic fragment with WANAKTI inscription.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Greek ceramic fragment depicting a horse with rider. The inscription reads [...]\u0399 \u03dc\u0391\u039d\u0391\u039a\u03a4\u0399 ([...]i wanakti), \"to the king\", with an initial digamma (and a [[Archaic Greek alphabets#Corinthian|local \u03a3-shaped form]] for [[iota]]).]]\n\nThe sound {{IPA|/w/}} existed in [[Mycenean Greek]], as attested in [[Linear B]] and archaic Greek inscriptions using digamma.  It is also confirmed by the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] name of [[Troy]], ''Wilusa'', corresponding to the Greek name *''Wilion''.\n\n===Classical Greek===\nThe {{IPAslink|w}} sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period.\n\nIn [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], {{IPAslink|w}} had probably disappeared before [[Homer]]'s epics were written down (7th century BC), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] defective. For example, the words [[Anax|\u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be]] \"[[tribal king|(tribal) king]], lord, (military) leader\".<ref>{{LSJ|a)/nac|\u1f04\u03bd\u03b1\u03be|ref}}.</ref> found in the [[Iliad]], would have originally been {{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03be}} {{IPA|/w\u00e1naks/}} (and is attested in this form in Mycenaean Greek<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Chadwick|Chadwick, John]]|title=The Decipherment of Linear B |publisher=Second edition (1990).

Further evidence coupled with cognate-analysis shows that {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} was earlier {{lang|grc|\u03dd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} {{IPA|/w\u00f3\u00eenos/}}<ref>{{LSJ|oi){{=}}nos1|\u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|ref}}:\n:\u03dc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 [[Gortyn code|Leg.Gort.]] [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main?url=oi%3Fikey%3D200508 col X.39]</ref> (cf. [[Classical crete|Cretan]] [[Doric Greek|Doric]] ''ib\u00eana'', cf. [[Latin]] ''v\u012bnum'' and [[English language|English]] \"wine\"). There have been editions of the Homeric epics where the wau was re-added, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but these have largely fallen out of favour.\n\n[[Aeolic Greek|Aeolian]] was the dialect that kept the sound {{IPAslink|w}} longest. In discussions by ancient Greek grammarians of the Hellenistic era, the letter is therefore often described as a characteristic Aeolian feature.\n\nLoanwords that entered Greek before the loss of {{IPA|/w-/}} lost that sound when Greek did. For instance, [[Oscan]] ''Viteliu'' (\"land of the male calves\", compare {{lang-la|vitulus}} \"yearling, male calf\") gave rise to the Greek word ''Italia''. The Adriatic tribe of the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] was called in {{lang-grc|\u1f18\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af|Enetoi}}. In loanwords that entered the Greek language after the drop of {{IPAslink|w}}, the phoneme was once again registered, compare for example the spelling of {{lang|grc|\u039f\u1f50\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} for ''[[vates]]''.\n\n===Pamphylian digamma===\n[[File:Greek Sigma 01.svg|thumb|right|100px|Pamphylian digamma]]\nIn some local (''epichoric'') alphabets, a variant glyph of the letter digamma existed that resembled modern Cyrillic [[\u0418]]. In one local alphabet, that of [[Pamphylia]], this variant form existed side by side with standard digamma as two distinct letters. It has been surmised that in this dialect the sound {{IPAslink|w}} may have changed to labiodental {{IPAslink|v}} in some environments. The F-shaped letter may have stood for the new {{IPAslink|v}} sound, while the special \u0418-shaped form signified those positions where the old {{IPAslink|w}}  sound was preserved.<ref>Nick Nicholas: [http://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/epigraphical.pdf Proposal to add Greek epigraphical letters to the UCS]. Technical report, Unicode Consortium, 2005. Citing C. Brixhe, ''Le dialecte grec de Pamphylie. Documents et grammaire''. Paris: Maisonneuve, 1976.</ref>\n\n==Numeral==\nDigamma/wau remained in use in the system of [[Greek numerals]] attributed to [[Miletus]], where it stood for the number 6, reflecting its original place in the sequence of the alphabet. It was one of three letters that were kept in this way in addition to the 24 letters of the classical alphabet, the other two being [[koppa (letter)|koppa]] (\u03d9) for 90, and [[sampi]] (\u03e1) for 900. During their history in handwriting in late antiquity and the Byzantine era, all three of these symbols underwent several changes in shape, with digamma ultimately taking the form of \"\u03db\". It has remained in use as a numeral in Greek to the present day, in contexts such as enumerating chapters in a book or other items in a set.\n\n==Glyph development==\n[[File:NAMA Alphabet grec.jpg|thumb|The alphabet on a [[black figure]] vessel, with a square-C digamma.]]\n\n===Epigraphy===\nDigamma was derived from Phoenician waw, which was shaped roughly like an Y ([[File:Phoenician waw.svg|x14px]]). Of the two Greek reflexes of waw, digamma retained the alphabetic position, but had its shape modified to [[File:Greek Digamma oblique.svg|x16px]], while the [[upsilon]] retained the original shape but was placed in a new alphabetic position. Early Crete had an archaic form of digamma somewhat closer to the original Phoenician, [[File:Greek Digamma 02.svg|x16px]], or a variant with the stem bent sidewards ([[File:Greek Digamma 09.svg|x16px]]). The shape [[File:Greek Digamma oblique.svg|x16px]], during the archaic period, underwent a development parallel to that of [[epsilon]] (which changed from [[File:Greek Epsilon archaic.svg|x16px]] to \"E\", with the arms becoming orthogonal and the lower end of the stem being shed off). For digamma, this led to the two main variants of classical \"F\" and square [[File:Greek Digamma angular.svg|x16px]].<ref name=\"jeffery\">{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Lilian H.|title=The local scripts of archaic Greece|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon|year=1961|pages=24f.}}</ref>\n\nThe latter of these two shapes became dominant when used as a numeral, with \"F\" only very rarely employed in this function. However, in Athens, both of these were avoided in favour of a number of alternative numeral shapes ([[File:Greek Digamma numeric 01.svg|x16px|\u03dc]], [[File:Greek Digamma numeric 02.svg|x16px|\u03dc]], [[File:Greek Digamma numeric 03.svg|x16px|\u03dc]], [[File:Greek Digamma numeric 04.svg|x16px|\u03dc]], [[File:Greek Digamma numeric 05.svg|x16px|5]], [[File:Greek Digamma numeric 06.svg|x16px|6]]).<ref name=\"tod\">{{cite journal|last=Tod|first=Marcus N.|title=The alphabetic numeral system in Attica|journal=Annual of the British School at Athens|volume=45|year=1950|pages=126\u2013139|doi=10.1017/s0068245400006730}}</ref>\n\n=== Early handwriting ===\n[[File:666.jpg|thumb|right|A fragment of [[Papyrus 115]], showing the number \"{{overline|{{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03b9\u03db}}}}\" (616, the \"[[Number of the Beast]]\"), with a C-shaped digamma.]]\n\nIn cursive handwriting, the square-C form developed further into a rounded form resembling a \"C\" (found in papyrus manuscripts as [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 01.svg|x16px]], on coins sometimes as [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 08.svg|x16px]]). It then developed a downward tail at the end ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 02.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Digamma cursive 03.svg|x16px]]) and finally adopted a shape like a Latin \"s\" ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 05.svg|x16px]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardthausen|first=Victor Emil|authorlink=Victor Gardthausen|title=Griechische Palaeographie, Vol. 2|place=Leipzig|publisher=B.G.

Appleton|year=1893|page=104}}</ref> The \u03c3\u03c4-ligature had become common in [[minuscule Greek|minuscule]] handwriting from the 9th century onwards. Both closed ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 07.svg|x16px]]) and open ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 04.svg|x16px]]) forms were subsequently used without distinction both for the ligature and for the numeral. The ligature took on the name of \"''stigma''\" or \"''sti''\", and the name stigma is today applied to it both in its textual and in the numeral function. The association between its two functions as a numeral and as a sign for \"st\" became so strong that in modern typographic practice in Greece, whenever the \u03db\u02b9 sign itself is not available, the letter sequences \u03c3\u03c4\u02b9 or \u03a3\u03a4\u02b9 are used instead for the number 6.\n\n=== Typography ===\nIn western typesetting during the modern era, the numeral symbol was routinely represented by the same character as the ''stigma'' ligature (\u03db). In normal text, this ligature together with numerous others continued to be used widely until the early nineteenth century, following the style of earlier minuscule handwriting, but ligatures then gradually dropped out of use. The ''stigma'' ligature was among those that survived longest, but it too became obsolete in print after the mid-19th century. Today it is used only to represent the numeric digamma, and never to represent the sequence \u03c3\u03c4 in text.\n\nAlong with the other special numeric symbols koppa and sampi, numeric digamma/stigma normally has no distinction between uppercase and lowercase forms,<ref name=\"holton\">{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Holton|first2=Peter|last2=Mackridge|first3=Irene|last3=Philippaki-Warburton|title=Greek: a comprehensive grammar of the modern language|place=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=105|isbn=0-415-10001-1}}</ref> (while other alphabetic letters can be used as numerals in both cases). Distinct uppercase versions were occasionally used in the 19th century. Several different shapes of uppercase stigma can be found, with the lower end either styled as a small curved S-like hook ([[File:Greek Stigma uc S-shaped.svg|x16px]]), or as a straight stem, the latter either with a serif ([[File:Greek Koppa-Stigma uc.svg|x16px]]) or without one ([[File:Greek Koppa-Stigma uc 2.svg|x16px]]). An alternative uppercase stylization in some twentieth-century fonts is [[File:Greek Stigma uc ST.svg|x16px]], visually a ligature of Roman-style uppercase C and T.\n\nThe characters used for numeric digamma/stigma are distinguished in modern print from the character used to represent the ancient alphabetic digamma, the letter for the [w] sound. This is rendered in print by a Latin \"F\", or sometimes a variant of it specially designed to fit in typographically with Greek (<span style=\"font-family:serif\">\u03dc</span>). It has a modern lowercase form (<span style=\"font-family:serif\">\u03dd</span>) that typically differs from Latin \"f\" by having two parallel horizontal strokes like the uppercase character, with the vertical stem often being somewhat slanted to the right or curved, and usually descending below the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]]. This character is used in Greek [[epigraphy]] to transcribe the text of ancient inscriptions that contain \"\u03dc\", and in linguistics and historical grammar when describing reconstructed proto-forms of Greek words that contained the sound /w/.\n\n==Glyph confusion==\n[[File:Greek capital numerals 01.svg|thumb|right|Example of a nineteenth-century font using S-shaped capital Stigma (first row) and G-shaped capital Koppa (second row).]]\n[[File:Greek capital numerals 02.svg|thumb|right|Example of a nineteenth-century font using turned-lamedh-shaped capital Koppa and G-shaped capital Stigma.]]\n[[File:Greek Stigma and Koppa font design.svg|thumb|right|Stigma and Koppa in modern fonts.]]\n\nThroughout much of its history, the shape of digamma/stigma has often been very similar to that of other symbols, with which it can easily be confused. In ancient papyri, the cursive C-shaped form of numeric digamma is often indistinguishable from the C-shaped (\"lunate\") form that was then the common form of [[sigma]]. The similarity is still found today, since both the modern stigma (\u03db) and modern final sigma (\u03c2) look identical or almost identical in most fonts; both are historically continuations of their ancient C-shaped forms with the addition of the same downward flourish. If the two characters are distinguished in print, the top loop of stigma tends to be somewhat larger and to extend farther to the right than that of final sigma. The two characters are, however, always distinguishable from the context in modern usage, both in numeric notation and in text: the final form of sigma never occurs in numerals (the number 200 being always written with the medial sigma, \u03c3), and in normal Greek text the sequence \"\u03c3\u03c4\" can never occur word-finally.\n\nThe medieval s-like shape of digamma ([[File:Greek Digamma cursive 05.svg|x16px]]) has the same shape as a contemporary abbreviation for {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76}} (\"and\").\n\nYet another case of glyph confusion exists in the printed uppercase forms, this time between stigma and the other numeral, [[koppa (letter)|koppa]] (90). In ancient and medieval handwriting, koppa developed from [[File:Greek Koppa normal.svg|x16px]] through [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 01.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 02.svg|x16px]], [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 03.svg|x16px]] to [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 04.svg|x16px]]. The uppercase forms [[File:Greek Koppa-Stigma uc.svg|x16px]] and [[File:Greek Koppa-Stigma uc 2.svg|x16px]] can represent either koppa or stigma. Frequent confusion between these two values in contemporary printing was already noted by some commentators in the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"\">{{cite book|last=Adelung|first=Johann Christoph|title=Neues Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der Diplomatik, Vol.2|place=Erfurt|year=1761|page=137f.}}</ref> The ambiguity continues in modern fonts, many of which continue to have glyph similar to [[File:Greek Koppa-Stigma uc.svg|x16px]] for either koppa or stigma.\n\n==Names==\nThe symbol has been called by a variety of different names, referring either to its alphabetic or its numeral function or both.\n\n===Wau===\n''Wau'' (variously rendered as ''vau'', ''waw'' or similarly in English) is the original name of the alphabetic letter for {{IPAslink|w}} in ancient Greek.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roger D.|last=Woodard|chapter=Phoinikeia grammata: an alphabet for the Greek language|title=A companion to the ancient Greek language|editor-first=Egbert J.|editor-last=Bakker|place=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2010|page=30f. |isbn=978-1-4051-5326-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Lilian H.|title=The local scripts of archaic Greece|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon|year=1961|page=24f.}}</ref> It is often cited in its reconstructed [[acrophonic]] spelling \"{{lang|el|\u03dd\u03b1\u1fe6}}\". This form itself is not historically attested in Greek inscriptions, but the existence of the name can be inferred from descriptions by contemporary Latin grammarians, who render it as ''vav''.<ref>Cf. ''Grammatici Latini'' (ed. Keil), 7.148.</ref> In later Greek, where both the letter and the sound it represented had become inaccessible, the name is rendered as {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03b1\u1fe6}} or {{lang|el|\u03bf\u1f50\u03b1\u1fe6}}. In the 19th century, the anglicized form ''vau'' was a common name for the symbol \u03db in its numerical function, used by authors who distinguished it both from the alphabetic \"digamma\" and from \u03db as a \u03c3\u03c4 ligature.<ref>{{cite book|title=Buttmann's larger Greek grammar: a Greek grammar for use of high schools and universities|first=Philipp|last=Buttmann|year=1839|place=New York|page=22}}</ref>\n\n===Digamma===\nThe name ''digamma'' was used in ancient Greek and is the most common name for the letter in its alphabetic function today. It literally means \"double [[gamma]]\" and is descriptive of the original letter's shape.\n\n===Episemon===\nThe name ''epis\u0113mon'' was used for the numeral symbol during the Byzantine era and is still sometimes used today, either as a name specifically for digamma/stigma, or as a generic term for the whole group of extra-alphabetic numeral signs (digamma, [[koppa (letter)|koppa]] and [[sampi]]). The Greek word \"{{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}}\", from {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af-}} (''epi-'', \"on\") and {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1}} (''s\u0113ma'', \"sign\"), literally means \"a distinguishing mark\", \"a badge\", but is also the neuter form of the related adjective \"{{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}\" (\"distinguished\", \"remarkable\"). This word was connected to the number \"six\" through early Christian mystical [[numerology]]. According to an account of the teachings of the heretic [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] given by the church father [[Irenaeus]], the number six was regarded as a symbol of Christ, and was hence called \"{{lang|grc|\u1f41 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2}}\" (\"the outstanding number\"); likewise, the name {{lang|grc|\u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} (''Jesus''), having six letters, was \"{{lang|grc|\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1}}\" (\"the outstanding name\"), and so on. The sixth-century treatise ''[[About the Mystery of the Letters]]'', which also links the six to Christ, calls the number sign ''to Epis\u0113mon'' throughout.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bandt|first=Cordula|title=Der Traktat \"Vom Mysterium der Buchstaben.\" Kritischer Text mit Einf\u00fchrung, \u00dcbersetzung und Kommentar|place=Berlin|publisher=de Gruyter|year=2007}}</ref> The same name is still found in a fifteenth-century arithmetical manual by the Greek mathematician [[Nikolaos Rabdas]].<ref name=\"einarson\">{{cite journal|last=Einarson|first=Benedict|title=Notes on the development of the Greek alphabet|journal=Classical Philology|volume=62|year=1967|pages=1\u201324; especially p.13 and 22|doi=10.1086/365183}}</ref> It is also found in a number of western European accounts of the Greek alphabet written in Latin during the early Middle Ages.

Many early plots revolved around Dilbert's engineer nature or his bizarre inventions. Also prominent were plots based on Dogbert's [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacal]] ambitions. Later, the location of most of the action moved to Dilbert's workplace and the strip started to satirize technology, workplace, and company issues. The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which are familiar to a large and appreciative audience;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/10/how-dilbert-practically-wrote-itself/ |title=How \"Dilbert\" Practically Wrote Itself |last1=Ennes |first1=Meghan |date=2013-10-18 |website=hbr.org |publisher=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2014-10-28}}</ref> Adams has said that switching the setting from Dilbert's home to his office was \"when the strip really started to take off\".<ref>{{Cite web|author=Adams, Scott|title=The Loser Decision|publisher=The Dilbert blog|date=2007-07-23|url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/the-loser-decis.html}}</ref> The workplace location is [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>{{Cite comic| Cartoonist = [[Scott Adams|Adams, Scott]]|story=Sunday, September 09, 2012|title = Dilbert|Date = 2012-09-09|publisher = Universal UClick|url = http://dilbert.com/strip/2012-09-09}}</ref>\n\n''Dilbert'' portrays corporate culture as a [[Franz Kafka#.22Kafkaesque.22|Kafkaesque]] world of [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake and office politics that stand in the way of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and [[busy work]] is praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to [[management|mismanagement]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Dilbert characters}}\n{{Duplication|section|date=December 2016}}\n\n=== Dilbert ===\n{{Main|Dilbert (character)}}\nThe main character in the strip, Dilbert is a stereotypical technically-minded single male. Until October 2014, he was usually depicted wearing a white dress shirt, black trousers and a red-and-black striped tie that inexplicably curves upward; after October 13, 2014, his standard apparel changed to a red polo shirt with a name badge on a lanyard around his neck.<ref>http://dilbert.com/strip/2014-10-13</ref> Dilbert is a skilled engineer but has a poor social and romantic life.\n\n=== Pointy-haired Boss ===\n{{Main|Pointy-haired Boss}}\nThe unnamed, oblivious manager of the engineering division of Dilbert's company. Scott Adams states that he never named him so that people can imagine him to be their boss. In earlier strips he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls; it was not until later that he developed his signature \"pointy hair\" and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his lack of skills with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies that rarely bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues, but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that \"He's not sadistic, just uncaring\". His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named \"Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light\", and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devils' horns.\n\n=== Wally ===\n{{Main|Wally (Dilbert)}}\nOne of the longest serving engineers, Wally was originally a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it even in the midst of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy-haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. Adams has stated that Wally was based on a Pacific Bell coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program\u2014for the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man\u2014whom Adams describes as \"one of the more brilliant people I've met\"\u2014to work hard at being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him.\n\n=== Alice ===\n{{Main|Alice (Dilbert)}}\nOne of the more competent and highest paid engineers. She is often frustrated at her work, because she does not get proper recognition, which she believes is because she is female, though in reality it is likely because she has a quick, often violent temper, sometimes putting her \"Fist of Death\" to use, even with the Pointy-haired Boss. Alice is based on a woman that Scott Adams worked with named Anita, who is described as sharing Alice's \"pink suit, fluffy hair, technical proficiency, coffee obsession, and take-no-crap attitude.\"\n\n=== Dogbert ===\n{{Main|Dogbert}}\nDilbert's anthropomorphic pet dog is the smartest dog on Earth. Dogbert is a megalomaniac intellectual dog, planning to one day conquer the world. He once succeeded, but became bored with the ensuing peace, and quit. Often seen in high-ranking consultant or technical support jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company, though considering the intelligence of the company's management in general and Dilbert's boss in particular, this is not very hard to do. He also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting and usually dull customers to steal their money. However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he has been known to pull his master out of some tight jams. Dogbert's nature as a pet was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common, although he still wags his tail when he perpetrates his scams. When an older Dilbert arrives while time-traveling from the future, he refers to Dogbert as \"majesty\", indicating that Dogbert will one day indeed rule the world ... again, and make worshipping him retroactive so he could boss around time travelers.\n\n=== Catbert ===\n{{Main|Catbert}}\n'''Catbert''' is the \"evil director of [[human resources]]\" in the ''Dilbert'' comic strip. He was supposed to be a one-time character but resonated with readers so well that Adams brought him back as the HR director. Catbert's origins with the company are that he was hired by Dogbert. Dogbert hired him because he wanted an H.R. Director that appeared cute while secretly downsizing you.\n\n=== Asok ===\n{{Main|Asok (Dilbert)}}\nA young intern, he works very hard but does not always get proper recognition. Asok is intensely intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his optimistic illusions becomes frequent comic fodder. He is Indian, and has graduated from the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IIT). The other workers, especially the boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs. On the occasions when Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored. His test scores (a perfect 1600 on the old SAT) and his IQ of 240 show that he is the smartest member of the engineering team. Nonetheless he is often called upon by the Boss to do odd jobs, and in meetings his ideas are usually left hanging. He is also seen regularly at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, experiencing jarring realizations of the nature of corporate life. There are a few jokes about his psychic powers, which he learned at the IIT. Yet despite his intelligence, ethics and mystical powers, Asok sometimes takes advice from Wally in the arts of laziness, and from Dilbert in surviving the office. As of February 7, 2014, Asok is officially gay, which never affects any storylines, but merely commemorates a decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold an anti-gay law.<ref name=\"SHYAMANTHA\">{{cite news|last=Shyamantha|first=Asokan|title=India's Supreme Court turns the clock back with gay sex ban|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/us-india-rights-gay-idUSBRE9BA05620131211|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2014-02-07/</ref>\n\n=== Ted ===\nAn engineer who is often seen hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, but he is still seen occasionally. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed down a flight of stairs and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and children who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as ''Ted the Generic Guy'', because whenever he needs to fire or kill someone he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.\n\n===Elbonia===\nElbonia is a non-specific under-developed country used when Adams wants \"to involve a foreign country without hurting overseas sales\". He says \"People think I have some specific country in mind when I write about Elbonia, but I don't. It represents the view that Americans have of any country that doesn't have cable television&nbsp;\u2014 we think they all wear fur hats and wallow around waist-deep in mud\".<ref>Seven years of Defective People\"&nbsp;\u2014 page 184, \"Elbonians\"</ref> The entire country wears the same clothing and hats, and all men have full beards. They are occasionally bitter towards their wealthier western neighbors, but are quite happy to trade with them. The whole country is covered in mud, and has limited technology.\n\nElbonia is located somewhere in the former Soviet bloc: A strip dated April 2, 1990, refers to the \"Tiny East European country of Elbonia.\"<ref>[http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1990-04-02/ Dilbert.com]</ref> It is an extremely poor, [[Least Developed Countries|fourth-world]] country that has abandoned [[Communism]].<ref>[http://www.dilbert.com/fast/1990-04-02/ Dilbet.com]</ref> The national [[bird]] of Elbonia is the [[Frisbee]].<ref>[http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1991-10-14/ Dilbert.com]</ref>\n\n===Phil===\nHis full title is Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light & Supreme Ruler of Heck. The Pointy-Haired Boss's brother Phil, has the job of being one step down from Satan. His job is to punish those who commit minor sins, and his 'Pitch-Spoon' is feared by those who do. He is known to 'Darn to Heck' people who do things like using cell phones in the bathroom, steal office supplies, or those who simply do something annoying. In one strip, it was mentioned that being in Heck is not as bad as being in a cubicle.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe popularity of the comic strip within the corporate sector has led to the Dilbert character being used in many business magazines and publications, including several appearances on the cover of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]''. Many newspapers run the comic in their business section rather than in the regular comics section (similar to the way that ''[[Doonesbury]]'' is often featured in the editorial section, due to its pointed commentary).{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Criticism and parody===\nMedia analyst [[Norman Solomon]] and cartoonist [[Tom Tomorrow]] claim<ref>{{cite web|url=http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/ |title=The Trouble With Dilbert: The Book |publisher=Web.archive.org |access-date=2009-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040218235653/http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/ |archivedate = 2004-02-18}}</ref> that Adams's caricatures of corporate culture seem to project empathy for white-collar workers, but the satire ultimately plays into the hands of upper corporate management itself. Solomon describes the characters of ''Dilbert'' as dysfunctional time-wasters, none of whom occupies a position higher than middle management, and whose inefficiencies detract from corporate values such as 'productivity' and 'growth'<!-- -the following clause removed for lack of sense:, a very favorable outlook for managers- -->. Dilbert and his office-mates often find themselves baffled or victimized by the whims of managerial behavior, but they never seem to question it openly. Solomon cites the [[Xerox]] corporation's use of ''Dilbert'' strips and characters in internally distributed 'inspirational' pamphlets:\n\n{{quote|style=font-size: 100%;|text=Xerox management had recognized what more gullible ''Dilbert'' readers did not: ''Dilbert'' is an offbeat sugary substance that helps the corporate medicine go down. The ''Dilbert'' phenomenon accepts&nbsp;\u2014 and perversely eggs on&nbsp;\u2014many negative aspects of corporate existence as unchangeable facets of human nature&nbsp; ... As Xerox managers grasped, ''Dilbert'' speaks to some very real work experiences while simultaneously eroding inclinations to fight for better working conditions.}}\n\nAdams responded in the February 2, 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-02-02/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for February 2, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |access-date=2013-06-30}}</ref> strip and in his book ''The Joy of Work'', simply by restating Solomon's argument, apparently suggesting that it was absurd and required no rebuttal.\n\nIn 1997, [[Tom Vanderbilt]] wrote in a similar vein in ''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine:\n\n{{quote|style=font-size: 100%;|text=Labor unions haven't adopted ''Dilbert'' characters as insignia. But corporations in droves have rushed to link themselves with ''Dilbert''. Why? ''Dilbert'' mirrors the mass media's crocodile tears for working people&nbsp;\u2014 and echoes the ambient noises from Wall Street.}}\n\nIn 1998, [[Bill Griffith]], creator of ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'', chided Dilbert for crude drawings and simplistic humor. He wrote, \n\n<blockquote>Long since psychically kidnapped by the gaudy, mindlessly hyperactive world of television, (readers) no longer demand or expect comic strips to be compelling, challenging, or even interesting. Enter '[[Cathy]]'. And 'Dilbert.' Sure, comics are still funny. It's just that the humor has almost no 'nutritional' value. In the tiny space allotted to them, daily strips have all too successfully adapted to their new environment. In this Darwinian set-up, what thrives are simply drawn panels , minimal dialogue, and a lot of head-and-shoulder shots. Anything more complicated is deemed 'too hard to read.' A full, rich drawing style is a drawback. Simplicity, even crudity, rules.<ref>Griffith, Bill (November 10, 1996) [http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaarticles.html \"Comics at 100.\"] Articles by Bill Griffith. (Retrieved 9-12-2016.)</ref></blockquote> \n\nAdams lashed back with a comic strip called ''Pippy the Ziphead'', \"cramming as much artwork in as possible so no one will notice there's only one joke ...

This soon became a regular feature in the ''Savage Dragon'' comic book, titled ''The Savage Dragonbert and Hitler's Brainbert'' (\"Hitler's Brainbert\" being a loose parody of both Dogbert and the ''Savage Dragon'' villain identified as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s disembodied, superpowered brain). The strip began as a specific parody of the comic book itself, set loosely within the office structure of ''Dilbert'', with H\u00f6rnell doing an emulation of Adams's cartooning style.<ref name=\"dragon\" />\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|Language}} ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\nAdams has invented words that have become popular among fans in describing their own office environments, such as \"''Induhvidual''\". This term is based on the [[American English]] slang expression \"[[wikt:duh|duh]]!\" The conscious misspelling of ''individual'' as ''induhvidual'' is a pejorative term for people who are not in [[Dogbert's New Ruling Class]] (DNRC). Its coining is explained in ''Dilbert Newsletter'' #6. The strip has also popularized the usage of the terms \"cow-orker\" and [[Pointy-haired Boss|PHB]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Management===\nIn 1997, Scott Adams masqueraded as a management consultant to [[Logitech]] executives (as Ray Mebert), with the cooperation of the company's vice-chairman. He acted in much the way that he portrays management consultants in the comic strip, with an arrogant manner and bizarre suggestions, such as comparing [[Strategic planning#Mission statements and vision statements|mission statement]]s to broccoli soup. He convinced the executives to change their existing mission statement for their New Ventures Group from \"provide Logitech with profitable growth and related new business areas\" to \"scout profitable growth opportunities in relationships, both internally and externally, in emerging, mission-inclusive markets, and explore new paradigms and then filter and communicate and evangelize the findings\".<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971116&slug=2572663 ''Dilbert Creator Fools Execs With Soap Story'', [[Associated Press]], from the Web page of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', November 16, 1997.]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000914093255/http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/humor/scott-adams-mgmt-consultant ''Dilbert Creator Fools Executives'', AP story, in full, preserved on [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] humor bulletin board, November 15, 1997.

In 2001, he collaborated with design company [[IDEO]] to come up with the \"perfect cubicle\", a fitting creation since many of the ''Dilbert'' strips make fun of the standard [[Cubicle|cubicle desk]] and the environment that it creates. The result was both whimsical and practical.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Porter Anderson |title=Fred Dust: Designing for Dilbert |publisher=CNN Career |date=2001-08-28 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.fred.dust.focus/index.html |access-date=2007-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429114333/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.fred.dust.focus/index.html |archivedate=April 29, 2007 |df=mdy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Porter Anderson|title=Scott Adams: Dilbert's Ultimate Cubicle|publisher=CNN Career|date=2001-08-28|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.scott.adams/index.html|access-date=2007-03-10}}</ref>\n\nThis project was followed in 2004 with designs for [https://web.archive.org/web/20041001095014/http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/duh/index.html Dilbert's Ultimate House] (abbreviated as DUH). An energy-efficient building was the result, designed to prevent many of the little problems that seem to creep into a normal building. For instance, to save time spent buying and decorating a [[Christmas tree]] every year, the house has a large (yet unapparent) closet adjacent to the living room where the tree can be stored from year to year.\n\n===Webcomics===\nIn 1995, ''Dilbert'' was the [[List of early webcomics|first]] syndicated comic strip to be published for free on the [[Internet]].

The series ran for two seasons from January 25, 1999 to July 25, 2000. The first season centered around the creation of a new product called the \"Gruntmaster 6000\". It was critically acclaimed and won a Golden Globe award, leading to its renewal for a second season. The second season did away with the serial format and was composed entirely of standalone episodes, many of which shifted focus away from the workplace and involved absurdist plots such as Wally being mistaken for a religious leader (\"[[Dilbert (TV series)#Episodes|The Shroud of Wally]]\") and Dilbert being accused of mass murder (\"[[Dilbert (TV series)#Episodes|The Trial]]\"). Critical and fan reception was resoundingly negative to the change in format and storytelling, and the series was not renewed for a third season. The second season two-episode finale included Dilbert getting pregnant with the child of a cow, a [[hillbilly]], [[robot]] DNA, \"several dozen engineers\", an elderly billionaire, and an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], eventually ending up in a custody battle with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] as the Judge.\n\n===New animation===\nOn April 7, 2008, dilbert.com presented its first Dilbert animation. The new Dilbert animations are animated versions of original comic strips produced by [[RingTales]] and animated by [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]]. The animation videos run for around 30 seconds each and are added every weekday. On December 10, 2009 the RingTales produced animations were made available as a calendar application for mobile devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dilbert Animated Calendar |url=http://www.metranome.net/calendars.php |date=2009-12-10 |access-date=2009-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723205352/http://www.metranome.net/calendars.php |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df=mdy}}</ref>\n\n==\"Drunken lemurs\" case==\nIn October 2007, the Catfish Bend Casino in [[Burlington, Iowa]] notified its staff that the casino was closing and they were going to be [[layoff|laid off]].

In other words, it is not an actual [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the \"standard language\" or dominant language, but rather a separate, independently evolved but often distantly related language.<ref name=maiden>{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=dialects+of+italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \"dialect\", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of [[Prestige (linguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political status, [[official language|official status]], predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, under this usage, the \"dialects\" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often loosely related) languages in and of themselves. Thus, these \"dialects\" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|family]] or subfamily as the standard language and may even, to varying degrees, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standard language and instead may better fit the criteria of a separate language.\n\nFor example, most of the various regional [[Romance language|Romance]] [[languages of Italy]], often colloquially referred to as Italian \"dialects\", are, in fact, not ''actually'' derived from modern [[standard Italian]], but rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now [[Italy]]. These various Latin-derived regional languages are, therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\" or varieties of the [[standard Italian|standard Italian language]], but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, regional versions or varieties of standard Italian have developed, generally as a mix of national standard Italian with a [[substratum]] of local regional languages and local accents. While [[dialect levelling|\"dialect\" levelling]] has increased the number of standard Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian particular to their region. These variations on standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called \"dialects\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \"dialect\", as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.<ref>{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}</ref><ref name=maiden/><ref name=repetti>{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&printsec=frontcover&dq=dialects+of+italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&q=dialects%20of%20italy&f=false|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be preferred over ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].\n\n==Standard and non-standard dialect==\nA ''standard dialect'' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or \"[[standard language]]\") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the \"correct\" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].\n\nA [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and [[Syntax|syntax]], but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English| Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.\n\n== Dialect or language ==\n{{see also|Abstand and ausbau languages|A language is a dialect with an army and navy}}\nThere is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.<ref>Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). \"Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'.\" ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331\u2013359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.</ref> A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends upon the user's frame of reference. For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Lim\u00f3n Creole English]] should be considered \"a kind\" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.\n\nThe most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case, the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. The mutual intelligibility criterion also flounders in cases in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa.\n\n=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===\n[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.<ref>{{cite book\n  | surname1 = Chambers | given1 = J.

According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.\nThus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.\nIn contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].\nSimilarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.\n\nWithin this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{cite book\n  | first = William A. | last = Stewart | author-link = William Alexander Stewart\n  | chapter = A sociolinguistic typology for describing national multilingualism\n  | pages = 531\u2013545 | doi = 10.1515/9783110805376.531\n  | editor-first = Joshua A. | editor-last = Fishman\n  | title = Readings in the Sociology of Language\n  | publisher = De Gruyter | year = 1968\n  | isbn = 978-3-11-080537-6\n}} p. 535.</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | chapter = Introduction | pages = 1\u201318\n  | first1 = Charles A. | last1 = Ferguson | author-link1 = Charles A.

As a result of this, in some contexts, the term \"dialect\" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of \"dialect\", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':\n* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,\n* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),\n* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,\n* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.\n\nThe status of \"language\" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.\n\nModern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between \"language\" and \"dialect\" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate \"language\" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate \"people\", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a \"dialect\" tends to be seen not as \"a people\" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.\n\nThe [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|\"\u05d0\u05b7 \u05e9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05b7\u05da \u05d0\u05d9\u05d6 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d3\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05e2\u05e7\u05d8 \u05de\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d0\u05b7\u05df \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05de\u05f2 \u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e4\u05bf\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05d8\"}}: \"[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]\") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question \"what is a language?\" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.\n\n==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===\n\nBy the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a \"dialect\" of ''some'' language\u2014\"everybody speaks a dialect\". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.\n\nThe terms \"language\" and \"dialect\" are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement \"the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]\".\n\nThere are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is \"[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]\";<ref name=finegan>{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}</ref>  \"[[lect]]\" is another.  A more general term is \"languoid\", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.<ref>[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid \"Languoid\"] at ''Glottopedia.com''</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages \u00a7 Language vs. dialect}}\n\n=== German ===\nWhen talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.\n\nThe German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.\n\nThe situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.\n\nThe [[Low German]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].\n\nThe [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.\n\n===Italian===\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\nItaly is home to a vast array of [[Languages of Italy|native regional minority languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Romance]]-based and have their own local variants. These [[regional language]]s are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian \"dialects\", or ''dialetti'' (standard Italian for \"dialects\"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually \"dialects\" of [[standard Italian]] in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern [[standard Italian]] but instead evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as \"standard Italian.\" They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than \"dialects.\"\n\nIn addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the [[Latin]]-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true \"dialects\" due to the often high degree in which they lack [[mutual intelligibility]]. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely [[standard Italian]] speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure [[Sicilian language]] variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a [[Gallo-Italic]] language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[French language|French]] speaker than with a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related [[Neapolitan language]], but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the [[Sicily|same island]] as the Sicilian language.\n\nModern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]]. The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread throughout Italy among the educated upper class through the works of authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], and [[Petrarch]]. Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus slowly became the language of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.\n\nDuring the [[Risorgimento]], proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]]. With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate \"dialects\" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism. However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved. Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region. However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.\n\nItalians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or [[regional Italian|regional Italian dialects]], which, unlike the majority of [[languages of Italy]], are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages. A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.\n\nThe languages of Italy are primarily [[Latin]]-based [[Romance languages]], with the most widely spoken languages falling within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]] family. This wide category includes:\n*Standard Italian and [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]; \n*the various related [[Central Italian]] dialects, such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]];\n*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] group (also known as \"Southern Italian\"), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]];\n*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] group, including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]]. \nThe [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]] is considered significantly influenced by both the Neapolitan and Sicilian language groups.\n\nThe [[Sardinian language]] is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from Italian and the wider Italo-Dalmatian family but basal to all other romance families. It is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Campidanese]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects. The [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-related [[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] which are also spoken in [[Sardinia]], on the other hand, are often considered closely related to or derived from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and are therefore fully part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages. Furthermore, the [[Gallo-Romance]] language of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect]] are also spoken in Sardinia, respectively in [[Carloforte]]/[[Calasetta]] and [[Alghero]].\n\nAside from the more common [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance language]]s in Italy, other native languages in Italy include: \n*a variety of [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Gallo-Rhaetian languages]], [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (such as [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Friulian]], the [[Lombard language]]s, [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]], the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.); \n*[[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages, such as the [[Cimbrian language]]s, [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[M\u00f2cheno language]];\n*the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arb\u00ebresh language]]; \n*the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]];\n*the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]]; and \n*various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]].\n\n=== The Balkans ===\nThe classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and [[American English]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as \"languages\" or \"dialects\" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as varieties of a single language, whereas the national standards of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which are closer to each other than some local vernacular dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]] are to themselves, differing to a similar extent as the formal varieties of English, are treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language article]] deals with this topic much more fully.)\n\nSimilar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]], is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.\n\n===Lebanon===\nIn [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers \"[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]\" to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.\n\n===North Africa===\nIn Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.\n\n===Ukraine===\nThe [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.\n\nFollowing the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the ukrainization in the early 1290s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of ukrainization, and the opposite process of russification started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.\n\nToday the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine.\n\n===Moldova===\nThere have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of \"Romanian expansionism\", rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan\u2013Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion B\u0103rbu\u0163\u0103, described the dictionary as a politically motivated \"absurdity\".\n\n===Greater China===\n{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}\nUnlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].\n\n== Historical linguistics ==\n{{Empty section|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Interlingua ==\n\n{{Main|Interlingua}}\n\nOne language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.<ref name=\"coljld\">[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}.

The flowers are produced on a tall spike, are tubular, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white, and yellow. The best-known species is the common foxglove, ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]''. This biennial plant is often grown as an [[ornamental plant]] due to its vivid flowers which range in colour from various purple tints through pink, light grey, and purely white. The flowers can also possess various marks and spottings. The first year of growth produces only the stem with its long, basal leaves. During the second year of the plant's life, a long, leafy stem from 50 to 255 centimetres tall grows atop the roots of healthy plants.\n\nOther garden-worthy species include ''D. ferruginea'', ''D. grandiflora'', ''D. lutea'' and ''D. parviflora''.<ref name=AZEGP>{{cite book\n| editor-last = Brickell\n| editor-first = Christopher\n| title = The Royal Horticultural Society A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants\n| year = 2008\n| page = 377\n| publisher = Dorling Kindersley\n| location = United Kingdom\n| ISBN = 9781405332965}}</ref>\n\n[[Larva]]e of the [[foxglove pug]], a moth, consume the flowers of the common foxglove for food.

Hollman A. ''BMJ'' 1996;312:912. online version accessed 18 October 2006 [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7035/912]</ref> It is used to increase cardiac contractility (it is a positive [[inotrope]]) and as an [[antiarrhythmic agent]] to control the heart rate, particularly in the irregular (and often fast) [[atrial fibrillation]]. Digitalis is hence often prescribed for patients in atrial fibrillation, especially if they have been diagnosed with [[congestive heart failure]]. Digoxin was approved for heart failure in 1998 under current regulations by the Food and Drug Administration on the basis of prospective, randomized study and clinical trials. It was also approved for the control of ventricular response rate for patients with atrial fibrillation. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend digoxin for symptomatic chronic heart failure for patients with reduced systolic function, preservation of systolic function, and/or rate control for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Heart Failure Society of America guidelines for heart failure provide similar recommendations. Despite its relatively recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration and the guideline recommendations, the therapeutic use of digoxin is declining in patients with heart failure\u2014likely the result of several factors. Safety concerns regarding a proposed link between digoxin therapy and increased mortality in women may be contributing to the decline in therapeutic use of digoxin.\n\n===Variations===\n[[File:Foxglove - Digitalis purpurea.jpg|thumb|Digitalis purpurea -- light purple]]\nA group of pharmacologically active compounds are extracted mostly from the leaves of the second year's growth, and in pure form are referred to by common chemical names, such as [[digitoxin]] or [[digoxin]], or by brand names such as Crystodigin and Lanoxin, respectively. The two drugs differ in that digoxin has an additional [[hydroxyl]] group at the C-3 position on the B-ring (adjacent to the pentane). Both molecules include a [[lactone]] and a triple-repeating [[sugar]] called a [[glycoside]].\n\n===Mechanism of action===\nDigitalis works by inhibiting [[sodium-potassium ATPase]]. This results in an increased intracellular concentration of [[sodium]] ions and thus a decreased concentration gradient across the cell membrane. This increase in intracellular sodium causes the Na/Ca exchanger to reverse potential, i.e., transition from pumping sodium into the cell in exchange for pumping calcium out of the cell, to pumping sodium out of the cell in exchange for pumping calcium into the cell. This leads to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which improves cardiac contractility. Under normal physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic calcium used in cardiac contractions originates from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an intracellular organelle that specializes in the storage of calcium. Human newborns, some animals, and patients with chronic heart failure lack well developed and fully functioning sarcoplasmic reticula and must rely on the Na/Ca exchanger to provide all or a majority of the cytoplasmic calcium required for cardiac contraction. For this to occur, cytoplasmic sodium must exceed its typical concentration to favor a reversal in potential, which naturally occurs in human newborns and some animals primarily through an elevated heart rate; in patients with chronic heart failure it occurs through the administration of digitalis. As a result of increased contractility, [[stroke volume]] is increased. Ultimately, digitalis increases cardiac output (Cardiac Output=Stroke Volume x Heart Rate). This is the mechanism that makes this drug a popular treatment for congestive heart failure, which is characterized by low cardiac output.\nDigitalis also has a vagal effect on the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], and as such is used in re-entrant [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and to slow the ventricular rate during [[atrial fibrillation]]. The dependence on the vagal effect means digitalis is not effective when a patient has a high [[sympathetic nervous system]] drive, which is the case with acutely ill persons, and also during exercise.\n\n==Toxicity==\n{{Main|Digoxin poisoning}}\n[[Image:Digitalis purpurea Koehler drawing.jpg|thumb|right|''Digitalis purpurea'' drawings by [[K\u00f6hler's Medicinal Plants|Franz K\u00f6hler]]]]\n\nDigitalis toxicity (also known as digitalis intoxication and digitalism) results from an overdose of digitalis and causes [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], as well as sometimes resulting in [[xanthopsia]] (jaundiced or yellow vision) and the appearance of blurred outlines (halos), drooling, abnormal heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, weakness, collapse, dilated pupils, tremors, seizures, and even death. [[Bradycardia]] also occurs. Because a frequent side effect of digitalis is reduction of appetite, some individuals have used the drug as a weight-loss aid.\n\nDigitalis is an example of a drug derived from a plant that was formerly used by [[folklorist]]s and [[herbalist]]s; herbalists have largely abandoned its use because of its narrow [[therapeutic index]] and the difficulty of determining the amount of active drug in herbal preparations. Once the usefulness of digitalis in regulating the human [[pulse]] was understood, it was employed for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and other seizure disorders, which are now considered to be inappropriate treatments.\n\nDepending on the species, the digitalis plant may contain several deadly physiological and chemically related cardiac and steroidal glycosides. Thus, the digitalis plants have earned several, more sinister, names: dead man\u2019s bells and witch's gloves.\n\nThe entire plant is toxic (including the roots and seeds). Mortality is rare, but case reports do exist. Most plant exposures occur in children younger than six years and are usually unintentional and without associated significant toxicity. More serious toxicity occurs with intentional ingestions by adolescents and adults.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/816781-overview#a0199 |title=Cardiac Glycoside Plant Poisoning: Medscape reference|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref> Early symptoms of ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wild hallucinations, [[delirium]], and severe headache. Depending on the severity of the toxicosis, the victim may later suffer irregular and slow pulse, [[tremor]]s, various cerebral disturbances, especially of a visual nature (unusual colour visions (see [[xanthopsia]]) with objects appearing yellowish to green, and blue halos around lights), [[convulsions]], and deadly disturbances of the heart.

There can be as many as 15,000 spines per cell, each of which serves as a postsynaptic process for individual presynaptic axons.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=C.|author2=Zador, A.|title=The Function of Dendritic Spines: Devices Subserving Biochemical Rather Than Electrical Compartmentalization|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=February 1993|volume=13|issue=2|pages=413\u2013422|pmid=8426220}}</ref> Dendritic branching can be extensive and in some cases is sufficient to receive as many as 100,000 inputs to a single neuron.<ref name=\"Alberts 2009\"/>\n\nDendrites are one of two types of protoplasmic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the other type being an axon. Axons can be distinguished from dendrites by several features including shape, length, and function. Dendrites often taper off in shape and are shorter, while axons tend to maintain a constant radius and be relatively long. Typically, axons transmit electrochemical signals and dendrites receive the electrochemical signals, although some types of neurons in certain species lack axons and simply transmit signals via their dendrites.<ref name=Yau /> Dendrites provide an enlarged surface area to receive signals from the terminal buttons of other axons, and the axon also commonly divides at its far end into many branches ([[Axon#Axon terminals|telodendria]]) each of which ends in a nerve terminal, allowing a chemical signal to pass simultaneously to many target cells.<ref name=\"Alberts 2009\">{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2009|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8153-4129-1|edition=3rd}}</ref> Typically, when an electrochemical signal stimulates a neuron, it occurs at a dendrite and causes changes in the electrical potential across the neuron\u2019s plasma membrane. This change in the membrane potential will passively spread across the dendrite but becomes weaker with distance without an [[action potential]]. An action potential propagates the electrical activity along the membrane of the neuron's dendrites to the cell body and then afferently down the length of the axon to the axon terminal, where it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.<ref name=\"Alberts 2009\"/> However, synapses involving dendrites can also be axodendritic, involving an axon signaling to a dendrite, or [[Dendrodendritic synapse|dendrodendritic]], involving signaling between dendrites.<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\">{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Physiology of Behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|edition=11th}}</ref> An [[autapse]] is a synapse in which the axon of one neuron transmits signals to its own dendrites.\n\nThere are three main types of neurons; multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar. Multipolar neurons, such as the one shown in the image, are composed of one axon and many dendritic trees. Pyramidal cells are multipolar cortical neurons with pyramid shaped cell bodies and large dendrites called apical dendrites that extend to the surface of the cortex. Bipolar neurons have one axon and one dendritic tree at opposing ends of the cell body. Unipolar neurons have a stalk that extends from the cell body that separates into two branches with one containing the dendrites and the other with the terminal buttons.

Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963. The formulas detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser\u2013Huxley equations.

One theory on the mechanism of dendritic arbor development is the Synaptotropic Hypothesis.

A balance between metabolic costs of dendritic elaboration and the need to cover receptive field presumably determine the size and shape of dendrites. A complex array of extracellular and intracellular cues modulates dendrite development including transcription factors, receptor-ligand interactions, various signaling pathways, local translational machinery, cytoskeletal elements, Golgi outposts and endosomes. These contribute to the organization of the dendrites on individual cell bodies and the placement of these dendrites in the neuronal circuitry. For example, it was shown that \u03b2-actin zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) contributes to proper dendritic branching. Other important transcription factors involved in the morphology of dendrites include CUT, Abrupt, Collier, Spineless, ACJ6/drifter, CREST, NEUROD1, CREB, NEUROG2 etc. Secreted proteins and cell surface receptors includes neurotrophins and tyrosine kinase receptors, BMP7, Wnt/dishevelled, EPHB 1-3, Semaphorin/plexin-neuropilin, slit-robo, netrin-frazzled, reelin. Rac, CDC42 and RhoA serve as cytoskeletal regulators and the motor protein includes KIF5, dynein, LIS1. Important secretory and endocytic pathways controlling the dendritic development include DAR3 /SAR1, DAR2/Sec23, DAR6/Rab1 etc. All these molecules interplay with each other in controlling dendritic morphogenesis including the acquisition of type specific dendritic arborization, the regulation of dendrite size and the organization of dendrites emanating from different neurons.<ref name=urbanska /><ref name=perycz />\n\n==Electrical properties==\nThe structure and branching of a neuron's dendrites, as well as the availability and variation of [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated ion conductance]], strongly influences how the neuron integrates the input from other neurons. This integration is both temporal, involving the summation of stimuli that arrive in rapid succession, as well as spatial, entailing the aggregation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from separate branches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kandel|first=Eric R.|title=Principles of neural science.|date=2003|publisher=McGrawHill|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-8385-7701-6|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\nDendrites were once thought to merely convey electrical stimulation passively. This passive transmission means that [[voltage]] changes measured at the cell body are the result of activation of distal synapses propagating the electric signal towards the cell body without the aid of [[voltage-gated ion channels]]. [[Cable theory|Passive cable theory]] describes how voltage changes at a particular location on a dendrite transmit this electrical signal through a system of converging dendrite segments of different diameters, lengths, and electrical properties. Based on passive cable theory one can track how changes in a neuron\u2019s dendritic morphology impacts the membrane voltage at the cell body, and thus how variation in dendrite architectures affects the overall output characteristics of the neuron.<ref name=\"Koch 1999\">{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Christof|title=Biophysics of computation : information processing in single neurons|date=1999|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Each ion species has its own corresponding protein channel located in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. The cell membrane of neurons covers the axons, cell body, dendrites, etc. The protein channels can differ between chemical species in the amount of required activation voltage and the activation duration.<ref name=\"Alberts 2009\"/>\n\nAction potentials in animal cells are generated by either sodium-gated or calcium-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane. These channels are closed when the membrane potential is near to, or at, the resting potential of the cell. The channels will start to open if the membrane potential increases, allowing sodium or calcium ions to flow into the cell. As more ions enter the cell, the membrane potential continues to rise. The process continues until all of the ion channels are open, causing a rapid increase in the membrane potential that then triggers the decrease in the membrane potential. The depolarizing is caused by the closing of the ion channels that prevent sodium ions from entering the neuron, and they are then actively transported out of the cell. Potassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward flow of potassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting potential. After an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift, called the afterhyperpolarization or refractory period, due to additional potassium currents. This is the mechanism that prevents an action potential from traveling back the way it just came.<ref name=\"Alberts 2009\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=MW|author2=Larkman, PM|title=The action potential.|journal=Practical Neurology|date=Jun 2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=192\u20137|pmid=17515599}}</ref>\n\nAnother important feature of dendrites, endowed by their active voltage gated conductance, is their ability to send action potentials back into the dendritic arbor. Known as [[Neural backpropagation|back-propagating]] action potentials, these signals depolarize the dendritic arbor and provide a crucial component toward synapse modulation and [[long-term potentiation]]. Furthermore, a train of back-propagating action potentials artificially generated at the soma can induce a calcium action potential (a [[dendritic spike]]) at the dendritic initiation zone in certain types of neurons.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Plasticity==\nDendrites themselves appear to be capable of [[synaptic plasticity|plastic changes]] during the adult life of animals, including invertebrates. Neuronal dendrites have various compartments known as functional units that are able to compute incoming stimuli. These functional units are involved in processing input and are composed of the subdomains of dendrites such as spines, branches, or groupings of branches. Therefore, plasticity that leads to changes in the dendrite structure will affect communication and processing in the cell. During development dendrite morphology is shaped by intrinsic programs within the cell's genome and extrinsic factors such as signals from other cells. But in adult life, extrinsic signals become more influential and cause more significant changes in dendrite structure compared to intrinsic signals during development. In females, the dendritic structure can change as a result of physiological conditions induced by hormones during periods such as pregnancy, lactation, and following the estrous cycle. This is particularly visible in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the density of dendrites can vary up to 30%.<ref name=Tavosanis />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=perycz>{{Cite journal | last1 = Perycz | first1 = M. | last2 = Urbanska | first2 = A.

This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />\n\nIn fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the B\u00f6npos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.<ref name=SK /> Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the \"''Desi''\" or \"Viceroy\", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs.

The following year their forces approached [[Amdo]] on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchurian, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\">{{cite book |author=\u9648\u5e86\u82f1 |title=\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u8f6c\u4e16\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5b9a\u5236\u82f1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e |ISBN = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41\u2013}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation\".

For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan\". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nIn the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />\n\n==== Cultural development ====\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84\u20135.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />\n\n==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" />\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== 6th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683\u20131706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245\u2013256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 109\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's intereference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an imposter set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260\u2013271.</ref><ref name=\"HarperCollins\">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>\n\nHaving discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an imposter, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumoured to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognise [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognise him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name=\"HarperCollins\" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgement of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing.

After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.276-281\">Mullin 2001, p. 276\u2013281.</ref> The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars.

By the end of the year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them.

On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287\u20139.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes.

This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\n==== Return to Lhasa ====\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130\u2013132.</ref>\n\n==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as G\u00fcshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership.

According to Mullin, the [[Fourteenth Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]].

This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328\u2013332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333\u20134.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59\u201360}}}}\n\nThubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':\n{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311\u2013312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}\n\nAccording to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, which is quite possible, it would more likely to have been in order to protect or enhance their personal family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could have also easily died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting him from nearby countries for personal blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343\u20136.</ref>\n\nTibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, \"''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''\". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.\n\nFinally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"''Even today''\" he is quoted as saying, \"''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>\n\n==== 9th Dalai Lama ====\nBorn in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346\u20138.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name=\"Wang\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_p71\">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 348.</ref> In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.</ref><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 71.</ref> but in 1815 a British scientist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa.

After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters.

He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367\u2013373.</ref>\n\nHis minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188\u20139.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />\n\nIn 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />\n\nAccording to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />\n\nIn any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"he suddenly became ill and passed away\".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373\u2013375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>\n\n=== 13th Dalai Lama ===\n[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return.

Due to his two periods of exile in 1904\u20131909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] \u2013 rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}\n\nThe Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[\u00dc-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet.

In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of ''Marpori'' ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site. This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Songtsen Gampo]] for his Nepalese wife.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 112\u2013113.</ref> Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where [[Tsongkhapa]] had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s.

Both palaces are in Lhasa and approximately 3&nbsp;km apart.\n\nFollowing the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge in India. Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] allowed in the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government officials. The Dalai Lama has since lived in exile in [[McLeod Ganj]], in the Kangra district of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in northern India, where the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] is also established. His residence on the Temple Road in McLeod Ganj is called the Dalai Lama Temple and is visited by people from across the globe.

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the [[Nechung Oracle]], a search for the Lama's ''yangsi'', or [[reincarnation]], is conducted. Traditionally, it has been the responsibility of the High Lamas of the [[Gelug]]pa tradition and the Tibetan government to find a person accepted as his reincarnation. The process can take around two or three years to identify the Dalai Lama, and for the 14th, [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], it was four years before he was found. Historically, the search for the Dalai Lama has usually been limited to Tibet, though the third tulku was born in Mongolia. Tenzin Gyatso, however, has stated that he will not be reborn in the People's Republic of China, though he has also suggested he may not be reborn at all, suggesting the function of the Dalai Lama may be outdated.<ref name=\"sdpcnw\">{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/dalailama_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-05-17|date=2006-09-21}}</ref> The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=China's Tensions With Dalai Lama Spill into the Afterlife|author=Buckley, Chris|date=11 March 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/asia/chinas-tensions-with-dalai-lama-spill-into-the-afterlife.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news}}</ref>\n\nThe High Lamas used several ways in which they can increase the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit [[Lhamo La-tso]], a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.\nIt is said that [[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake Lhamo La-tso promised Gendun Drup, the 1st Dalai Lama, in one of his visions \"that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas.\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 265.</ref> Ever since the time of Gendun Gyatso, the 2nd Dalai Lama, who formalised the system, the Regents and other monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 139, 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nThe particular form of Palden Lhamo at Lhamo La-tso is Gyelmo Maksorma, \"The Victorious One who Turns Back Enemies\". The lake is sometimes referred to as \"Pelden Lhamo Kalideva\", which has been taken as a reason to claim that Palden Lhamo is an emanation of the goddess [[Kali]], the [[shakti]] of the [[Hindu]] God [[Shiva]].<ref>Dowman 1988, p. 260.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Lhamo Latso ...

Special damages basically include  compensatory damages for the injury or harm to the plaintiff that result from the tort committed by the defendant.\n\nDamages in tort are awarded generally to place the claimant in the position in which he would have been had the tort not taken place.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=John C.P.|title=Two Conceptions of Tort Damages: Fair v. Full Compensation|journal=DePaul Law Review|date=2005|volume=55|page=435|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/deplr55&div=20&id=&page=|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> Damages for breach of contract are generally awarded to place the claimant in the position in which he would have been had the contract not been breached. This can often result in a different measure of damages. In cases where it is possible to frame a claim in either contract or tort, it is necessary to be aware of what gives the best outcome.\n\nIf the transaction was a \"good bargain,\" contract generally gives a better result for the claimant.\n\nAs an example, Neal agrees to sell Mary an antique Rolex for \u00a3100. In fact the watch is a fake and worth only \u00a350. If it had been a genuine antique Rolex, it would have been worth \u00a3500. Neal is in breach of contract and could be sued. In contract, Mary is entitled to an item worth \u00a3500, but she has only one worth \u00a350. Her damages are \u00a3450. Neal also induced Mary to enter into the contract through a misrepresentation (a tort). If Mary sues in tort, she is entitled to damages that put herself back to the same financial position place she would have been in had the misrepresentation not been made. She would clearly not have entered into the contract knowing the watch was fake, and is entitled to her \u00a3100 back. Thus her damages in tort are \u00a3100. (However, she would have to return the watch, or else her damages would be \u00a350.)\n\nIf the transaction were a \"bad bargain\", tort gives a better result for the claimant. If in the above example Mary had overpaid, paying \u00a3750 for the watch, her damages in contract would still be \u00a3450 (giving her the item she contracted to buy), however in tort damages are \u00a3700. This is because damages in tort put her in the position she would have been in had the tort not taken place, and are calculated as her money back (\u00a3750) less the value of what she actually got (\u00a350).\n\n====Incidental and consequential losses====\n\nSpecial damages are sometimes divided into [[incidental damages]], and [[consequential damages]].\n\nIncidental losses include the costs needed to remedy problems and put things right. The largest element is likely to be the reinstatement of property damage. Take for example a factory which was burnt down by the negligence of a contractor. The claimant would be entitled to the direct costs required to rebuild the factory and replace the damaged machinery.\n\nThe claimant may also be entitled to any consequential losses. These may include the lost profits that the claimant could have been expected to make in the period whilst the factory was closed and rebuilt.\n\n====Breach of contract duty - (ex contract)====\nOn a breach of contract by a defendant, a court generally awards the sum that would restore the injured party to the economic position they expected from performance of the promise or promises (known as an \"[[Expectation damages|expectation measure]]\" or \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" measure of damages). This rule, however, has attracted increasing scrutiny from Australian courts and legal commentators.<ref name=\"Tabcorp v Bowen Investments\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|8|2009|litigants=Tabcorp Holdings Ltd v Bowen Investments Pty Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref name=\"Clark v Macourt\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|93|2013|litigants=Clark v Macourt |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Winterton |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2014/27.html#fn4 |title=Clark v Macourt: Defective Sperm and Performance Substitutes in the High Court of Australia}} (2014) 38(2) Melbourne University Law Review 755.</ref>\n\nWhen it is either not possible or not desirable to award the victim in that way, a court may award money damages designed to restore the injured party to the economic position s/he occupied at the time the contract was entered (known as the \"[[Reliance damages (law)|reliance measure]]\")<ref name=\"McRae v Commonwealth\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|79|1951|litigants=[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.pdf (1951) 84 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 377] |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref name=\"Commonwealth v Amann Aviation\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|54|1991|litigants=[[Commonwealth v Amann Aviation]] |parallelcite=(1991) 174 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 64 |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> or designed to prevent the breaching party from being unjustly enriched (\"restitution\") (see below).\n\nParties may contract for [[liquidated damages]] to be paid upon a breach of the contract by one of the parties.

Damages in [[tort]] are quantified under two headings: general damages and special damages.\n\nIn personal injury claims, damages for compensation are quantified by reference to the severity of the injuries sustained (see below general damages for more details). In non-personal injury claims, for instance, a claim for professional negligence against solicitors, the measure of damages will be assessed by the loss suffered by the client due to the negligent act or omission by the solicitor giving rise to the loss. The loss must be reasonably foreseeable and not too [[Remoteness in English Law|remote]]. Financial losses are usually simple to quantify but in complex cases which involve loss of pension entitlements and future loss projections, the instructing solicitor will usually employ a specialist expert actuary or accountant to assist with the quantification of the loss.\n\n===General damages===\n''General damages'' compensate the claimant for the non-monetary aspects of the specific harm suffered. This is usually termed 'pain, suffering and loss of amenity'. Examples of this include physical or emotional pain and suffering, loss of companionship, [[loss of consortium]], disfigurement, loss of reputation, loss or impairment of mental or physical capacity, hedonic damages or loss of enjoyment of life, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://d-w-s.co.uk/content/personal-injury-loss-amenity-compensation |location=Leicester |work=Douglas Wemyss Solicitors |title=Loss of Amenity |first=Richard |last=Beaman |date=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115095301/http://d-w-s.co.uk/content/personal-injury-loss-amenity-compensation |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}</ref> This is not easily quantifiable, and depends on the individual circumstances of the claimant. Judges in the United Kingdom base the award on damages awarded in similar previous cases.\n\nGeneral damages are generally awarded only in claims brought by individuals, when they have suffered personal harm. Examples would be personal injury (following the tort of negligence by the defendant), or the tort of defamation.\n\n===Speculative damages===\n[[Speculative damages]] are damages that have not yet occurred, but the plaintiff expects them to. Typically, these damages cannot be recovered unless the plaintiff can prove that they are reasonably likely to occur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speculative Damages|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/speculative_damages|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory damages ==\n[[Statutory damages]] are an amount stipulated within the statute rather than calculated based on the degree of harm to the plaintiff. Lawmakers will provide for statutory damages for acts in which it is difficult to determine the value of the harm to the victim. Mere violation of the law can entitle the victim to a statutory award, even if no actual injury occurred. These are different from nominal damages, in which no written sum is specified.\n\n== Nominal damages ==\n\nNominal damages are very small damages awarded to show that the loss or harm suffered was technical rather than actual. Perhaps the most famous nominal damages award in modern times has been the $1 verdict against the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in the [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|1986 antitrust suit]] prosecuted by the [[United States Football League]]. Although the verdict was automatically [[Treble damages|trebled]] pursuant to [[antitrust law in the United States]], the resulting $3 judgment was regarded as a victory for the NFL. Historically, one of the best known nominal damage awards was the [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] that the [[jury]] awarded to [[James McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]] in his libel suit against [[John Ruskin]]. In the English jurisdiction, nominal damages are generally fixed at \u00a32.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMany times a party that has been wronged but is not able to prove significant damages will sue for nominal damages. This is particularly common in cases involving alleged violations of constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech.\n\n=== Contemptuous damages ===\n\nContemptuous damages are a form of damage award available in some jurisdictions. They are similar to nominal damages awards, as they are given when the plaintiff's suit is trivial, used only to settle a point of honour or law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contemptuous damages|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095634713|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> Awards are usually of the smallest amount, usually 1 cent or similar. The key distinction is that in jurisdictions that follow the loser-pays for attorney fees, the claimant in a contemptuous damages case may be required to pay his or her own attorney fees.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oliphant|first1=Ken|last2=Lunney|first2=Mark|title=Tort Law: Text and Materials|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0199211361|page=865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9bUUcu9c7LcC}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the court awarded the smallest coin in the Realm, which in England was one farthing, 1/960 of a pound before decimalisation in the 1970s.

An Introduction to Canadian Tort Law|year=1974|publisher=Pitman|location=Toronto|isbn=0-273-04189-4|page=219|chapter=Civil Court Procedure And Remedies For Tort}}</ref>\n\n== Punitive damages (non-compensatory) ==\n{{Main|Punitive damages}}\n\nGenerally, '''punitive damages''', which are also termed ''exemplary damages'' in the [[United Kingdom]], are not awarded in order to compensate the plaintiff, but in order to reform or deter the defendant and similar persons from pursuing a course of action such as that which damaged the plaintiff. Punitive damages are awarded only in special cases where conduct was egregiously insidious and are over and above the amount of compensatory damages, such as in the event of [[Malice (law)|malice]] or [[intent (law)|intent]]. Great judicial restraint is expected to be exercised in their application. In the United States punitive damages awards are subject to the limitations imposed by the [[due process of law]] clauses of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]].\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], exemplary damages are limited to the circumstances set out by [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] in the leading case of ''[[Rookes v. Barnard]]''. They are:\n\n#Oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional actions by the servants of government.\n#Where the defendant's conduct was 'calculated' to make a profit for himself.\n#Where a statute expressly authorises the same.\n\n[[Rookes v Barnard]] has been much criticised and has not been followed in [[Canada]] or [[Australia]] or by the [[Privy Council]].\n\nPunitive damages awarded in a US case would be difficult to get recognition for in a European court, where punitive damages are most likely to be considered to violate ordre public.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Koziol|first1=Helmut|last2=Wilcox|first2=Vanessa|title=3709109647|date=2011|publisher=Springer Vienna|isbn=3709109647|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZlWtQAACAAJ|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Aggravated damages ===\n\nSome jurisdictions recognize a form of damages, called, aggravated damages, that are similar to punitive or exemplary damages. Aggravated damages are not often awarded; they apply where the injury has been aggravated by the wrongdoer's behaviour, for example, their cruelty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Behand|first=Nadine|title=How To Run Your Own Court Case|year=2009|publisher=Redfern Legal Centre|location=Sydney|isbn=978-1-921410-83-3|page=145}}</ref>\n\n== Restitutionary or disgorgement damages ==\n\nIn certain areas of the law another head of damages has long been available, whereby the defendant is made to give up the profits made through the civil wrong in [[restitution]]. Doyle and Wright define restitutionary damages as being a monetary remedy that is measured according to the defendant's gain rather than the plaintiff's loss.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Doyle, S |author2=Wright, D |title=Restitutionary damages - the unnecessary remedy |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2001/1.html}} (2001) 25(1) Melbourne University Law Review 1.</ref> The plaintiff thereby gains damages which are not measured by reference to any loss sustained. In some areas of the law this heading of damages is uncontroversial; most particularly [[intellectual property]] rights and breach of fiduciary relationship.\n\nIn England and Wales the [[House of Lords]] case of ''Attorney-General v. Blake'' opened up the possibility of restitutionary damages for breach of contract. In this case the profits made by a defecting spy, [[George Blake]], for the publication of his book, were awarded to the British Government for breach of contract. The case has been followed in English courts, but the situations in which restitutionary damages will be available remain unclear.\n\nThe basis for restitutionary damages is much debated, but is usually seen as based on denying a wrongdoer any profit from his wrongdoing. The really difficult question, and one which is currently unanswered, relates to what wrongs should allow this remedy.\n\n==Legal costs==\n{{See also|American rule (attorney's fees)|English rule (attorney's fees)}}\nIn addition to damages, the successful party is entitled to be awarded their reasonable [[legal costs]] that they spent during the case. This is the rule in most countries other than the United States.  In the United States, a party generally is not entitled to its [[attorneys' fees]] or for hardships undergone during trial unless the parties agreed in a contract that attorney's fees should be covered or a specific statute or law permits recovery of legal fees, such as [[discrimination]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Remedies for Employment Discrimination | url = http://eeoc.gov/employees/remedies.cfm | accessdate = July 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Damages in personal injury cases ==\n{{globalize|section|date=June 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2010}}\nThe quantification of personal injury is not an exact science. In English law solicitors like to call personal injury claims as \"general damages\" for pain and suffering and loss of amenity (PSLA). Solicitors quantify personal injury claims by reference to previous awards made by the courts which are \"similar\" to the case in hand. The guidance solicitors will take into account to help quantify general damages are as hereunder:\n\n===The age of the client===\n\nThe age of the client is important especially when dealing with fatal accident claims or permanent injuries. The younger the injured victim with a permanent injury the longer that person has to live with the PSLA. As a consequence, the greater the compensation payment. In fatal accident claims, generally the younger deceased, the greater the dependency claim by the partner and children.\n\n===The nature and extent of the injuries sustained===\n\nSolicitors will consider \"like for like\" injuries with the case in hand and similar cases decided by the courts previously. These cases are known as precedents. Generally speaking decisions from the higher courts will bind the lower courts. Therefore, judgments from the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal have greater authority than the lower courts such as the High Court and the County Court. A compensation award can only be right or wrong with reference to that specific judgment. Solicitors must be careful when looking at older cases when quantifying a claim to ensure that the award is brought up to date and to take into account the court of appeal case in [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2000/84.html Heil v Rankin]<ref>{{cite BAILII | litigants = Heil v Rankin & Another | link =  | country =  | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2000 | num = 84 | para =  | eucase =  | parallelcite =  | date =  | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}</ref> Generally speaking the greater the injury the greater the damages awarded.\n\n===Personal attributes and fortitude of the client===\n\nThis heading is inextricably linked with the other points above. Where two clients are of the same age, experience and suffer the same injury, it does not necessarily mean that they will be affected the same. We are all different. Some people will recover more quickly than others. The courts will assess each claim on its own particular facts and therefore if one claimant recovers more quickly than another, the damages will be reflected accordingly. It is important to note here that \"psychological injuries\" may also follow from an accident which may increase the quantum of damages.\n\nWhen a personal injury claim is settled either in court or out of court, the most common way the compensation payment is made is by a lump sum award in full and final settlement of the claim. Once accepted there can be no further award for compensation at a later time unless the claim is settled by provisional damages often found in industrial injury claims such as asbestos related injuries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Arbitration award]]\n* [[Bad faith]]\n* [[Fine (penalty)]]\n* [[Measure of Damages (under English law)]]\n* [[Non-economic damages caps]]\n* [[Restorative justice]]\n* [[Subrogation]]\n* [[Restitution]]\n*[[Political correctness]]\n*[[Reparations (transitional justice)]]\n*[[Legal remedy]]\n*[[Restitution]]\n*[[Reparation (legal)]]\n*[[Reparations (transitional justice)|Reparations]]\n*[[War reparations]]\n*[[Reparations for slavery]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2011 |month= |title= A Capital Gains Anomaly: Commissioner v.

A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].\n\n===Natural disaster===\n{{Main article| Natural disaster}}\n\nA natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.\n\nVarious phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable land forms, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions which make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable, tardy communication, and poor or no budgetary allocation for disaster prevention, developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.\n[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property.

Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.

He returned to the starting line-up, however, ahead of Albertosi, in Italy's disappointing [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] campaign, during which they would be eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Sandro Pertini Spagna 1982.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Franco Causio]], the Italian president [[Sandro Pertini]], Zoff (lower left) and the coach [[Enzo Bearzot]] on their return from Spain with the 1982 World Cup they just won.]]\n\nFrom 1972 onwards, Zoff became Italy's undisputed number 1, and he participated in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] with Italy, during which he managed a fourth-place finish, keeping 3 clean-sheets. Italy were eliminated in the semi-final, in a 2\u20131 loss to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. After the match, Zoff was criticised for making a fairly uncommon error, as he was beaten by a strike from distance by [[Arie Haan]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Zoff was also Italy's starting goalkeeper once again at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] on home soil, however, helping his side to reach the semi-finals, finishing the tournament in fourth place once again. During the 1980 European Championship, Zoff kept three clean sheets, only conceding one goal in the bronze medal match, which Italy would lose on penalties; Zoff was elected as the goalkeeper of the tournament once again, an honour he had previously managed after winning the tournament in 1968. Throughout these two tournaments, Zoff established a record for most consecutive minutes unbeaten in a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], which was later beaten by [[Iker Casillas]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]. Zoff had also established the record for most minutes unbeaten European Championship qualifying, which was also beaten, by compatriot Buffon in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|2011]]. He still holds the record, however, for most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal at the European Championships including qualifying, having kept eight consecutive cleans heets between 1975 and 1980, while going unbeaten for 784 minutes. Alongside Casillas, Buffon, and [[Thomas Myhre]], he is the goalkeeper with the fewest goals conceded in a single edition of the European Championships, having conceded only one goal in the 1968 European Championships; of these players, only Zoff and Casillas won the title while achieving this feat.\n\nZoff's greatest accomplishment, however, came in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] in Spain, where he captained Italy to victory in the tournament at the age of 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup; throughout the tournament, he kept two clean sheets, and produced a crucial goal-line save in the final minutes of the last second-round group match against favourites Brazil on 5 July, which enabled the Italians to earn a 3\u20132 victory and advance to the semi-finals of the competition.<ref name=\"treccani1\"/><ref name=\"World Cup Hall of Fame\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|title=World Cup Hall of Fame: Dino Zoff|newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912055524/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|archivedate=12 September 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"esclusiva\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/calcio/2013/articoli/1014373/dino-zoff-in-esclusiva-su-premium-calcio-buffon-meglio-di-me-no-sono-piu-bravo-io-.shtml|title=Dino Zoff, in esclusiva su Premium Calcio: \"Buffon meglio di me?

Due to his performances, he was voted as the [[World Cup Golden Glove|Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament]]. Regarding Zoff's importance during Italy's victorious World Cup campaign, his manager [[Enzo Bearzot]] said of him:<ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n{{Quote|\"He was a level-headed goalkeeper, capable of staying calm during the toughest and the most exhilarating moments. He always held back both out of modesty and respect for his opponents. At the end of the Brazil match, he came over to give me a kiss on the cheek, without saying a single word. For me, that fleeting moment was the most intense of the entire World Cup.\"<ref name=\"Dino Zoff: The quiet genius\"/>}}\n\nZoff also holds the record for the longest stretch (1142 minutes) without allowing any goals in international football, set between 1972 and 1974. That clean sheet stretch was ended by Haitian player [[Emmanuel Sanon|Manno Sanon]]'s beautiful goal during the 1974 World Cup. Zoff made his final appearance for Italy on 29 May 1983, in a 2\u20130 away loss to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in an [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|Euro 1984 qualifying match]]. At the time of his retirement, Zoff's 112 caps were the most ever by a member of the Italian national team. He currently sits in sixth place in this category, as well as second among goalkeepers, with Gianluigi Buffon having surpassed the latter record.<ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Style of play==\nZoff was a traditional, effective, and experienced goalkeeper, who usually favoured efficiency and caution over flamboyance when making saves, although he was also capable of producing spectacular dives and decisive saves when necessary due to his strength and athleticism. He was particularly regarded for his outstanding positioning and handling of the ball, in particular when coming out to collect crosses, as well as his concentration, consistency, calm mindset, and composure under pressure; he also possessed good reactions and excellent shot-stopping abilities. Zoff was also noted for his attention to detail during matches, as well as his ability to read the game, anticipate his opponents, communicate with his defenders, and organise his back-line, which also enabled him to start attacking plays quickly from the back after claiming the ball. Despite his serious and reserved character, Zoff also drew praise for his leadership skills, correct behaviour, and competitive spirit, which led him to serve as captain of his national side, and enabled him to inspire a sense of calmness and confidence in his teammates. On occasion, however, Zoff was accused by certain pundits of occasionally struggling when facing long-range shots, and for not always being particularly adept at stopping penalties. Known for his work-rate in training, dedication, and discipline as a footballer, in addition to his goalkeeping skills, Zoff also stood out for his stamina, longevity, and determination, which enabled him to avoid injuries and have an extensive and highly successful career; due to his constant desire to improve himself, he was able to maintain a consistent level of performance throughout his entire career, even with his advancing age towards the end of his career, into his late 30s and early 40s.<ref name=rai/><ref name=figc/><ref name=gazzetta/><ref name=\"Dino Zoff: The quiet genius\"/><ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/><ref name=\"vecchietti\"/><ref name=\"treccani1\"/><ref name=\"Dino Zoff - biografia\"/><ref name=tuttojuve.com/><ref name=\"Zoff, 70 years of quiet success\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2012/m=2/news=zoff-years-quiet-success-1590503.html|title=Zoff, 70 years of quiet success|publisher=FIFA.com|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Neuer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-01-13/ronaldo-pallone-d-oro-ma-io-avrei-premiato-neuer-083419.shtml?refresh_ce=1|title=Ronaldo Pallone d'Oro, ma io avrei premiato Neuer|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore|language=Italian|author1=Mattia Losi|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/calcio_la_nazionale/articoli/77811/zoff-elogio-del-silenzio.shtml|title=Zoff, elogio del silenzio|publisher=Mediaset|language=Italian|author1=Carlo Landoni|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\">{{cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2011/12/italys-best-ever-goalkeeper-dino-zoff-or-gianluigi-buffon/|title=Italy\u2019s Best Ever Goalkeeper: Dino Zoff Or Gianluigi Buffon?|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/news/newsid=949435.html|title=Casillas names his top ten No1s|publisher=UEFA.org|author1=Guillem Balagu\u00e9|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Zoff or Buffon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/node/12901|title=Zoff or Buffon \u2013 who is No 1? \u2013 Football Italia|publisher=Football Italia|author=Giancarlo Rinaldi|date=16 November 2011|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianetagenoa1893.net/la-storia-del-genoa/quella-maledizione-dei-rigori-con-la-juve-tutta-da-sfatare-per-il-genoa/|title=Quella maledizione dei rigori con la Juve, tutta da sfatare per il Genoa|publisher=www.pianetagenoa1893.net|language=Italian|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Uno su tutti\">{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it//2005/settembre/03/Uno_tutti_sw_0_0509031892.shtml |title=Uno su tutti |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |author1=Iacopo Iandiorio |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=30 May 2018 }}</ref> Considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time,<ref name=\"planetworldcup\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/LEGENDS/zoff.html|title=Dino Zoff (Italy)|publisher=Planet World Cup|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11945/9846554/is-bayern-munichs-manuel-neuer-the-best-goalkeeper-ever|title=Is Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer the best goalkeeper ever?|publisher=www.skysports.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> in 1999 he was elected in a poll by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]] as the third best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] of the 20th Century \u2013 after [[Lev Yashin]] (1st) and [[Gordon Banks]] (2nd) \u2013 as well as Italy's best keeper of the century, and the second best European keeper of the century \u2013 behind only Yashin.<ref name=rsssf.com/><ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/>\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, initially as a goalkeeping coach, although this experienced proved to be unsatisfactory for him.<ref name=\"Italy\u2019s towering guardian\"/> He subsequently coached the Italian Olympic side, his first experience as a coach, helping the team to qualify for the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympic Games]] in Seoul, before returning to Juventus in a coaching role; the Italian Olympic side eventually managed a fourth-place finish in the final tournament.

Although Italy were still cautious and organised defensively, Zoff used a more open, fluid, and attacking style of play than that used by his more defensive Italian coaching predecessors [[Cesare Maldini]] and [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. Zoff helped the team to [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|qualify for Euro 2000]], and he introduced several younger players to the team, such as [[Francesco Totti]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Stefano Fiore]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]], [[Christian Abbiati]], [[Marco Delvecchio]], and [[Vincenzo Montella]].<ref name=\"Juventus rallies around stricken legend Dino Zoff\"/> Although Italy were not favourites, he coached a young Italy squad to a second-place finish in [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], suffering a 2\u20131 extra-time defeat at the hands of reigning [[1998 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Champions]] [[France national football team|France]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|final]], due to a golden goal by [[David Trezeguet]]. En route to the final, a ten-man Italy had eliminated co-hosts the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-finals in a penalty shoot-out, after a 0\u20130 draw, following extra-time.

His teams often used a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], who, in addition to his defensive duties and organisational responsibilities, was also required to start plays from the back. He preferred not to base his team's play on set plays and formations, as he believed that cultivating a good relationship with his players and fostering a winning team mentality were the keys to getting the best out of them, and that this would also allow their natural creativity to come through in matches.<ref name=\"libero\">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1990/05/18/subito-libero-da-questa-juve.html|title='SUBITO LIBERO DA QUESTA JUVE'|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=MARCO E.

[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry d\u00e9cembre.jpg|right|thumb|December, from the ''Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry'']]\n\nDecember got its name from the Latin word ''decem'' (meaning [[10 (number)|ten]]) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the [[Roman calendar]], which began in March. The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.<ref name=Macrobius>[[Macrobius]], ''[[Saturnalia]]'', tr. Percival Vaughan Davies (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969), book I, chapters 12\u201313, pp. 89\u201395.</ref> \n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], as one of the four [[Agonalia]], this day in honor of [[Sol Indiges]] was held on December 11, as was [[Septimontium]]. [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|Dies natalis]] (birthday) was held at the temple of [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] on December 13, [[Consualia]] was held on December 15, [[Saturnalia]] was held December 17\u201323, [[Opiconsivia]] was held on December 19, [[Divalia]] was held on December 21, [[Larentalia]] was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of [[Sol Invictus]] was held on December 25. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. \n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] referred to December\u2013January as [[\u0120\u0113olamona\u00fe]] (modern English: \"[[Yule]] month\"). The [[French Republican Calendar]] contained December within the months of [[Frimaire]] and [[Niv\u00f4se]].\n\n==Astronomy==\nDecember contains the [[winter solstice]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the day with the fewest daylight hours, and the [[summer solstice]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the day with the most daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). December in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to [[June]] in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the astronomical [[winter]] is traditionally 21 December or the date of the solstice.\n\nMeteor showers occurring in December are the [[Andromedids]] (September 25 \u2013 December 6, peaking around November 9), the  [[Canis-Minorids]] (December 4 \u2013 December 15, peaking around December 10\u201311), the [[Coma Berenicids]] (December 12 to December 23, peaking around December 16), the [[Delta Cancrids]] (December 14 to February 14, the main shower from January 1 to January 24, peaking on January 17), the [[Geminids]] (December 13\u201314), the [[Monocerotids]] (December 7 to December 20, peaking on December 9. This shower can also start in November), the [[Phoenicids]] (November 29 to December 9, with a peak occurring around 5/6 December), the [[Quadrantids]] (typically a January shower but can also start in December), the [[Sigma Hydrids]] (December 4\u201315), and the [[Ursids]] (December 17-to December 25/26, peaking around December 22).\n\n==Astrology==\n*The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of December are [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (until December 21) and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] (December 22 onwards).<ref>{{cite web|title=Zodiac signs and date ranges used in astrology|url=http://mistupid.com/zodiac/}}</ref>\n\n==December symbols== <!--Check for accuracy-->\n*[[File:Yellow Narcissus.JPG|alt=Yellow narcissus flower|thumb|Yellow [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]] flower]]December's birth flower is the [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].\n*[[File:Turquoise polie 1 (USA).jpg|alt=A slab of turquoise|thumb|A slab of [[turquoise]]]]December's birthstones are the [[turquoise]], [[zircon]], and [[tanzanite]].\n\n==Observances==\n''This list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.''\n===Non-Gregorian observances: 2018 dates===\n(Please note that all Baha'i, Islamic, and Jewish observances begin at sundown prior to the date listed, and end at sundown of the date in question unless otherwise noted.)\n*December 22: [[Poya]] ([[Buddhism]], public holiday in [[Sri Lanka]])\n\n===Month-long observances===\n*In Catholic tradition, December is the Month of the Advent of Christ.\n*[[List of food months#December|National Egg Nog Month]] (United States)\n*[[List of observances in the United States by presidential proclamation#Annual special months recognized by presidential proclamation|National Impaired Driving Prevention Month]] (United States)\n*[[List of food months#December|National Fruit Cake Month]] (United States)\n*[[List of food months#December|National Pear Month]] (United States)\n*[[Gender neutrality#Campaigns|No Gender December]] ([[International observance|International]])\n\n===Movable observances: 2017 dates===\n*[[Small Business Saturday UK]]: December 2\n*[[Chalica]] ([[Unitarian Universalism]]): December 4\u201311\n*[[Public holidays in Kiribati|Human Rights and Peace Day (Kiribati)]]: December 9\n'''Last Week of November: November 26 \u2013 December 3'''\n*[[AIDS Awareness Week]] ([[Canada]]) \n'''First Friday: December 1'''\n*[[Public holidays in Ghana|Farmer's Day]] ([[Ghana]])\n*[[Public holidays in the Marshall Islands|Gospel Day]] ([[Marshall Islands]]) \n'''First Sunday: December 3'''\n*[[First Presidency's Christmas Devotional]] ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]])\n*[[Public holidays in Turkmenistan|Good Neighborliness Day]] ([[Turkmenistan]])\n*[[Sindhi Cultural Day]] ([[Sindhi diaspora]])\n'''Fourth Sunday before Christmas Day: December 3'''\n*[[Advent Sunday]] (start of [[Advent]], [[Western Christianity]])\n'''Second Monday: December 11'''\n*[[Green Monday]]\n*[[National Tree Planting Day (Malawi)]]\n'''Sunday two weeks before Christmas: December 12'''\n*[[Serbian Christmas tradition|Detinjci]] ([[Serbia]])\n'''December 15, unless the date falls on a Sunday, then December 16: December 15'''\n*[[Koninkrijksdag]] ([[Kingdom of the Netherlands]])\n'''Second-final Sunday before Christmas Day: December 17'''\n*[[Gaudete Sunday]] ([[Western Christianity]])\n'''Thursday before Christmas: December 21'''\n*[[Chewidden Thursday]] ([[Cornwall]]) (Thursday of the last full week before Christmas)\n*[[National Regifting Day]] ([[United States]]) \n'''[[Winter Solstice]]: December 21'''\n*[[Blue Christmas (holiday)]]\n*[[Brumalia]] ([[Ancient Rome]])\n*[[Dongzhi Festival]] ([[Asia]])\n*[[Global Orgasm]]\n*[[Korochun]] ([[Slavic people|Slavic]])\n*[[Midsummer]] in the Southern Hemisphere.

He made two voyages sailing along the west coast of [[Africa]] in the 1480s, exploring the [[Congo River]] and the coasts of the present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911}}\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Armas Diogo C\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Diogo C\u00e3o's Coat of Arms]]\nC\u00e3o was born in [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]] (some say in [[\u00c9vora]]), in the middle of the 15th century, the illegitimate son of \u00c1lvaro Fernandes or Gon\u00e7alves C\u00e3o, [[fidalgo]] of the [[Royal Household]], himself the illegitimate son of Gon\u00e7alo C\u00e3o. He married and had four children: Pedro C\u00e3o, Manuel C\u00e3o, Andr\u00e9 Afonso C\u00e3o, and Isabel C\u00e3o.\n\n==Explorer==\n[[Image:Caopillar.JPG|thumb|130px|left|The [[padr\u00e3o]] bearing the arms of Portugal erected by C\u00e3o at Cape St. Mary]]\n[[Image:Matadi, Congo, pedra de Ielala, Diogo C\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|300px|Stone of Ielala, with the inscriptions of Diogo C\u00e3o]]\nHe was the first European known to sight and enter the [[Congo River]] and to explore the West African coast between Cape St. Catherine in [[Gabon]] and [[Cape Cross]], almost from the [[equator]] to [[Walvis Bay]] in Namibia.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Cam (C\u00e3o), Diogo|last=Beazley |first=Charles Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Beazley| volume=5 |page=79}}</ref>\n\n===First voyage===\nWhen King [[John II of Portugal]] restarted the work of [[Henry the Navigator]], he sent out C\u00e3o (probably around midsummer 1482) to explore the African coast south of the [[equator]]. He discovered the mouth and [[estuary]] of the Congo, probably in August 1482 and marked it with a [[padr\u00e3o]], or stone pillar erected on Shark Point, attesting to the sovereignty of [[Portugal]]. This padr\u00e3o still stands to this day, albeit in ruins. He also ascended the great river for a short distance, and commenced modest commerce with the natives of the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Bakongo]] kingdom. C\u00e3o then coasted down along the present [[Angola]] (Portuguese West Africa), and erected a second padr\u00e3o, probably marking the termination of this voyage, at Cape Saint Mary (the Monte Negro of these first visitors). He returned to Lisbon by 8 April 1484, where John II ennobled him, promoting him from esquire to a [[knight]] of his [[Court (royal) | household]], and granted him an annuity and a coat of arms.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On his return he discovered the Island of [[Annob\u00f3n]].\n\n===Second voyage===\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries diogo cao.jpg|thumb|190px|Diogo C\u00e3o]]\nThat C\u00e3o, on his second voyage of 1484\u20131486, was accompanied by [[Martin Behaim]] (as alleged on the latter's Nuremberg globe of 1492) is very doubtful. But it is known that the explorer revisited the Congo and erected two more padr\u00e3o on land beyond his previous voyage. The first was at Cabo Negro, Angola, the second at [[Cape Cross]]. The Cape Cross pillar probably marked the end of his progress southward, some 1,400 kilometers.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> C\u00e3o ascended the [[Congo River|Kongo River]] (which he thought led towards the realm of [[Prester John]]), up to the neighborhood of the site of [[Matadi]]. There, in October or November 1485, near the falls of [[Yellala Falls|Ielala]], he left an inscription engraved on the stone which testifies of its passage and that of his men: ''Aqui chegaram os navios do esclarecido rei D.Jo\u00e3o II de Portugal - Diogo C\u00e3o, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa.'' (\"Here reached the ships of the enlightned king [[John II of Portugal]] \u2013 Diogo C\u00e3o, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa\").\n\nAccording to one authority (a legend on the 1489 map of [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]]), C\u00e3o died off [[Cape Cross]]; but [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] and others wrote of his return to the Kongo, and subsequent taking of a native envoy to Portugal. The four pillars set up by C\u00e3o on his two voyages have all been discovered still on their original site, and the inscriptions on two of them from Cape Santa Maria and Cape Cross, dated 1482 and 1485 respectively, are still to be read and have been printed. The Cape Cross padr\u00e3o is now at [[Berlin]] (replaced on the spot by a granite facsimile); those from the Kongo estuary and the more southerly Cape Santa Maria and Cabo Negro are in the Museum of the Lisbon Geographical Society.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==In literature==\n\nDiogo C\u00e3o is the subject of ''Padr\u00e3o'', one of the best-known poems in [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s book ''Mensagem'', the only one published during the author's lifetime. He also figures strongly in the 1996 novel ''Lord of the Kongo'' by Peter Forbath.\n\n==Sources==\n* Barros, Jo\u00e3o de. ''D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia'', D\u00e9cada I. bk.

Often, there were special prizes and penalties for one's performance in the game.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120630214945/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/hetairai/kottabos.html Kottabos]</ref>\n\n===Ancient China===\nDrinking games were enjoyed in ancient [[China]], usually incorporating the use of [[dice]] or verbal exchange of [[riddle]]s.<ref name=\"benn\">{{cite book | author = Benn, Charles | date = 2002 | title =China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty | location = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-517665-0 }}</ref>{{rp|145}} During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), the Chinese used a [[silver]] canister where written lots could be drawn that designated which player had to drink and specifically how much; for example, from 1, 5, 7, or 10 measures of drink that the youngest player, or the last player to join the game, or the most talkative player, or the host, or the player with the greatest [[ethanol|alcohol]] tolerance, etc. had to drink.<ref name=\"benn\"/>{{rp|145\u2013146}} There were even drinking game [[referee]] officials, including a 'registrar of the rules' who knew all the rules to the game, a 'registrar of the horn' who tossed a silver flag down on calling out second offenses, and a 'governor' who decided one's third call of offense.<ref name=\"benn\"/>{{rp|146}} These referees were used mainly for maintaining order (as drinking games often became rowdy) and for reviewing faults that could be punished with a player drinking a penalty cup.<ref name=\"benn\"/>{{rp|146}} If a guest was considered a 'coward' for dropping out of the game, he could be branded as a 'deserter' and not invited back to further drinking bouts.<ref name=\"benn\"/>{{rp|146}} There was another game where little puppets and dolls dressed as western foreigners with blue eyes ([[Iranian peoples]]) were set up and when one fell over, the person it pointed to had to empty his cup of wine.<ref name=\"schafer 23\">{{cite book | author = Schafer, Edward H | title = The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A study of T\u2019ang Exotics | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles | edition = 1st paperback | date = 1985 | isbn = 0-520-05462-8}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Beer bong 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bonging is popular among college students]]\n\n===Endurance===\nThe simplest drinking games are endurance games in which players compete to out-drink one another. Players take turns taking shots, and the last person standing is the winner. Some games have rules involving the \"cascade\", \"fountain\" or \"waterfall\", which encourages each player to drink constantly from their cup so long as the player before him does not stop drinking. Such games can also favor speed over quantity, in which players race to drink a case of beer the fastest. Often drinking large amounts will be combined with a stylistic element or an abnormal method of drinking, as with the [[boot of beer]], [[yard of ale]] or a [[keg stand]].\n\nTolerance games are simply about seeing which player can last the longest. It can be as simple as two people matching each other drink for drink until one of the participants \"passes out\". [[Power hour]] and its variant, [[centurion (game)|centurion]], fall under this category.\n\n===Speed===\nMany pub or bar games involve competitive drinking for speed. Examples of such drinking games are [[Edward Fortyhands]], [[Boat race (game)|boat races]], [[beer bong]]ing, [[shotgunning]], [[flippy cup]] (a team-based speed game), and [[Yard glass|yard]]. Some say that the most important skill to improving speed is to relax and take fewer but larger gulps. There are a variety of individual tactics to accomplishing this, such as bending the knees in anticipation, or when drinking from a plastic cup, squeezing the sides of the cup to form a more perfect funnel.\n\nAthletic races involving alcohol including the [[beer mile]], which consists of a mile run with a can of beer consumed before each of the four laps. A variant is known in German speaking countries as ''[[kastenlauf|Bierkastenlauf]]'' (beer crate running) where a team of two carries a crate of beer along a route of several kilometers and must consume all of the bottles prior to crossing the finish line.\n\n===Skill===\nSome party and pub games focus on the performance of a particular act of skill, rather than on either the amount a participant drinks or the speed with which they do so. Examples include [[beer pong]], [[Quarters (drinking game)|quarters]], chandeliers (also known as gaucho ball, rage cage, stack cup), [[caps (drinking game)|caps]], [[polish horseshoes]], [[Beer pong (paddles)|pong]], and [[beerdarts|beer darts]].\n\n[[Pub Golf]] involves [[orienteering]] and [[pub crawl]]ing together.\n\n===Thinking===\nThinking games rely on the players' powers of observation, recollection, logic and articulation.\n\nNumerous types of thinking games exist, including Think or Drink, [[21 (drinking game)|21]], [[beer checkers]], [[bizz buzz]], [[buffalo (drinking game)|buffalo]], saved by the bell, [[cheat (game)|bullshit]], tourettes, [[matchbox (drinking game)|matchboxes]], [[never have I ever]], [[roman numerals (game)|roman numerals]], [[Fuzzy Duck (drinking game)|fuzzy duck]], [[pennying]], wine games, and [[Zoom Schwartz Profigliano]]. [[Trivia]] games, such as [[Trivial Pursuit]], are sometimes played as drinking games.\n\n===Card and dice===\n[[File:Kings Cup.png|thumb|Kings is played with cards.]]\nDrinking games involving [[card game|cards]] are [[president (card game)|president]], [[horserace (drinking game)|horserace]], [[kings (drinking game)|Kings]], [[liar's poker]], [[pyramid (drinking game)|pyramid]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VximCb9MQeA |title=Video: how to play pyramid |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121093202/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VximCb9MQeA |archivedate=2015-11-21 |df= }}</ref> [[Ring of Fire (game)|Ring of Fire]], [[Toepen]], [[ride the bus]] and [[Black or Red]].\n\nDice games include [[beer die]], [[dudo]], [[kinito]], [[liar's dice]], [[mexico (game)|Mexico]], [[mia (game)|mia]], 15, [[pounce!]], [[ship, captain, and crew]], and [[three man]].\n\n===Arts===\nMovie drinking games are played while watching a [[movie]] (sometimes a TV show or a sporting event) and have a set of rules for who drinks when and how much based on on-screen events and dialogue. The rules may be the same for all players, or alternatively players may each be assigned rules related to particular characters. The rules are designed so that rarer events require larger drinks. Rule sets for such games are usually arbitrary and local, although they are sometimes published by fan clubs.\n\nIn reference to film, a popular game among young adults consists of printing out a mustache and taping it on the television screen. Every time the mustache fits appropriately to a person on the screen, one must drink the designated amount. This game allows people to do nothing but watch television and drink with purpose.\n\nLive drinking games such as Los Angeles-based \"A Drinking Game\"<ref name=\"LA Weekly\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/2011/11/a_drinking_game_at_molly_malones_natalie_lynch.php|title=A Drinking Game at Molly Malone's: Actors Perform Live Readings of Classic Movies.

Chaos Ensues.|publisher=laweekly.com|accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> involve recreating films of the 80s in a \"Rocky Horror\" fashion, with gift bags, drinking cues, and costumed actors. A suggestion to \"do six shots for [[SEAL Team 6]]\" following every mention of [[Osama bin Laden]] at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] necessitated a prominent disclaimer on the satire site that posted it, as the quantity of alcohol ingested would probably have been lethal.<ref name=\"ddgtidubo20120906\">{{Citation\n| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/dnc-drinking-game_n_1855488.html\n| title = DNC Drinking Game: Tune In, Drink Up, Black Out\n| author = Huffington Post\n| accessdate = 2012-09-06\n| date=2012-09-04\n}}</ref>\n\n\"Datsyuk Game\" involves a [[Pavel Datsyuk|Datsyuk]] highlight reel being played and contestants drink every time the word ''Datsyuk'' is mentioned. The ceremonial playing of the Russian national anthem before the game is another tradition.\n\nMusic can also be used as a basis for drinking games. The song \"Thunderstruck\" by [[AC/DC]] is used in which a player begins drinking when the word thunder is sung and switches to the next player the next time it is sung.\n\nSport related drinking games involve the participants each selecting a scenario of the game resulting in their drink being downed. Examples of this include participants each picking a footballer in a game while other versions require multiple players to be selected. Should a player score or be sent off, a drink must be taken. Another version requires a drink for every touch a player takes of the ball.\n\n===Hybrid games===\nSome drinking games can fall into multiple categories such as a [[Power hour]] which is a primarily an endurance-based game, but can also incorporate the arts if players are prompted to drink by a playlist that changes songs every 60 seconds. Similarly, [[Flip cup]] combines the skill of flipping cups with the speed of drinking quickly prior to flipping.\n\n=== Mobile app games ===\nMany drinking game apps have been launched on mobile devices, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Drink|Games}}\n* [[Binge drinking]]\n* [[Pregaming]]\n* [[List of drinking games]]\n* [[List of public house topics]]\n* ''[[Beerfest]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Drinking games}}\n* {{dmoz|Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games/|Drinking Games}}\n\n{{Drinking games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drinking Game}}\n[[Category:Drinking games| ]]", "sha1": "dz37b6g797ti47e1whrhwbtq0drd005"}}, {"title": "Devon", "ns": "0", "id": "8166", "revision": {"id": "864951012", "parentid": "864950954", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T17:43:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Oshwah", "id": "3174456"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/158.222.147.55|158.222.147.55]] ([[User talk:158.222.147.55|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{redirect|Devonshire}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{infobox English county\n| official_name           = Devon\n| flag_image              = [[File:Flag of Devon.svg|150px|St Petroc's flag of Devon]]\n| flag_link               = Flag of Devon\n| motto                   = \"Auxilio Divino\" <br />(\"With God's help\")\n| locator_map             = [[File:Devon UK locator map 2010.svg|200px|Devon within England]]\n| coordinates             = {{Coord|50.7|N|3.8|W|region:GB|display=title, inline}}\n| region                  = [[South West England|South West]]\n| established_date        = [[Historic counties of England|Ancient]]\n| lord_lieutenant_office  = Lord Lieutenant of Devon\n| lord_lieutenant_name    = David Fursdon<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lord-lieutenant-for-devon-david-fursdon |title=Lord-Lieutenant for Devon: David Fursdon - Press releases |website=GOV.UK |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>\n| high_sheriff_office     = High Sheriff of Devon\n| high_sheriff_name       = Mrs Grania Phillips (2018/19) <ref>{{London Gazette|issue=62229 |pages=4814\u20134814|date=15 March 2018 |nolink=y}}</ref>\n| area_total_km2          = 6707\n| area_total_rank         = 4th\n| ethnicity               = 94.5% White British (2011) {{refn|group=note|Data is collected by local authority areas (Devon, Plymouth, Torbay respectively).

It is part of [[South West England]], bounded by [[Cornwall]] to the west, [[Somerset]] to the north east, and [[Dorset]] to the east. The city of [[Exeter]] is the [[county town]]. The county includes the districts of [[East Devon]], [[Mid Devon]], [[North Devon]], [[South Hams]], [[Teignbridge]], [[Torridge]], and [[West Devon]].

During the [[British Iron Age]], [[Roman Britain]], and the [[Sub-Roman Britain|early Middle Ages]], this was the homeland of the [[Dumnonii]] [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celts. (The shift from \"M\" to \"V\" is a typical Celtic [[lenition|consonant shift]].) The [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] during the eighth and ninth centuries. The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the [[River Tamar]] by [[\u00c6thelstan|King \u00c6thelstan]] in 936. Devon was later constituted as a [[shire]] of the [[Kingdom of England]].\n\nThe north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's [[bay]]s contain [[seaside resort]]s, fishing towns, and ports. The inland terrain is rural and generally hilly, and has a lower population density than many other parts of England. [[Dartmoor]] is the largest open space in southern England, at {{convert|954|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/dartmoor.aspx |title=Welcome to the Dartmoor National Park Authority |website=Naturalengland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref> its [[moorland]] extends across a large expanse of [[granite]] bedrock. To the north of Dartmoor are the [[Culm Measures]] and [[Exmoor]]. In the valleys and lowlands of south and east Devon the soil is more fertile, drained by rivers including the [[River Exe|Exe]], the [[River Culm|Culm]], the [[River Teign|Teign]], the [[River Dart|Dart]], and the [[River Otter, Devon|Otter]].\n\nAs well as agriculture, much of the [[economy of Devon]] is based on [[tourism]]. The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape make Devon a destination for [[tourism in England|recreation and leisure in England]], with visitors particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the [[English Riviera]]; the [[Jurassic Coast]], and [[North Devon's Biosphere Reserve|North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]; and the countryside including the [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Devon}}\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe name ''Devon'' derives from the name of the [[Britons]] who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] known as the [[Dumnonii]], thought to mean \"deep valley dwellers\" from [[Proto-Celtic language|proto Celtic]] ''*dubnos'' 'deep'. In the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], Devon is known as {{lang-cy|Dyfnaint}}, {{lang-br|Devnent}} and {{lang-kw|Dewnens}}, each meaning \"deep valleys.\" (For an account of Celtic ''[[Dumnonia]]'', see the separate article.) Among the most common Devon placenames is ''-combe'' which derives from Brittonic ''cwm'' meaning 'valley' usually prefixed by the name of the possessor.\n\n[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', described Devon as being one part of an older, wider country that once included Cornwall:\n{{quote|THAT region which, according to the Geographers, is the first of all Britaine, and, growing straiter still and narrower, shooteth out farthest into the West, [...] was in antient time inhabited by those Britans whom Solinus called Dumnonii, Ptolomee Damnonii [...] For their habitation all over this Countrey is somewhat low and in valleys, which manner of dwelling is called in the British tongue Dan-munith, in which sense also the Province next adjoyning in like respect is at this day named by the Britans Duffneit, that is to say, Low valleys. [...] But the Country of this nation is at this day divided into two parts, knowen by later names of Cornwall and Denshire, [...]|William Camden, ''Britannia''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/cornwalleng.html\n|title=William Camden, Britannia (1607) with an English translation by Philemon Holland \u2013 Danmonii\n|publisher=The University of Birmingham\n|accessdate=30 June 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nThe term \"Devon\" is normally used for everyday purposes e.g. \"Devon County Council\" but \"Devonshire\" continues to be used in the names of the \"[[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]]\" (until 2007) and \"[[The Devonshire Association]]\". One erroneous theory is that the \"shire\" suffix is due to a mistake in the making of the original letters patent for the [[Duke of Devonshire#Earls of Devon|Duke of Devonshire]], resident in [[Derbyshire]]. However, there are references to \"Defenascire\" in [[Anglo-Saxon]] texts from before 1000 AD (this would mean \"Shire of the Devonians\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html|title=Manuscript A: The Parker Chronicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref> which translates to modern English as \"Devonshire\". The term Devonshire may have originated around the 8th century, when it changed from ''Dumnonia'' ([[Latin]]) to ''Defenascir''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=The Isles: A History|page=207|year=2000|isbn=0-333-69283-7}}</ref>\n\n===Human occupation===\n[[File:Drizzlecombe stones 6.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Menhir]] at [[Drizzlecombe]]]]\n[[Kents Cavern]] in Torquay had produced human remains from 30\u201340,000 years ago. [[Dartmoor]] is thought to have been occupied by [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples from about 6000 BC. The Romans held the area under military occupation for around 350 years. Later, the area began to experience Saxon incursions from the east around 600 AD, firstly as small bands of settlers along the coasts of [[Lyme Bay]] and southern estuaries and later as more organised bands pushing in from the east. Devon became a frontier between [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]]  and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Wessex]], and it was largely absorbed into Wessex by the mid 9th century. A genetic study carried out by the [[University of Oxford]] & [[University College London]] discovered separate genetic groups in Cornwall and Devon, not only were there differences on either side of the Tamar, with a division almost exactly along the modern county boundary dating back to the 6th Century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-03-19-who-do-you-think-you-really-are-genetic-map-british-isles|title=Who do you think you really are?

Danish raids also occurred sporadically along many coastal parts of Devon between around 800AD and just before the time of the Norman conquest, including the silver mint at ''Hlidaforda'' [[Lydford]] in 997 and Taintona (a settlement on the [[River Teign|Teign]] estuary) in 1001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lydford.co.uk/stockholm-museum.htm |title=Lydford Silver Pennies In The Stockholm Coin Museum |website=Lydford.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305063037/http://www.lydford.co.uk/stockholm-museum.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDevon has also featured in most of the civil conflicts in England since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], including the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Perkin Warbeck]]'s rising in 1497, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549, and the [[English Civil War]]. The arrival of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] to launch the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 took place at [[Brixham]].\n\nDevon has produced [[tin]], copper and other metals from ancient times.

Agriculture has been an important industry in Devon since the 19th century. The [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] harmed the farming community severely.<ref>''In Devon, the county council estimated that 1,200 jobs would be lost in agriculture and ancillary rural industries'' \u2013 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 ''Hansard'', 25 April 2001]</ref> Since then some parts of the agricultural industry have begun to diversify and recover, with a strong local food sector and many artisan producers.

The [[Met Office]], the UK's national and international weather service, moved to Exeter in 2003. Plymouth hosts the head office and first ever store of [[The Range (retailer)|The Range]], the only major national retail chain headquartered in Devon.\n\nSince the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism. The county's economy followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid-20th century, but with some recent revival and regeneration of its resorts, particularly focused around camping; sports such as surfing, cycling, sailing and heritage. This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the Dartmoor and [[Exmoor]] national parks, and the [[Jurassic Coast]] and [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]] World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion.<!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy \u2013 the GVA is around 9&nbsp;billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326065518/http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> More successful visitor attractions are particularly concentrated on food and drink, the South West Coast Path and watersports, including sea-view restaurants in North-West Devon (such as one example belonging to [[Damien Hurst]]); surfing there, indoor and outdoor folk music festivals across the county and sailing in the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} hill-surrounded inlet ([[ria]]) at Salcombe.\n\nIncomes vary significantly and the average is bolstered by a high proportion of affluent retired people from across Europe's major cities, particularly from the rest of England. Incomes in much of the South Hams and in villages surrounding Exeter and Plymouth are above the national average.  The claimant count of the unemployed and people receiving very low incomes is close to the national average of 4.5% in Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter. Their exurbs and rural villages contribute to low unemployment in the administrative county as shown below.\n\nThe table also shows the population change in the ten years to the 2011 census by subdivision.  It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Devon is [[East Devon]] but only if excluding [[Torbay]] which has marginally more residents and [[Plymouth]] which has approximately double the number of residents of either of these.  [[West Devon]] has the fewest residents, having 63,839 at the time of the census.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Population from census to census.

London: H.M.S.O.</ref> The [[South West Coast Path]] runs along the entire length of both, around 65% of which is named as [[Heritage Coast]]. Before the changes to English counties in 1974, Devon was the [[Historic counties of England#List of counties|third largest county]] by area and the largest of the counties not divided into county-like divisions (only Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were larger and both were sub-divided into ridings or parts, respectively).<ref>''Whitaker's Almanack'', 1972; p. 631</ref> Since 1974 the county is ranked fourth by area (due to the creation of Cumbria) [[List of ceremonial counties of England|amongst ceremonial counties]] and is the [[List of two-tier counties of England|third largest non-metropolitan county]]. The island of [[Lundy]] and the reef of [[Eddystone Rocks|Eddystone]] are also in Devon. The county has more mileage of road than any other county in England.\n\nInland, the [[Dartmoor]] [[National park|National Park]] lies wholly in Devon, and the [[Exmoor]] National Park lies in both Devon and [[Somerset]]. Apart from these areas of high moorland the county has attractive rolling rural scenery and villages with [[thatch]]ed [[Cob (building)|cob]] cottages. All these features make Devon a popular [[tourism|holiday]] destination.\n\nIn [[South Devon]] the landscape consists of rolling hills dotted with small towns, such as [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]], [[Ivybridge]], [[Kingsbridge]], [[Salcombe]], and [[Totnes]]. The towns of [[Torquay]] and [[Paignton]] are the principal [[seaside resort]]s on the south coast. East Devon has the first seaside resort to be developed in the county, [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and the more upmarket Georgian town of [[Sidmouth]], headquarters of the East Devon District Council. Exmouth marks the western end of the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Another notable feature is the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line|coastal railway line]] between Newton Abbot and the Exe Estuary: the red sandstone cliffs and sea views are very dramatic and in the resorts railway line and beaches are very near.\n[[File:Torquay Palm Trees.jpg|thumb|Torquay sea front during Storm Emma - March 2018]]\n[[North Devon]] is very rural with few major towns except [[Barnstaple]], [[Great Torrington]], [[Bideford]] and [[Ilfracombe]].

One of the features of the North Devon coast is that [[Bideford Bay]] and the [[Hartland Point]] peninsula are both west-facing, Atlantic facing coastlines; so that a combination of an off-shore (east) wind and an Atlantic swell produce excellent surfing conditions. The beaches of Bideford Bay ([[Woolacombe]], [[Saunton]], [[Westward Ho!]] and [[Croyde]]), along with parts of North Cornwall and South Wales, are the main centres of surfing in Britain.\n\n{{See also|List of mountains and hills of Devon}}\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Geologic map Wales & SW England EN.svg|thumb|Geological map of Wales & Southwest England.]]\nA geological dividing line cuts across Devon roughly along the line of the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] and the M5 motorway east of Tiverton and Exeter. It is a part of the [[Tees-Exe line]] broadly dividing Britain into a southeastern lowland zone typified by gently dipping [[sedimentary rock]]s and a northwestern upland zone typified by [[igneous rock]]s and folded sedimentary and [[metamorphic rock]]s.\n\nThe principal geological components of Devon are the [[Devonian]] (in north Devon, south west Devon and extending into Cornwall); the [[Culm Measures]] (north western Devon also extending into north Cornwall); and the [[granite]] [[intrusion]] of [[Dartmoor]] in central Devon, part of the [[Cornubian batholith]] forming the 'spine' of the southwestern peninsula.

It is also found on the western, north and eastern borders of Dartmoor.\n\nThe sedimentary rocks in more eastern parts of the county include [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones (giving rise to east Devon's well known fertile red soils); Bunter [[pebble beds]] around Budleigh Salterton and Woodbury Common and [[Jurassic]] rocks in the easternmost parts of Devon. Smaller outcrops of younger rocks also exist, such as Cretaceous [[chalk]] cliffs at Beer Head and gravels on Haldon, plus [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[ball clay]] and [[lignite]] deposits in the Bovey Basin, formed around 50 million years ago under tropical forest conditions.\n\n===Climate===\n{{See also|Dartmoor#Climate|climate of south-west England}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nDevon generally has a mild climate, heavily influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]]. In winter snow is relatively uncommon away from high land, although there are exceptions, such as the snowfalls of [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|February 2009]], [[Winter of 2010-2011 in Great Britain and Ireland|December 2010]], and March 2018. The county has warm summers with occasional hot spells and cool rainy periods.

Rainfall varies significantly across the county, ranging from over {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}} on parts of Dartmoor, to around {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the [[rain shadow]] along the coast in southeastern Devon and around Exeter. Sunshine amounts also vary widely: the moors are generally cloudy, but the SE coast from Salcombe to Exmouth is one of the sunniest parts of the UK. With westerly or southwesterly winds and high pressure the area around Torbay and Teignmouth will often be very warm, with long sunny spells due to shelter by high ground ([[Foehn wind]]).\n{{Weather box\n|location = Devon\n|metric first=Yes\n|single line=Yes\n|Jan high C = 8\n|Feb high C = 8\n|Mar high C = 10\n|Apr high C = 12\n|May high C = 15\n|Jun high C = 18\n|Jul high C = 19\n|Aug high C = 19\n|Sep high C = 18\n|Oct high C = 15\n|Nov high C = 11\n|Dec high C = 9\n|year high C = 13.5\n|Jan low C = 4\n|Feb low C = 4\n|Mar low C = 5\n|Apr low C = 6\n|May low C = 8\n|Jun low C = 11\n|Jul low C = 13\n|Aug low C = 13\n|Sep low C = 12\n|Oct low C = 9\n|Nov low C = 7\n|Dec low C = 5\n|year low C = 8\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n{{wide image|Devon fields stitch.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Fields in south Devon after a snowfall.}}\n\n===Ecology===\n[[File:Pnies5.jpg|thumb|Ponies grazing on Exmoor near [[Brendon]], [[North Devon]].]]\nThe variety of habitats means that there is a wide range of wildlife (see [[Dartmoor wildlife]], for example).

(However, for ecclesiastical purposes these were nevertheless in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] and in 1876 became part of the [[Diocese of Truro]].)\n\n==Religion==\n\n===Ancient and medieval history===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nThe region of Devon was the dominion of the Dumnonii [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]] they were also called \"Deep Valley Dwellers\". The region was less Romanised than the rest of [[Roman Britain]] since it was considered a remote province. The Romans left the region around AD 410, this is when one of the leading Dumnonii families attempted to create a dynasty and rules over Devon as the Kings of Dumnonii.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/devon/devon.html|title=Britannia History: Overview of Devon|website=www.britannia.com|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Celtic polytheism|Celtic paganism]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman practice]]s were the first known religions in Devon, although in the mid-fourth century AD, Christianity was introduced to Devon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/fs28_-_anglo_saxon_devon.pdf|title=Devon Libraries: Sources for Anglo-Saxon Devon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman period]] the church in the British Isles was characterised by some differences in practice from the Latin Christianity of the continent of Europe and is known as [[Celtic Christianity]];<ref>Bowen, E.

Many [[list of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]] are commemorated also in Devon in legends, churches and placenames. [[Western Christianity]] came to Devon when it was over a long period incorporated into the kingdom of Wessex and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Wessex. [[Saint Petroc]] is said to have passed through Devon, where ancient dedications to him are even more numerous than in Cornwall: a probable seventeen (plus [[Timberscombe]] just over the border in Somerset), compared to Cornwall's five. The position of churches bearing his name, including one within the old Roman walls of [[Exeter]], are nearly always near the coast, reminding us that in those days travelling was done mainly by sea. The Devonian villages of [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]] are also named after Saint Petroc and the [[flag of Devon]] is dedicated to him.\n\nThe history of Christianity in the South West of England remains to some degree obscure. Parts of the historic county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex, while nothing is known of the church organisation of the Celtic areas. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate diocese of Sherborne and in 900 this was again divided into two, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [[Bishop's Tawton]]) and from 912 at [[Crediton]], birthplace of St Boniface. [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]] became [[Bishop of Crediton]] in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [[Bishop of Cornwall]].\n\nThe two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [[Edward the Confessor]] by [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]]'s successor [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Bishop Leofric]], hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under [[Edward the Confessor]], which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first, the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1549, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. During the [[English Reformation]], churches in Devon officially became affiliated with the [[Church of England]]. From the late sixteenth century onwards, zealous Protestantism \u2013 or 'puritanism' \u2013 became increasingly well-entrenched in some parts of Devon, while other districts of the county remained much more conservative. These divisions would become starkly apparent during the English Civil War of 1642\u201346, when the county split apart along religious and cultural lines.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoyle|first1=Mark|title=Loyalty and Locality: Popular Allegiance in Devon during the English Civil War|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85989-428-2|page=passim.}}</ref> The [[Methodism]] of [[John Wesley]] proved to be very popular with the working classes in Devon in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working class Devonians. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Devon today, although the county has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling.\n\nThe [[Diocese of Exeter]] remains the Anglican diocese including the whole of Devon. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth]] was established in the mid 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/ |title=Home |website=Plymouth-diocese.org.uk |date=15 February 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\nDespite its small Jewish population, Devon is also noted for containing two of Britain's oldest synagogues, located in [[Plymouth Synagogue|Plymouth]] and [[Exeter Synagogue|Exeter]], built in 1762 and 1763 respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Devon arms.png|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] of Devon County Council.]]\nThere was no established [[coat of arms]] for the county until 1926: the arms of the City of [[Exeter]] were often used to represent Devon, for instance in the badge of the [[Devonshire Regiment]]. During the forming of a county council by the [[Local Government Act 1888]] adoption of a common seal was required. The seal contained three shields depicting the arms of Exeter along with those of the first chairman and vice-chairman of the council ([[Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 20th Baron Clinton|Lord Clinton]] and the [[Earl of Morley]]).<ref>Fox-Davies, A. C. (1915) ''The Book of Public Arms'', 2nd edition, London</ref>\n\nOn 11 October 1926, the county council received a grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]]. The main part of the shield displays a red crowned lion on a silver field, the arms of [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall]]. The ''chief'' or upper portion of the shield depicts an ancient ship on wavers, for Devon's seafaring traditions. The [[Latin]] motto adopted was ''Auxilio Divino'' (by Divine aid), that of Sir [[Francis Drake]]. The 1926 grant was of arms alone. On 6 March 1962 a further grant of crest and supporters was obtained. The crest is the head of a [[Dartmoor Pony]] rising from a \"Naval Crown\". This distinctive form of crown is formed from the sails and sterns of ships, and is associated with the [[Royal Navy]]. The supporters are a [[North Devon cattle|Devon bull]] and a sea lion.<ref>W.

There are 37 state and 23 independent secondary schools. There are three tertiary ([[Further education|FE]]) colleges and an [[agricultural college]] ([[Bicton College]], near [[Budleigh Salterton]]). Torbay has 8 state (with 3 [[grammar school]]s) and 3 independent secondary schools, and Plymouth has 17 state (with 3 grammar schools \u2013 two female and one male) and one independent school, [[Plymouth College]]. East Devon and Teignbridge have the largest school populations, with West Devon the smallest (with only two schools). Only one school in Exeter, Mid Devon, Torridge and North Devon have a [[sixth form]] \u2013 the schools in other districts mostly have sixth forms, with all schools in West Devon and East Devon having a sixth form.\n\nTwo universities are located in Devon, the [[University of Exeter]] (split between the [[Streatham Campus]] and [[St Luke's Campus]], both in Exeter, and a campus in [[Cornwall]]); in Plymouth the [[University of Plymouth]] in Britain is present, along with the [[University of St Mark & St John]] to the city's north. The universities of Exeter and Plymouth have together formed the [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] which has bases in Exeter and Plymouth. There is also [[Schumacher College]].\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Cuisine of Devon}}\nThe county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire [[cream tea]], involving [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]], is thought to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, it is known as a \"Devonshire tea\".<ref>Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

As recently as the 19th century, a crowd of 17,000 at Devonport, near [[Plymouth]], attended a match between the champions of Devon and Cornwall. Another Devon sport was [[Cornish hurling|outhurling]] which was played in some regions until the 20th century (e.g. 1922, at Great Torrington). Other ancient customs which survive include [[Dartmoor]] step dancing, and \"[[Crying The Neck]]\".\n\nDevon has three professional football teams, based in each of its most populous towns and cities. As of the [[2017\u201318 in English football|2017/2018 football season]], [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]] compete in [[Football League One|English Football League One]] (the third tier of English professional football), [[Exeter City F.C.]] compete in [[Football League Two|English Football League Two]] (the fourth tier), while [[Torquay United F.C.]] compete in the [[Conference Premier|National League]] (the fifth tier).   Plymouth's highest Football League finish was fourth in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], which was achieved twice, in 1932 and 1953.   Torquay and Exeter have never progressed beyond the third tier of the league; Torquay finished second on [[goal average]] in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]] behind Sir [[Alf Ramsey]]'s [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1957.  Exeter's highest position has been eighth in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]].  The county's biggest non-league clubs are [[Bideford F.C.]] which competes in the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]], and [[Tiverton Town F.C.]] which is in the [[Southern Football League Division One South and West]].\n\n[[Rugby Union]] is very popular in Devon with over forty clubs under the banner of the [[Devon Rugby Football Union]], many with numerous teams at senior, youth and junior levels. One club \u2013 [[Exeter Chiefs]] play in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Aviva Premiership]], winning the title in 2017 for the first time in their history after beating [[Wasps RFC]] in the final 23-20. [[Plymouth Albion R.F.C.|Plymouth Albion]] who are, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, in the [[National League 1]] (The 3rd tier of English Professional Rugby Union.\nIn basketball, [[Plymouth Raiders]] play in the [[British Basketball League]].

[[Motorcycle speedway]] is also supported in the county, with both the [[Exeter Falcons]] and [[Plymouth Devils]] succeeding in the National Leagues in recent years.\n\nThere are five [[rugby league]] teams in Devon. [[Plymouth R.L.F.C|Plymouth Titans]], [[Exeter Centurions]], [[Torquay|Devon Sharks]] from Torquay, North Devon Raiders from Barnstaple and [[East Devon Eagles]] from Exmouth.

Protected by [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] status as '''Dartmoor National Park''', it covers {{convert|954|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"DF\" />\n\nThe [[granite]] which forms the [[highland (geography)|uplands]] dates from the [[Carboniferous]] Period of geological history. The moorland is capped with many exposed granite hilltops known as [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s, providing habitats for [[Dartmoor wildlife]]. The highest point is [[High Willhays]], {{convert|621|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The entire area is rich in antiquities and [[archaeology]].\n\nDartmoor is managed by the [[Dartmoor National Park Authority]], whose 22 members are drawn from [[Devon County Council]], local [[Districts of England|district councils]] and Government.\n\n[[Dartmoor Training Area|Parts of Dartmoor]] have been used as military [[firing range]]s for over 200 years. The public is granted extensive land access rights on Dartmoor (including restricted access to the firing ranges) and it is a popular tourist destination.\n\n==Physical geography==\n===Geology===\n[[File:Cornubian batholith.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Map showing the main granite outcrops of the [[Cornubian batholith]] in southwest England and the gravity anomaly associated with it.]]\n\nDartmoor includes the largest area of [[granite]] in Britain, with about {{convert|625|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} at the surface, though most of it is under superficial [[peat]] deposits. The granite (or more specifically [[adamellite]]) was intruded at depth as a [[pluton]] into the surrounding sedimentary rocks during the [[Carboniferous]] period, probably about 309 million years ago.<ref>Durrance & Laming 1982, pp.86, 101</ref> It is generally accepted that the present surface is not far below the original top of the pluton; evidence for this includes partly digested [[shale]] [[xenolith]]s, contamination of the granite and the existence of two patches of altered [[sedimentary rock]] on top of the granite.<ref>Durrance & Laming 1982, p.88</ref>\nA considerable [[gravity anomaly]] is associated with the Dartmoor pluton as with [[gravity anomalies of Britain and Ireland|other such plutons]].<ref>British Geological Survey 1997, ''Gravity Anomaly Map of Britain, Ireland and Adjacent Areas'', Smith & Edwards 1:500k</ref> Measurement of the anomaly has helped to determine the likely shape and extent of the rock mass at depth.\n\n===Tors===\n[[File:Saddle tor to Hey tor pano.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of some better known Dartmoor [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]] in snow]]\n[[File:High Willhays.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Willhays]] with Yes Tor behind]]\n\nDartmoor is known for its [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]]s \u2013 hills topped with outcrops of bedrock, which in [[granite]] country such as this are usually rounded boulder-like formations. More than 160 of the hills of Dartmoor have the word ''tor'' in their name but quite a number do not.<ref name=\"DF\" /> However this does not appear to relate to whether or not there is an outcrop of rock on their summit. The tors are the focus of an annual event known as the [[Ten Tors Challenge]], when around 2400 people aged between 14 and 19 walk for distances of 56, 72 or 88&nbsp;km (35, 45 or 55&nbsp;mi) between ten tors on many differing routes.\n\nThe highest points on Dartmoor are on the northern moor: [[High Willhays]], {{convert|621|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX580895}}) and [[Yes Tor]], {{convert|619|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX581901}}) The highest points on the southern moor are [[Ryder's Hill]], {{convert|515|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX660690}}), Snowdon {{convert|495|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX668684}}), and an unnamed point, {{convert|493|m|ft|abbr=on}} at ({{gbmapping|SX603645}}), between Langcombe Hill and Shell Top. The best-known tor on Dartmoor is [[Haytor]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bradt|first1=Hilary|last2=Booth|first2=Janice|title=South Devon & Dartmoor|date=2014|publisher=Bradt|location=Chalfont St Peter|isbn=9781841625522|page=222}}</ref> (called Hey Tor by William Crossing), {{convert|457|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX757771}}). For a more complete list see [[List of Dartmoor tors and hills]].\n\n===Rivers===\n[[File:ErmeIvybridge.jpg|thumb|[[River Erme]] at [[Ivybridge]].]]\n\nThe high ground of Dartmoor forms the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] for many of Devon's rivers. As well as shaping the landscape, these have traditionally provided a source of power for moor industries such as [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin mining]] and quarrying.\n\nThe moor takes its name from the [[River Dart]], which starts as the [[East Dart River|East Dart]] and [[West Dart River|West Dart]] and then becomes a single river at [[Dartmeet]]. It leaves the moor at [[Buckfastleigh]], flowing through [[Totnes]] below where it opens up into a long [[ria]], reaching the sea at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].\n\nFor a full list, expand the ''Rivers of Dartmoor'' navigational box at the bottom of this page.\n\n===Bogs===\nMuch more rain falls on Dartmoor than in the surrounding lowlands. As much of the national park is covered in thick layers of [[peat]] (decaying vegetation), the rain is usually absorbed quickly and distributed slowly, so the moor is rarely dry. In areas where water accumulates, dangerous [[bog]]s or mires can result. Some of these, topped with bright green moss, are known to locals as \"feather beds\" or \"quakers\", because they can shift (or 'quake') beneath a person's feet. Quakers result from sphagnum moss growing over the water that accumulates in the hollows in the granite.<ref>Ian Mercer: ''Bogs and Mires of Dartmoor'', in [[#refHW1977|Hunt & Wills 1977]], p.16.</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/bogs_moor.htm\n|title=The Bogs & Mires of Dartmoor\n|publisher=Legendary Dartmoor\n|accessdate=12 July 2009\n|last=Sandles\n|first=Tim}}</ref><ref>Crossing, W, ''Crossing's Guide to Dartmoor'' 1912 edition, published by Western Morning News Co. Ltd.</ref>\n\n[[File:Aune head mire3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aune Mire]], the source of the [[River Avon, Devon|River Avon.]]]]\nThe vegetation of the bogs depends on the type and location. [[Blanket bog]], which forms on the highest land where the rainfall exceeds {{convert|2000|mm|in}} a year, consists mainly of cotton-grass (''[[Eriophorum]]'' species), sedges (''[[Carex]]'' and ''[[Rhynchospora]]''), ''[[Narthecium ossifragum|Bog Asphodel]]'' and ''[[Common Tormentil]]'', with ''[[Sphagnum]]'' thriving in the wettest patches. The valley bogs have lush growth of [[Juncaceae|rushes]], with sphagnum, [[Erica tetralix|cross-leaved heath]], [[Drosera|sundews]] and several other species.<ref>{{cite book\n| last=Brunsden\n| first=Denys\n|author2=Gerrard, John\n| editor=Crispin Gill\n| title=Dartmoor.

[[Sabine Baring-Gould]], in his ''Book of Dartmoor'' (1900) related the story of a man who was making his way through Aune Mire at the head of the [[River Avon, Devon|River Avon]] when he came upon a top-hat brim down on the surface of the mire. He kicked it, whereupon a voice called out: \"What be you a-doin' to my 'at?\" The man replied, \"Be there now a chap under'n?\" \"Ees, I reckon,\" was the reply, \"and a hoss under me likewise.\"<ref>Milton 2006, p.2</ref><!-- mention \"Dartmoor Stables\" -->\n\n==Climate==\nAlong with the rest of [[South West England]], Dartmoor has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than locations at similar height in the rest of England. At [[Princetown]], near the centre of the moor at a height of {{convert|453|m|ft}}, January and February are the coldest months with mean minimum temperatures around {{convert|1|C|F|0}}. July and August are the warmest months with mean daily maxima not reaching {{convert|18|C}}. Compared with [[Teignmouth]], which is on the coast about {{convert|22|mi|km}} to the east, the average maximum and minimum temperatures are {{convert|3.0|C-change}} and {{convert|2.6|C-change}} lower respectively, and [[frost (temperature)|frost]] is at least five times as frequent.<ref name=\"W30\">Webb 2006, p.30</ref> On the highest ground, in the north of the moor, the [[growing season]] is less than 175 days \u2013 this contrasts with some 300 days along most of the south coast of the county.<ref name=\"W30\" />\n\n[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with Atlantic [[low-pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. The wettest months are November and December and on the highest parts of the moor the average annual total rainfall is over {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. This compares with less than {{convert|800|mm|in}} in the lower land to the east around the [[Exe Estuary]], which is in the [[rain shadow]] of the moor. Due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] snowfall is not common, though due to its high altitude it is more vulnerable to snowfall than surrounding regions.<ref name=\"W31\">Webb 2006, p.31</ref>\n\nBetween 1961 and 1990 [[Met Office]] data shows that there was an average of 20 days when snow fell on the moor, and over 40 days a year with hail, which is as high as anywhere else in the country. This results when cold [[air stream|polar maritime air]] that has travelled over a large expanse of warmer ocean is forced to rise over high country.<ref name=\"W31\" />\n\nWhen average temperatures at Princetown between 1961 and 2000 are compared, the average annual temperature in the decade 1990\u20132000 was up by {{convert|0.2|C-change|1}} and the late winter temperature increased by {{convert|0.5|C-change|1}}.<ref name=\"W32\">Webb 2006, pp.32\u201333</ref>\n<!-- give examples of some extreme conditions: ammil, long freeze in the 60s, etc.-->\n\n== Wildlife ==\nBecause of Dartmoor's height and granite geology, it experiences strong winds and has acidic soils. In consequence it has been subject to very little [[intensive farming]], and all these factors combine to form the basis of the important ecosystems found here. The landscape is one of granite with [[peat bog]]s overlying it. While the [[Moorland|moors]] topped with granite tors are the most iconic part of Dartmoor's landscape, only about half of Dartmoor is actually moorland. Equally important for wildlife are the [[blanket bog]]s, upland heaths and the oak woodlands which are all of global importance.<ref name=\"plantlife\">{{cite web|url= https://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/nature-reserves-important-plant-areas/important-plant-areas/dartmoor|title=Dartmoor IPA| website=Plantlife| accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref> Dartmoor is a [[Special Area of Conservation]] (SAC) with four habitats (''Northern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica tetralix''; ''European dry heaths''; ''Blanket bog''s and ''Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles'') being listed as primary reasons for the selection of Dartmoor as a SAC. In addition the area has a population of the [[Southern damselfly]] which is also a primary reason for its selection along with populations of [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] and [[Lutra lutra|Otter]] being qualifying reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/protectedsites/sacselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929| title= Dartmoor - Special Area of Conservation | website = Joint Nature Conservation Committee|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[Wistman's Wood]] is one of the old sessile oak woods which contribute to the listing of Dartmoor as a SAC and is possibly a surviving fragment from the earliest [[Neolithic]] woodland clearances. It is home to exceptional epiphytic mosses, liverworts and lichens. Nearly 50 species of moss and liverwort are found in the wood along with 120 types of [[lichen]], including Smith\u2019s horsehair lichen, speckled sea-storm lichen and pendulous wing-moss. Over 60 species of lichens grow on the exposed surfaces of the granite tors, including granite-speck rim-lichen, purple rock lichen, [[Acarospora fuscata|brown cobblestone lichen]] and goldspot lichen and many rare lichen grow on rocks exposed by mining which are rich in [[heavy metals]]. On the upland heaths heather ([[Calluna|ling]]) and [[bell heather]] are common along with [[western gorse]]. In dry grassy areas [[tormentil]], [[heath bedstraw]] and [[heath milkwort]] are all common. [[Cross-leaved heath]] and [[purple moor grass]] grow in wetter spots and in the boggy areas many different species of [[sphagnum]] and other mosses can be found along with [[liverwort]]s, [[Hare's-tail Cotton-grass]], [[round-leaved sundew]] and [[bog asphodel]] and in the valley bottoms, many different [[sedge]]s, [[bogbean]] and [[pale butterwort]] all grow.<ref name=\"plantlife\" />\n\nA large variety of bird species can be found on Dartmoor including ones that have declined elsewhere in the UK, such as [[skylark]] and [[snipe]], or are even rare nationally, such as the [[ring ouzel]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]. There are internationally important populations of [[meadow pipit]] and [[stonechat]].  Woodland birds include a number of migrant species, like the [[pied flycatcher]], the [[wood warbler]] or the [[common redstart]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/birds| title=Birds| website = Dartmoor National Park| accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref> Mammals found here include otters, hazel dormice and nearly all of the UKs 16 bat species. Three rare species, the [[barbastelle]], and the [[greater horseshoe bat|greater]] and [[lesser horseshoe bat]]s are of particular importance. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/mammals| title=Mammals| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref> The upper reaches of the rivers, are spawning grounds for Salmon and [[trout]] and [[Palmate newt]]s, frogs and toads breed in the numerous small pools. Two shrimp species can be found on Dartmoor: [[fairy shrimp]] that can be found in temporary pools and in underground streams very rare Cave shrimp. The world\u2019s largest land slug, the [[Limax cinereoniger|Ash black]], is also found. Reptiles include [[Common lizard]]s and [[Vipera berus|adders]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/other-animals| title=Other animals| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref> The farmland in the wet valleys around the edge of the moors is the most important habitat for insects\nincluding the [[marsh fritillary]] butterfly, southern damselfly, [[Hemaris tityus|narrow-bordered bee hawkmoth]] and [[Eristalis cryptarum|bog hoverfly]]. Areas of [[bracken]] are home to the [[high brown fritillary]] and [[pearl-bordered fritillary]]. Insects found in the heathlands include the [[emperor moth]], [[green hairstreak]] and the [[bilberry bumblebee]]. The old oak woodlands have a distinctive group of insects including the [[blue ground beetle]] and Heckford\u2019s pygmy moth, a species found nowhere else in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/insects| title=Insects| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history===\nThe majority of the [[prehistoric]] remains on Dartmoor date back to the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. Indeed, Dartmoor contains the largest concentration of Bronze Age remains in the United Kingdom, which suggests that this was when a larger population moved onto the hills of Dartmoor. The large systems of Bronze Age fields, divided by [[reave]]s, cover an area of over {{convert|10000|ha|mi2}} of the lower moors.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/lookingafter/laf-culturalheritage/laf-archaeology/laf-prehistoricdartmoor.htm\n|title=Prehistoric Dartmoor\n|publisher=Dartmoor National Park Authority\n|accessdate=2 September 2009\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201085932/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/lookingafter/laf-culturalheritage/laf-archaeology/laf-prehistoricdartmoor.htm\n|archivedate=1 December 2009\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe climate at the time was warmer than today, and much of today's moorland was covered with trees. The prehistoric settlers began clearing the forest, and established the first farming communities. Fire was the main method of clearing land, creating [[pasture]] and [[swidden]] types of fire-fallow farmland. Areas less suited for farming tended to be burned for livestock grazing. Over the centuries these Neolithic practices greatly expanded the upland moors, and contributed to the acidification of the soil and the accumulation of [[peat]] and [[bog]]s.<ref>Role of anthropogenic fire and in creating moors, and moor-burning in sustaining them, described in [[#refPyne1997|Pyne 1997]], pp. 348\u2212369.</ref>\n\nAfter a few thousand years the mild climate deteriorated leaving these areas uninhabited and consequently relatively undisturbed to the present day. The highly acidic soil has ensured that no organic remains have survived, but the durability of the granite has meant that the remains of buildings, enclosures and monuments have survived well, as have flint tools. It should be noted that a number of remains were \"restored\" by enthusiastic [[Victorians]] and that, in some cases, they have placed their own interpretation on how an area may have looked.\n\n===Standing stones===\n[[File:Beardown man dartmoor.jpg|thumb|upright|Beardown Man, Dartmoor.]]\n\nNumerous prehistoric [[menhir]]s (more usually referred to locally as [[standing stone]]s or longstones), [[stone circle]]s, [[Dartmoor kistvaens|kistvaen]]s, [[cairn]]s and [[stone row]]s are to be found on the moor. The most significant sites include:\n\n*Upper Erme stone row is the longest on Dartmoor and in fact in the world at {{convert|3300|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Beardown Man, near Devil's Tor \u2013 isolated standing stone {{convert|3.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, said to have another {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below ground. {{gbmapping|SX596796}}\n*Challacombe, near the prehistoric settlement of [[Grimspound]] \u2014 triple stone row. {{gbmapping|SX689807}}\n*[[Drizzlecombe]], east of [[Sheepstor]] village \u2013 stone rows, standing stones, kistvaens and cairns. {{gbmapping|SX591669}}\n*[[Grey Wethers]], near [[Postbridge, Devon|Postbridge]] \u2014 double circle, aligned almost exactly north south. {{gbmapping|SX638831}}\n*Laughter Tor, near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]] \u2014 standing stone {{convert|2.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high and two double stone rows, one {{convert|164|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. {{gbmapping|SX652753}}\n*[[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]], between [[Princetown]] and [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] \u2014 includes a double stone row {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, aligned almost exactly east-west), stone circles and a kistvaen. {{gbmapping|SX554747}}\n*[[Scorhill]] (pronounced 'Scorill'), west of [[Chagford]] \u2014 circle, {{convert|26.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in circumference, and stone rows. {{gbmapping|SX654873}}\n*[[Shovel Down]], north of [[Dartmoor reservoirs|Fernworthy reservoir]] \u2014 double stone row approximately {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. {{gbmapping|SX660859}}\n*[[Yellowmead Down]], a quadruple concentric stone circle and stone rows.\n\n===Hut circles and kistvaens===\nThere are also an estimated 5,000 [[hut circle]]s still surviving although many have been raided over the centuries by the builders of the traditional dry stone walls. These are the remnants of [[Bronze Age]] houses. The smallest are around {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the largest may be up to five times this size.\n\nSome have L-shaped porches to protect against wind and rain; some particularly good examples are to be found at [[Grimspound]]. It is believed that they would have had a conical roof, supported by timbers and covered in turf or thatch.\n\nThere are also numerous [[Dartmoor kistvaens|kistvaens]], Neolithic stone box-like tombs.\n\n===The historical period===\n[[File:Crazywell cross 1.JPG|thumb|Ancient cross close to [[Crazywell Pool]]]]\n\nThe climate became wetter and cooler{{clarify|date=July 2013}} over the course of a thousand years from around 1000&nbsp;BC, resulting in much of high Dartmoor being largely abandoned by its early inhabitants.\n\nIt was not until the [[early Mediaeval]] period that the weather again became warmer, and settlers moved back onto the moors. Like their ancient forebears, they also used the natural granite to build their homes, preferring a style known as the [[Dartmoor longhouse|longhouse]] \u2014 some of which are still inhabited today, although they have been clearly adapted over the centuries. Many are now being used as farm buildings, while others were abandoned and fell into ruin.\n\nThe earliest surviving farms, still in operation today, are known as the [[Ancient Tenements]]. Most of these date back to the 14th century and sometimes earlier.\n\nSome way into the moor stands the town of [[Princetown, England|Princetown]], the site of [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]], which was originally built by Isbell Rowe & Company, Plymouth, for [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]]. The prison has an incorrect reputation for being escape-proof, due to both the buildings themselves and its physical location.\n\nThe Dartmoor landscape is scattered with the marks left by the many generations who have lived and worked there over the centuries \u2013 such as the remains of the [[Dartmoor tin-mining]] industry, and farmhouses long since abandoned. Indeed, the [[industrial archaeology of Dartmoor]] is a subject in its own right.\n\n==Myths and literature==\n[[File:Jay's Grave, geograph.jpg|thumb|[[Jay's Grave]].]]\n\nDartmoor is known for its myths and legends. It is reputedly the haunt of [[pixie]]s, a [[headless horseman]], a mysterious pack of \"[[Hellhound|spectral hounds]]\", and a large [[black dog (ghost)|black dog]], among others. During [[The Great Thunderstorm, Widecombe|the Great Thunderstorm]] of 1638, the moorland village of [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]] was even said to have been visited by the [[Devil]].\n\nMany landmarks have ancient legends and [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] stories associated with them, such as the allegedly haunted [[Jay's Grave]], the ancient burial site of [[Childe's Tomb]], the rock pile called [[Bowerman's Nose]], and the [[Dartmoor crosses|stone crosses]] that mark former mediaeval routes across the moor.\n\nA few stories have emerged in recent decades, such as the \"[[hairy hands]]\", that are said to attack motorists on the B3212 near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]];<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/hairy_hands.htm\n|title=The Hairy Hands\n|publisher=Legendary Dartmoor\n|accessdate=7 August 2010\n|last=Sandles\n|first=Tim}}</ref> and the \"Beast of Dartmoor\", [[British big cats|a supposed big cat]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/beast_dart.htm \n |title=The Legendary Beast of Dartmoor \n |publisher=Legendary Dartmoor \n |accessdate=7 August 2010 \n |last=Sandles \n |first=Tim \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823061015/http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/beast_dart.htm \n |archivedate=23 August 2010 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nDartmoor has inspired a number of artists and writers, such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] in ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' and ''[[The Adventure of Silver Blaze]]'', [[R. D. Blackmore]], [[Eden Phillpotts]], [[Beatrice Chase]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Rosamunde Pilcher]], and the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', the fictional 1994 Quidditch World Cup final between Ireland and Bulgaria was hosted on the moor.\n\n==Ownership and access==\nOver half of Dartmoor National Park (57.3%) is private land; the [[Forest of Dartmoor]] being the major part of this, owned by the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] owns 14% (see below), 3.8% is owned by water companies (see [[Dartmoor reservoirs]]), 3.7% by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], 1.8% by the [[Forestry Commission]] and 1.4% by Dartmoor's [[national park authority]]. About 37% of Dartmoor is [[common land]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/lab-comm.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dartmoor Commons |publisher=Dartmoor National Park Authority |accessdate=19 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227004835/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/lab-comm.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nDartmoor differs from some other [[National parks of England and Wales|National Parks in England and Wales]], in that since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> much of it has been designated as 'Access Land', which, although it remains privately owned, has no restrictions on where walkers can roam. In addition to this Access Land, there are about {{convert|730|km|-1|abbr=on}} of [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public rights of way]] on Dartmoor, and many kilometres of permitted footpaths and bridleways where the owner allows access.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/vi-prow \n |title=Public Rights of Way \n |publisher=Dartmoor National Park Authority \n |accessdate=14 July 2009 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911075542/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/vi-prow \n |archivedate=11 September 2009 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n=== Use by the Ministry of Defence ===\n{{See also|Dartmoor Training Area}}\n\nThere is a tradition of military usage of Dartmoor dating back to the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Today, a large British Army training camp remains at [[Okehampton]] \u2014 also the site of an airbase during the Second World War.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) uses three areas of the northern moor for manoeuvres and live-firing exercises, totalling {{convert|108.71|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"DF\" /> or just over 11% of the National Park. Red and white posts mark the boundaries of these military areas (shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:25,000 scale maps). Flagpoles on many tors in and around the ranges fly red flags when firing is taking place. At other times, members of the public are allowed access. Blank rounds may also be used, but the MoD does not notify the public of this in advance.\n\nSome \"challenge\" and charitable events take place with assistance of the military on Dartmoor including the long established [[Ten Tors]] event and the more recent [[Dartmoor Beast]].<ref>http://www.tentors.org.uk/challenge/about</ref>\n\nDartmoor's fictional use as an MoD centre for animal testing called Baskerville was referenced in the BBC drama ''Sherlock'' episode \"[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]\".\n\nThe disused [[Rippon Tor Rifle Range]] was built to train soldiers during the Second World War, and remained in use until its closure in 1977.<ref>http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV55113&resourceID=104</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:Dartmoor Clapper Bridge mod.jpg|thumb|The clapper bridge at [[Postbridge]].]]\n[[File:Dartmoor pony 1.jpg|thumb|Dartmoor Hill pony on Dartmoor.]]\n\nThroughout human history, the landscape has been exploited for industrial purposes. In recent years, controversy has surrounded the work of industrial conglomerates [[Imerys]] and Sibelco (formerly Watts Blake Bearne), who have used parts of the moor for [[china clay]] mining. Licences were granted by the [[British Government]] but were recently renounced after sustained public pressure from bodies such as the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmoorsociety.com/files/debates/chinaclay.html|title=The 7th Dartmoor Society Debate: How Important is China Clay to Dartmoor?|last=Hedges|first=Mike|date=2004|website=The Dartmoor Society|access-date=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe British government has made promises to protect the integrity of the moor; however, the cost of compensating companies for these licences, which may not have been granted in today's political climate, could prove prohibitive.\n\n\nThe military use of the moor has been another source of controversy, such as when training was extended in January 2003. The [[national park authority]] received 1,700 objections before making the decision. Objectors claimed that Dartmoor should be an area for recreation, and that the training disturbs the peace.\n\nThose who objected included the [[Open Spaces Society]] and the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]]. During her lifetime, [[Sylvia Sayer|Lady Sayer]] was another outspoken critic of the damage which she perceived that the army was doing to the moor.\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:Saddle tor evening.jpg|thumb|A typical Dartmoor tor close to [[Haytor]].]]\n\nDartmoor has a resident population of about 33,000,<ref name=\"DF\" /> which swells considerably during holiday periods with incoming tourists. The largest settlements within the National Park are [[Ashburton, Devon|Ashburton]] (the largest with a population of about 3,500), [[Buckfastleigh]], [[Moretonhampstead]], [[Princetown]], [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]], [[Horrabridge]], [[South Brent]], [[Christow]], and [[Chagford]].<ref name=\"DF\" />\n\nFor a full list, expand the ''Settlements of Dartmoor'' navigational box at the bottom of this page.\n\n==Landmarks==\n{{See also|List of Dartmoor tors and hills}}\n[[File:Ponies on Trendlebere Down.jpg|thumb|Ponies on Trendlebere Down]]\n[[File:Sherwell Cross, near Corndon Tor.

His ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', originally called ''{{lang|it|Comed\u00eca}}'' (modern Italian: ''Commedia'') and later christened ''{{lang|it|Divina}}'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the [[Italian language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=The Western Canon|year=1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Prue|title=Reading Dante: From Here to Eternity|date=2014|publisher=Liveright Publishign Corporation|location=New York|isbn=9780871407429|pages=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nIn the late [[Middle Ages]], most poetry was written in [[Latin]], accessible only to the most educated readers. In ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular''), however, Dante defended the use of the [[vernacular]] in literature. He would even write in the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and the ''Divine Comedy''; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and Boccaccio would follow. \n\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Heaven]] provided inspiration for the larger body of [[Western art]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Haller |first=Elizabeth K. |editor-first=Lister M. |editor-last=Matheson |title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rETxD8KcnUIC&pg=PA244 |volume=1 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA |date=2012 |page=244 |chapter=Dante Alighieri |isbn=978-0-313-34080-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Human accomplishment : the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950|last=A.|first=Murray, Charles|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060192471|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=52047270}}</ref> He is cited as an influence on [[John Milton]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the ''[[terza rima]]'', is attributed to him.  In Italy, he is often referred to as ''{{lang|it|il Sommo Poeta}}'' (\"the Supreme Poet\") and ''{{lang|it|il Poeta}}''; he, [[Petrarch]], and Boccaccio are also called \"the three fountains\" or \"the three crowns\".\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nDante was born in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the ''[[Divine Comedy]].'' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"'' (\"Midway upon the journey of our life\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10<!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 -->, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: \"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\" (XXII&nbsp;151\u2013154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 ([[Julian calendar]]).<ref>His birth date is listed as \"probably in the end of May\" by Robert Hollander in \"Dante\" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume&nbsp;4. According to Boccaccio, the poet himself said he was born in May. See \"Alighieri, Dante\" in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani.''</ref>\n\n[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\"<Ref>Holbrook, Richard. \"Portraits of Dante from Giotto to Raffael: a critical study, with a concise iconography\". 1911.

Dante's father, Alighiero<ref name=Trecc/> or [[Alighiero di Bellincione]], was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Santagata |first=Marco |date=2012 |title=Dante: Il romanzo della sua vita |url= |location=Milan |publisher=Mondadori |page=21 |isbn=978-8804620266 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family.<ref name=Trecc/> She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.<ref name=Trecc>{{cite book|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-alighieri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Alighieri, Dante|first=S.A|last=Chimenz|language=Italian|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[civil law notary|notary]]. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).<ref name=Trecc/>\n[[File:Antonio Cotti - Dante a Verona.jpg|thumbnail|''Dante in Verona'', by Antonio Cotti]]\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289).<ref name=\"Davenport2005\">{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=John|title=Dante: Poet, Author, and Proud Florentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWWKW15MjqMC&pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0415-7|page=53|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref> This victory brought about a reformation of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298\u20131300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\n\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]], Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\n\n===Education and poetry===\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet [[Guido Guinizelli]]\u2014whom in ''Purgatorio'' XXVI he characterized as his \"father\"\u2014at a time when the [[Sicilian school]] (''Scuola poetica Siciliana''), a cultural group from [[Sicily]], was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan|Proven\u00e7al]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dante-alighieri|title=Dante Alighieri|last=Alighieri|first=Dante|date=October 29, 2007|website=Dante Alighieri|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]\nDante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \"[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]\", apparently without even talking with her.<ref>{{cite book |title= Delphi Complete Works of Dante Alighieri |edition= Illustrated |volume= 6 |author= Dante Alighieri |publisher= Delphi Classics |year= 2013 |isbn= 9781909496194}}</ref> He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Proven\u00e7al poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore''). Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.<ref>{{cite book |title= Names and Naming in Young Adult Literature |volume= 27 |author= Alleen Pace Nilsen, Don L. F.

To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\n[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|Dante Alighieri, detail from [[Luca Signorelli]]'s fresco, [[Chapel of San Brizio]], [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]\n\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')\u2014Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi\u2014and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\n\n===Exile and death===\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante dei Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.<ref>[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''</ref> Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.<ref>Robert Harrison, \"Dante on Trial\", ''NY Review of Books'', February 19, 2015, pp. 36\u201337</ref> The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \"suggested\" that Dante stay.

He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)<ref>Malcolm Moore [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante's-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html \"Dante's infernal crimes forgiven\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', June 17, 2008.

Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first occurring in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\" in March 1311.\n\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII.\n\n[[File:Dante Alighieri Florence Firenze JBU01.JPG|thumb|[[Monument to Dante|Statue of Dante]] in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]] in Florence, [[Enrico Pazzi]], 1865]]\n\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy'', but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c. 1304\u201307) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\n\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \"Comedy\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.<ref>See [http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/francesco-daccorso-tf/ Bookrags.com] and Tigerstedt, E.N. 1967, ''Dante; Tiden Mannen Verket'' (''Dante; The Age, the Man, the Work''), Bonniers, Stockholm, 1967. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the ''Inferno'' or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier ''Officiolum'' [c. 1305\u201308], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spolia.it/online/en/argomenti/letterature_romanze/filologia/2003/barberino.htm|title=L\u2032''Officiolum'' ritrovato di Francesco da Barberino|author=Fabio M. Bertolo|year= 2003|work=Spolia&nbsp;\u2013 Journal of Medieval Studies|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>) We know that the ''Inferno'' had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from [[Bologna]], but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. ''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously.\n\nIn Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\n\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again.

Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).\n\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr.

But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in ''Paradiso'', XVII (55\u201360), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\n[[File:DanteFresco.jpg|thumb|left|Mural of Dante in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], by [[Andrea del Castagno]], c. 1450]]\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|it|...

He finished ''Paradiso'' and died in 1321 (aged 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, possibly of [[malaria]] contracted there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called San Francesco).

The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta''\u2014which roughly translates as \"Honor the most exalted poet\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno,'' depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, ''L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita'' (\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\n\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named ''[[Italian battleship Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'' in honor of him.\n\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, [[Pope Benedict XV]] promulgated an encyclical named ''[[In praeclara summorum]]'', calling him one \"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\" and the \"pride and glory of humanity\".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_30041921_in-praeclara-summorum_en.html \"''In praeclara summorum'': Encyclical of Pope Benedict XV on Dante\"].

While the vision of Hell, the ''Inferno,'' is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. ''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \"all'alta fantasia qui manc\u00f2 possa\"\u2014\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\" ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).\n\n[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|left|Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the [[incipit]] ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence, 1465.]]\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range\u2014both stylistic and thematic\u2014of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\n\nHe wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called \"Italian\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Britannica|151164|Dante}}</ref> He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the [[Italian language]] was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante''. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in [[Roman Catholic]] Western Europe (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the \"original genius\" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\n\n[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|right|''Dante Alighieri'', attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been heavily restored.]]\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \"comedy\". [[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\n\n[[File:Monument to Dante (Verona).jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Dante Alighieri in [[Verona]]]]\nDante's other works include ''[[Convivio]]'' (\"The Banquet\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=2&idlang=UK|title=Banquet|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; ''[[De Monarchia]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=4&idlang=UK|title=Monarchia|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}</ref> a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death<ref>Anthony K.

The ''Vita Nuova'' contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular\u2014both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio''\u2014instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.

Several of his professors came forward, arguing that his ability to write [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]] more than compensated, and demonstrated his familiarity with music notation. The college was still afraid that it would cause a scandal, and agreed to let Brubeck graduate only after he had promised never to teach piano.<ref name=\"Cowboy to Jazzman\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMan/cowboyToJazzman.htm |title=Rediscovering Dave Brubeck &#124; The Man &#124; With Hedrick Smith |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating in 1942, Brubeck was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. He served in Europe in the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]]. He volunteered to play piano at a [[Red Cross]] show and was such a hit that he was spared from combat service and ordered to form a band. He created one of the U.S. armed forces' first [[racial integration|racially integrated]] bands, \"The Wolfpack\".<ref name=\"Cowboy to Jazzman\"/> While serving in the military, Brubeck met [[Paul Desmond]] in early 1944.<ref>Liner notes to the album ''25th Anniversary Reunion'', Dave Brubeck Quartet</ref> He returned to college after serving nearly four years in the army, this time attending [[Mills College]] in Oakland. He studied under [[Darius Milhaud]], who encouraged him to study [[fugue]] and [[orchestration]], but not classical piano. While on active duty, he received two lessons from [[Arnold Schoenberg]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in an attempt to connect with [[High modernism|high modernist]] theory and practice.<ref>Starr, Kevin. 2009.

In it, Jesus's twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|disciples]] are introduced each singing their own individual notes; it is described as \u201cquite dramatic, especially when Judas starts singing 'Repent' on a high and straining dissonant note.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/my-mentor-my-collaborator-my-father-dave-brubeck/|title=My Mentor, My Collaborator, My Father: Dave Brubeck|author=Chris Brubeck|publisher=Newmusicbox.org|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter completing his studies under Milhaud, Brubeck worked with an [[Octet (music)|octet]] (the recording bears his name only because Brubeck was the best-known member at the time), and a [[Trio (music)|trio]] including [[Cal Tjader]] and Ron Crotty. Highly experimental, the group made few recordings and got even fewer paying jobs. The trio was often joined by Paul Desmond on the bandstand, at Desmond's own insistence.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nJack Sheedy owned San Francisco-based Coronet Records, which had previously recorded area [[Dixieland]] bands. (This Coronet Records should not be confused with either the late 1950s New York-based budget label, nor with Australia-based [[Coronet Records]].) In 1949, Sheedy was talked into making the first recording of Brubeck's octet and later his trio. But Sheedy was unable to pay his bills and in 1949 turned his masters over to his record stamping company, the Circle Record Company, owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers soon changed the name of their business to [[Fantasy Records]].\n\nThese initial Brubeck records sold well, and he recorded and issued new records for Fantasy. Soon the company was shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records each quarter, making enormous profits.<ref>Gioia, Ted. \"Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco\" in ''West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945\u20131960'', University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\n==Dave Brubeck Quartet==\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Dave Brubeck Quartet\n| image               = Davebrubeckquartet1967a.jpg\n| caption             = The Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1967; left to right: Joe Morello, Eugene Wright, Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond\n| image_size          = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = \n| origin              = [[San Francisco]], California, United States\n| instrument          = \n| genre               = [[Jazz]]\n| occupation          = \n| years_active        = 1951\u20132012\n| label               = \n| associated_acts     = \n| website             = [http://www.davebrubeck.com/live/ davebrubeck.com]\n| current_members     = \n| past_members        = Dave Brubeck<br />[[Paul Desmond]]<br />[[Bob Bates (musician)|Bob Bates]]<br />[[Joe Dodge]]<br />[[Ron Crotty]]<br />[[Lloyd Davis]]<br />[[Joe Morello]]<br />[[Norman Bates (musician)|Norman Bates]]<br />[[Eugene Wright]]<br />[[Gerry Mulligan]]<br />[[Jack Six]]<br />[[Alan Dawson]]<br />[[Darius Brubeck]]<br />[[Chris Brubeck]]<br />[[Dan Brubeck]]<br />[[Bobby Militello]]<br />[[Alec Dankworth]]<br/>[[Michael Moore (bassist)|Michael Moore]]<br />[[Randy Jones (drummer)|Randy Jones]]\n}}\n[[File:BrubeckQuartet.JPG|thumb|The quartet in 1959 during the ''Time Out'' sessions.

He would later remark that the rescue workers who responded had described him as a \"DOA\" (dead on arrival). Brubeck recovered after a few months, but suffered with residual nerve pain in his hands for years after.<ref name=washpost /> The injury also influenced his playing style towards complex, blocky chords rather than speedy, high-dexterity, single-note runs.\n\nBrubeck organized the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951, with [[Paul Desmond]] on alto saxophone. They took up a long residency at San Francisco's [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk nightclub]] and gained great popularity touring college campuses, recording a series of albums with such titles as ''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]'' (1953), ''[[Jazz at the College of the Pacific]]'' (1953), and Brubeck's debut on [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]'' (1954).\n\nWhen Brubeck signed with [[Fantasy Records]], he thought he had a half interest in the company and he worked as a sort of [[Artists and repertoire|A & R]] man for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Red Norvo]]. When he discovered that all he owned was a half interest in his own recording, he quit to sign with another label, [[Columbia Records]].<ref>\"The San Francisco Scene in the 1950s,\" West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945\u20131960, Ted Gioia, University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the second jazz musician to be so honored (the first was [[Louis Armstrong]] on February 21, 1949).<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19490221,00.html ''Time'' magazine cover: Louis Armstrong] \u2013 February 21, 1949</ref> Brubeck personally found this accolade embarrassing, since he considered [[Duke Ellington]] more deserving of it and was convinced that he had been favored for being Caucasian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=1959: The Year that Changed Everything|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Songs|page=131}}</ref> Ellington himself knocked on the door of Brubeck's hotel room to show him the cover and the only reaction Brubeck could give was, \u201cIt should have been you.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Sample Liner Notes by Darius Brubeck|year=2007|accessdate=December 23, 2012|work=Dave Brubeck Live IN '64 & '66|url=http://www.jazzicons.com/ji2_brubeck.html}}</ref>\n\nEarly bassists for the group included Ron Crotty, Bob Bates and his brother Norman Bates; Lloyd Davis and Joe Dodge held the drum chair.

The soundtrack album, which featured [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]], and [[Carmen McRae]] was recorded in 1961; the musical was performed at the 1962 [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].\n\n[[File:Dave Brubeck (1964).jpg|thumb|Brubeck in 1964]]\nAt its peak in the early 1960s, the Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Apart from the \"College\" and the \"Time\" series, Brubeck recorded four [[LP album|LPs]] featuring his compositions based on the group's travels, and the local music they encountered. ''[[Jazz Impressions of the U.S.A.]]'' (1956, Morello's debut with the group), ''Jazz Impressions of Eurasia'' (1958), ''[[Jazz Impressions of Japan]]'' (1964), and ''[[Jazz Impressions of New York]]'' (1964) are less well-known albums, but all are brilliant examples of the quartet's studio work, and they produced Brubeck standards such as \"Summer Song\", \"Brandenburg Gate\", \"Koto Song\", and \"Theme From Mr. Broadway\". (Brubeck wrote, and the Quartet performed, the theme song for this [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]] CBS drama series; the music from the series became material for the ''New York'' album.) In 1961, Brubeck appeared in a few scenes of the British jazz/beat film ''[[All Night Long (1962 film)|All Night Long]]'', which starred [[Patrick McGoohan]] and [[Richard Attenborough]]. Brubeck merely plays himself, with the film featuring [[close-up]]s of his piano fingerings. Brubeck performs \"It's a Raggy Waltz\" from the ''Time Further Out'' album and duets briefly with bassist [[Charles Mingus]] in \"Non-Sectarian Blues\".\n\nIn the early 1960s Dave Brubeck was the program director of WJZZ-FM radio (now [[WEZN-FM]]).

Plant-based dyes such as [[isatis tinctoria|woad]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]], [[Saffron (use)|saffron]], and [[rubia|madder]] were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using [[resist dyeing]] techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth.

Attachment to the fiber is attributed, at least partly, to salt formation between anionic groups in the dyes and [[cationic]] groups in the fiber. Acid dyes are not substantive to [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] fibers. Most synthetic food colors fall in this category. Examples of acid dye are Alizarine Pure Blue B, [[Acid red 88]], etc. \n\n'''Basic dyes''' are water-soluble [[cationic]] dyes that are mainly applied to [[acrylic fiber]]s, but find some use for wool and silk. Usually [[acetic acid]] is added to the dye bath to help the uptake of the dye onto the fiber. Basic dyes are also used in the coloration of [[paper]].\n\n'''Direct''' or '''[[substantive dye]]ing''' is normally carried out in a neutral or slightly [[alkaline]] dye bath, at or near [[boiling point]], with the addition of either [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) or [[sodium sulfate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Direct dyes are used on [[cotton]], paper, [[leather]], wool, silk and [[nylon]]. They are also used as [[pH indicator]]s and as [[staining (biology)|biological stains]].\n\n'''[[Mordant dye]]s''' require a [[mordant]], which improves the fastness of the dye against water, [[light]] and [[perspiration]]. The choice of mordant is very important as different mordants can change the final color significantly. Most natural dyes are mordant dyes and there is therefore a large literature base describing dyeing techniques. The most important mordant dyes are the synthetic mordant dyes, or chrome dyes, used for wool; these comprise some 30% of dyes used for wool, and are especially useful for black and navy shades. The mordant [[potassium dichromate]] is applied as an after-treatment.  It is important to note that many mordants, particularly those in the heavy metal category, can be hazardous to health and extreme care must be taken in using them.\n\n'''[[Vat dye]]s''' are essentially insoluble in water and incapable of dyeing fibres directly. However, reduction in [[alkaline liquor]] produces the water-soluble [[alkali]] [[metal]] [[salt]] of the dye. This form is often colorless, in which case it is referred to as a [[Leuco dye]], and has an affinity for the textile fibre. Subsequent [[oxidation]] reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to [[Indigo dye|indigo]], the original vat dye.\n\n'''[[Reactive dyes]]''' utilize a [[chromophore]] attached to a [[substituent]] that is capable of directly [[chemical reaction|reacting]] with the fiber substrate. The [[covalent]] bonds that attach reactive dye to natural fibers make them among the most permanent of dyes. \"Cold\" reactive dyes, such as [[Procion MX]], [[Cibacron F]], and [[Drimarene K]], are very easy to use because the dye can be applied at room temperature. Reactive dyes are by far the best choice for dyeing [[cotton]] and other [[cellulose]] fibers at home or in the art studio.\n\n'''[[Disperse dye]]s''' were originally developed for the dyeing of [[cellulose acetate]], and are water-insoluble. The dyes are finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye [[polyester]], but they can also be used to dye nylon, [[cellulose triacetate]], and acrylic fibers. In some cases, a dyeing [[temperature]] of {{convert|130|C|F}} is required, and a pressurized dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.\n\n'''Azoic dyeing''' is a technique in which an insoluble [[Azo dye]] is produced directly onto or within the fiber. This is achieved by treating a fiber with both diazoic and coupling [[wikt:component|components]]. With suitable adjustment of dyebath conditions the two components react to produce the required insoluble azo dye. This technique of dyeing is unique, in that the final color is controlled by the choice of the diazoic and coupling components. This method of dyeing cotton is declining in importance due to the toxic nature of the chemicals used.\n\n'''[[Sulfur dye]]s''' are inexpensive dyes used to dye cotton with dark colors. Dyeing is effected by heating the fabric in a solution of an organic compound, typically a nitrophenol derivative, and sulfide or [[polysulfide]].  The organic compound reacts with the sulfide source to form dark colors that adhere to the fabric. Sulfur Black 1, the largest selling dye by volume, does not have a well defined chemical structure.\n\n==Food dyes==\nOne other class that describes the role of dyes, rather than their mode of use, is the [[food coloring|food dye]].  Because food dyes are classed as [[food additive]]s, they are manufactured to a higher standard than some industrial dyes. Food dyes can be direct, mordant and vat dyes, and their use is strictly controlled by [[law|legislation]]. Many are [[Azo compound|azo]] dyes, although [[anthraquinone]] and [[triphenylmethane]] compounds are used for colors such as [[green]] and [[blue]].

The following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists.\n\n== Separable first-order ordinary differential equations ==\n{{see also|Separable partial differential equation}}\nEquations in the form <math>\\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)</math> are called separable and solved by <math>\\frac {dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx</math> and thus \n<math>\\int\\frac {dy}{g(y)} = \\int f(x)dx</math>. Prior to dividing by <math>g(y)</math>, one needs to check if there are stationary (also called equilibrium)\nsolutions <math>y=const</math> satisfying <math>g(y)=0</math>.\n\n==Separable (homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations==\n{{see also|Separable partial differential equation}}\nA separable ''linear'' [[ordinary differential equation]] of the first order \nmust be homogeneous and has the general form\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = 0</math>\n\nwhere <math>f(t)</math> is some known [[function (mathematics)|function]].  We may solve this by [[separation of variables]] (moving the ''y'' terms to one side and the ''t'' terms to the other side),\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{y} = -f(t)\\, dt</math>\n\nSince the separation of variables in this case involves dividing by ''y'', we must check if the constant function ''y=0'' is a solution of the original equation. Trivially, if ''y=0'' then ''y'=0'', so ''y=0'' is actually a solution of the original equation. We note that ''y=0'' is not allowed in the transformed equation.\n\nWe solve the transformed equation with the variables already separated by [[Integral Calculus|Integrating]],\n\n:<math>\\ln |y| = \\left(-\\int f(t)\\,dt\\right) + C</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is an arbitrary constant. Then, by [[exponentiation]], we obtain\n\n:<math>y = \\pm e^{\\left(-\\int f(t)\\,dt\\right) + C} = \\pm e^{C} e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt}</math>.\n\nHere, <math>e^{C}>0</math>, so <math>\\pm e^{C}\\neq 0</math>. But we have independently checked that ''y=0'' is also a solution of the original equation, thus \n:<math>y = A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt}</math>.\nwith an arbitrary constant ''A'', which covers all the cases. It is easy to confirm that this is a solution by plugging it into the original differential equation:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = -f(t) \\cdot A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt} + f(t) \\cdot A e^{-\\int f(t)\\,dt} = 0</math>\n\nSome elaboration is needed because ''&fnof;''(''t'')  might not even be integrable. One must also assume something about the domains of the functions involved before the equation is fully defined. The solution above assumes the [[real number|real]] case.\n\nIf <math>f(t)=\\alpha</math> is a constant, the solution is particularly simple, <math>y = A e^{-\\alpha t}</math> and describes, e.g., if <math>\\alpha>0</math>, the exponential decay of radioactive material at the macroscopic level. If the value of <math>\\alpha</math> is not known a priori, it can be determined from two measurements of the solution. For example,\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dt} + \\alpha y = 0, y(1)=2, y(2)=1</math>\n\ngives <math>\\alpha = ln(2)</math> and <math>y = 4 e^{-ln(2) t}= 2^{2-t}</math>.\n\n==Non-separable (non-homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations==\nFirst-order linear non-homogeneous ODEs (ordinary [[differential equation]]s) are not separable. They can be solved by the following approach, known as an ''[[integrating factor]]'' method. Consider first-order linear ODEs of the general form:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)</math>\n\nThe method for solving this equation relies on a special integrating factor, ''&mu;'':\n\n:<math>\\mu = e^{\\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\\, dt}</math>\n\nWe choose this integrating factor because it has the special property that its derivative is itself times the function we are integrating, that is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d{\\mu}}{dx} = e^{\\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\\, dt} \\cdot p(x) = \\mu p(x)</math>\n\nMultiply both sides of the original differential equation by ''&mu;'' to get:\n\n:<math>\\mu{\\frac{dy}{dx}} + \\mu{p(x)y}  = \\mu{q(x)}</math>\n\nBecause of the special ''&mu;'' we picked, we may substitute ''d&mu;''/''dx'' for ''&mu;''&nbsp;''p''(''x''), simplifying the equation to:\n\n:<math>\\mu{\\frac{dy}{dx}} + y{\\frac{d{\\mu}}{dx}} = \\mu{q(x)}</math>\n\nUsing the [[product rule (calculus)|product rule]] in reverse, we get:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}{(\\mu{y})} = \\mu{q(x)}</math>\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n:<math>\\mu{y} = \\left(\\int\\mu q(x)\\, dx\\right) + C</math>\n\nFinally, to solve for ''y'' we divide both sides by <math>\\mu</math>:\n\n:<math>y = \\frac{\\left(\\int\\mu q(x)\\, dx\\right) + C}{\\mu}</math>\n\nSince ''&mu;'' is a function of ''x'', we cannot simplify any further directly.\n\n==Second-order linear ordinary differential equations==\n\n===A simple example===\nSuppose a mass is attached to a spring which exerts an attractive force on the mass [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the extension/compression of the spring. For now, we may ignore any other forces ([[gravity]], [[friction]], etc.).  We shall write the extension of the spring at a time ''t'' as&nbsp;''x''(''t'').  Now, using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] we can write (using convenient units):\n\n: <math>m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +kx=0,</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is the mass and ''k'' is the spring constant that represents a measure of spring stiffness. For simplicity's sake, let us take ''m=k'' as an example.\n\nIf we look for solutions that have the form <math>Ce^{\\lambda t}</math>, where ''C'' is a constant, we discover the relationship <math>\\lambda^2+1=0</math>, and thus <math>\\lambda</math> must be one of the [[complex number]]s <math>i</math> or <math>-i</math>.  Thus, using [[Euler's theorem]] we can say that the solution must be of the form:\n\n: <math>x(t) = A \\cos t + B \\sin t</math>\n\nSee a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x solution] by [[WolframAlpha]].\n\nTo determine the unknown constants ''A'' and ''B'',  we need ''initial conditions'', i.e. equalities that specify the state of the system at a given time (usually&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nFor example, if we suppose at ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 the extension is a unit distance (''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and the particle is not moving (''dx''/''dt''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0). We have\n\n: <math>x(0) = A \\cos 0 + B \\sin 0 = A = 1, </math>\n\nand so&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\n: <math>x'(0) = -A \\sin 0 + B \\cos 0 = B = 0, </math>\n\nand so ''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nTherefore ''x''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;cos&nbsp;''t''.  This is an example of [[simple harmonic motion]].\n\nSee a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x%2Cx%280%29%3D1%2Cx%27%280%29%3D0 solution] by [[Wolfram Alpha]].\n\n===A more complicated model===\nThe above model of an oscillating mass on a spring is plausible but not very realistic: in practice, [[friction]] will tend to decelerate the mass and have magnitude proportional to its velocity (i.e.&nbsp;''dx''/''dt'').  Our new differential equation, expressing the balancing of the acceleration and the forces, is\n\n: <math>m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c \\frac{dx}{dt} + kx=0,</math>\n\nwhere <math>c</math> is the damping coefficient representing  friction.  Again looking for solutions of the form <math>Ce^{\\lambda t}</math>, we find that\n\n: <math>m\\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0. </math>\n\nThis is a [[quadratic equation]] which we can solve.  If <math>c^2<4km</math> there are two complex conjugate  roots ''a''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;''ib'', and the solution (with the above boundary conditions) will look like this:\n\n: <math>x(t) = e^{at} \\left(\\cos bt - \\frac{a}{b} \\sin bt \\right) </math>\n\nLet us for simplicity take <math>m=1</math>, then <math>0<c=-2a</math> and <math>k=a^2+b^2</math>.\n\nThe equation can be also solved in MATLAB symbolic toolbox as\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nx = dsolve('D2x+c*Dx+k*x=0','x(0)=1','Dx(0)=0')\n</source>\nalthough the solution looks rather ugly,\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nx = (c + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)) - \n    (c - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))\n</source>\n\nThis is a model of a [[Damping|damped oscillator]]. The plot of displacement against time would look like this:\n\n: [[Image:Damped Oscillation2.svg|400px|center]]\n\nwhich resembles how one would expect a vibrating spring to behave as friction removes energy from the system.\n\n==Linear systems of ODEs==\n\nThe following example of a first order linear systems of ODEs\n: <math> y_1'=y_1+2y_2+t</math>\n: <math> y_2'=2y_1-2y_2+\\sin(t)</math>\n\ncan be easily solved symbolically using [[List_of_numerical_analysis_software|numerical analysis software]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Closed and exact differential forms]]\n* [[Ordinary differential equation]]\n* [[Bernoulli differential equation]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* A.

During [[World War II]], he was a [[General of the Army (United States)|five-star general]] in the [[United States Army]] and served as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander]] of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Allied Expeditionary Forces]] in Europe. He was responsible for planning and supervising the invasion of [[North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]] in 1942\u201343 and the successful [[Invasion of Normandy|invasion of France]] and [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Germany]] in 1944\u201345 from the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nBorn '''David Dwight Eisenhower''' <!--Do not remove.

His mother was born a [[Lutheran]], married as a [[River Brethren]], and later became a [[Jehovah's Witness]]. Even so, Eisenhower did not belong to any organized church until 1952. He cited constant relocation during his military career as one reason.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/subject_guides/pdf/Eisenhower_Religion.pdf |title=Study guide on Eisenhower and religion |publisher=Eisenhower Presidential Library |access-date=August 16, 2017 |page=1 }}</ref> He graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1915 and later married [[Mamie Eisenhower|Mamie Doud]], with whom he had two sons. During [[World War I]], he was denied a request to serve in Europe and instead commanded a unit that trained tank crews. Following the war, he served under various generals and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1941. After the U.S. entered World War II, Eisenhower oversaw the successful invasions of North Africa and [[Sicily]] before supervising the invasions of France and Germany. After the war, Eisenhower served as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] and then took on the role as president of [[Columbia University]]. In 1951\u201352, he served as the first [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe|Supreme Commander of NATO]].\n\nIn 1952, Eisenhower entered the [[United States presidential election, 1952|presidential race]] as a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] to block the isolationist foreign policies of Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], who opposed NATO and wanted no foreign entanglements. He won that election and the 1956 election in landslides, both times defeating [[Adlai Stevenson II]]. He became the first Republican to win since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928. Eisenhower's main goals in office were to contain the expansion of the [[Soviet Union]] and reduce federal deficits. In 1953, he threatened the use of nuclear weapons until China agreed to peace terms in the [[Korean War]].  China did agree and an armistice resulted that remains in effect.  His [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy of [[nuclear deterrence]] prioritized inexpensive [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|nuclear weapons]] while reducing funding for expensive Army divisions. He continued [[Harry S. Truman]]'s policy of recognizing the [[Republic of China]] as the legitimate government of China, and he won congressional approval of the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]].

His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in [[Vichy France]] and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders were \"thunderstruck\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by [[Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle]]. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter.<ref>Atkinson, ''An Army at Dawn'', pp. 251\u20132.</ref> Eisenhower later appointed, as High Commissioner, General [[Henri Giraud]], who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=204\u201310}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franklin_D._Roosevelt,_General_Eisenhower,_and_General_Patton_in_Castelvetrano,_Sicily_-_NARA_-_196611.jpg|thumb|left|General Eisenhower, General [[George S.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] in [[Sicily]], 1943]]\n\nOperation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower's combat command skills; during the initial phase of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]'s move into the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass|Kasserine Pass]], Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates. He also was initially indecisive in his removal of [[Lloyd Fredendall]], commanding [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]]. He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns.<ref>Ambrose (1983), pp.&nbsp;230\u20133.</ref> In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]]. The Eighth Army had [[Western Desert Campaign|advanced across the Western Desert]] from the east and was ready for the start of the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. Eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of ETOUSA to become commander of NATOUSA.\n\nAfter the capitulation of [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces in North Africa, Eisenhower oversaw the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]]. Once [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], the Italian leader, had fallen in Italy, the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]. But while Eisenhower argued with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians, the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country. The Germans made the already tough battle more difficult by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=254\u20135}}</ref>\n\n=== Supreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord ===\nIn December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower&nbsp;\u2013 not Marshall&nbsp;\u2013 would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=275\u20136}}</ref> He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied [[Normandy landings|assault on the coast of Normandy]] in June 1944 under the code name [[Operation Overlord]], the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany.\n\n[[File:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower speaks with men of the [[502nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[101st Airborne Division]], on June 5, 1944, the day before the [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] invasion.]]\n\nEisenhower, as well as the officers and troops under him, had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations, and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans\u2014a beach landing assault. His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=280\u20131}}</ref> Admiral [[Ernest J.

Two months later (August 15), the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of Southern France]] took place, and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. Many thought that victory in Europe would come by summer's end, but the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year. From then until the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] on May 8, 1945, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded all Allied forces, and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] north of the [[Alps]]. He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families. This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|p=278}}</ref> Eisenhower's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed. It has been called one of the great speeches of history:\n<blockquote>Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.<ref>William Safire, ''Lend me your ears: great speeches in history'' (2004) p. 1143</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Liberation of France and victory in Europe ===\n[[File:Allied Commanders after Germany Surrendered.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower with Allied commanders following the signing of the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] at Reims]]\n\nOnce the coastal assault had succeeded, Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy, and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany. Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his [[21st Army Group]]'s attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley ([[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th U.S. Army Group]]) and Devers ([[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth U.S. Army Group]]) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, [[Battle of the Scheldt|opened in late 1944]], and victory became a more distinct probability.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=340\u201354}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower as General of the Army crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Eisenhower as General of the Army, 1945]]\n\nIn recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], equivalent to the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He interacted adeptly with allies such as [[Winston Churchill]], Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] and General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He dealt with Soviet [[Georgy Zhukov|Marshal Zhukov]], his Russian counterpart, and they became good friends.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''Eisenhower in War and Peace'' (2012) p. 451.</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, The Germans launched a surprise counter offensive, the [[Battle of the Bulge]], which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Air Force to engage.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=375\u201380}}</ref> German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the Soviets and the western front with the Allies. The British wanted to capture Berlin, but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin, and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit. The British backed down, but then wanted Eisenhower to move into [[Czechoslovakia]] for political reasons. Washington refused to support Churchill's plan to use Eisenhower's army for political maneuvers against Moscow. The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon. The Soviet [[Red Army]] captured Berlin in a [[Battle of Berlin|very large-scale bloody battle]], and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7, 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=395\u2013406}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Eisenhower anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize Nazi crimes as propaganda ([[Holocaust denial]]) and took steps against it by demanding extensive still and movie photographic documentation of Nazi death camps.<ref>{{harvnb|Hobbs|1999|p=223}}</ref>\n\n== After World War II ==\n\n=== Military Governor in Germany and Army Chief of Staff ===\n[[File:American Sector Germany.png|thumb|General Eisenhower served as military governor of the American zone (highlighted) in [[Allied-occupied Germany]] from May through November 1945]]\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the [[American occupation zone]], located primarily in [[Southern Germany]], and [[Office of Military Government, United States|headquartered]] at the [[IG Farben Building]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]].

His main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the [[atomic bomb]] and relations with the Soviets, [[Harry S.

Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.

Believing that a general should not participate in politics, one author later wrote that \"figuratively speaking, [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\". As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions. In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the [[Potsdam Conference]] that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election,<ref name=\"pusey1956\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/eisenhowerthepre002645mbp#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Eisenhower, the President | publisher=Macmillan | author=Pusey, Merlo J. | year=1956 | pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination.<ref name=\"nyt20030711\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/11/us/truman-wrote-of-48-offer-to-eisenhower.html?fta=y Truman Wrote of '48 Offer to Eisenhower]\" ''The New York Times'', July 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nAs the election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming [[1948 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was \"not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office\"; \"life-long professional soldiers\", he wrote, \"in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office\".{{r|pusey1956}} Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time.

Dewey]] was considered the probable winner and would presumably serve two terms, meaning that Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would be too old to have another chance to run.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=455\u201360}}</ref>\n\n=== President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14059-0018, Berlin, Oberbefehlshaber der vier Verb\u00fcndeten.jpg|thumb|The Supreme Commanders of the [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]] on June 5, 1945, in Berlin: [[Bernard Montgomery]], Dwight D.

Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} by the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]] that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000.<ref>Pietrusza, David, 1948: Harry Truman's Victory and the Year That Transformed America, Union Square Punlishing, 2011, p. 201</ref>\n\nEisenhower's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the [[Marshall Plan]], and [[The American Assembly]], Eisenhower's \"vision of a great cultural center where business, professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature\". His biographer [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]] suggested that this period served as \"the political education of General Eisenhower\", since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational, administrative, and financial demands for the university. Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations, he also gained exposure to economic analysis, which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy. \"Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings,\" one Aid to Europe member claimed.\n\nEisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote \"the American form of democracy\" through education. He was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee. He informed them that his main purpose was \"to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy\". As a result, he was \"almost incessantly\" devoted to the idea of the American Assembly, a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950.\n\nWithin months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university, Eisenhower was requested to advise [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[James Forrestal]] on the unification of the armed services. About six months after his appointment, he became the informal [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in Washington. Two months later he fell ill, and he spent over a month in recovery at the [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. He returned to his post in [[New York City|New York]] in mid-May, and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state. Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape, he traveled around the country during mid-to-late 1950, building financial support from Columbia Associates, an alumni association.\n\nEisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia University faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests. As a career military man, he naturally had little in common with the academics.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=479\u201383}}</ref>\n\nThe contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency. Meanwhile, Columbia University's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president's ties to oilmen and businessmen, including Leonard McCollum, the president of [[Continental Oil]]; Frank Abrams, the chairman of [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]]; Bob Kleberg, the president of the King Ranch; H. J. Porter, a Texas oil executive; Bob Woodruff, the president of the [[Coca-Cola Corporation]]; and Clarence Francis, the chairman of [[General Foods]].\n\nAs the president of Columbia, Eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy. His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership. His biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years.<ref>Warshaw, Shirley Anne (1993). ''Reexamining the Eisenhower presidency'', Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0313287929}}</ref>\n\nThe trustees of Columbia University refused to accept Eisenhower's resignation in December 1950, when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe. Eisenhower retired from active service as an army general on May 31, 1952, and he resumed his presidency of Columbia. He held this position until January 20, 1953, when he became the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President of the United States]].\n\nNATO did not have strong bipartisan support in Congress at the time that Eisenhower assumed its military command. Eisenhower advised the participating European nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the NATO force before such would come from the war-weary United States.\n\nAt home, Eisenhower was more effective in making the case for NATO in Congress than the Truman administration had been. By the middle of 1951, with American and European support, NATO was a genuine military power. Nevertheless, Eisenhower thought that NATO would become a truly European alliance, with the American and Canadian commitments ending after about ten years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=502\u201311}}</ref>\n\n=== Presidential campaign of 1952 ===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1952}}\n[[File:I Like Ike button, 1952.png|thumb|upright|Button from the 1952 campaign]]\nPresident Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and declared himself and his family to be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|p=512}}</ref> A \"[[Draft Eisenhower]]\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]] to counter the candidacy of [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|pp=524\u20138}}</ref> Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \"[[I Like Ike]]\".

Nixon]] as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose.

The campaign strategy, dubbed \"K<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>\", was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues: Korea, Communism and corruption. In an effort to accommodate the right, he stressed that the liberation of Eastern Europe should be by peaceful means only; he also distanced himself from his former boss President Truman.\n\nTwo controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff, but did not affect the campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Nixon [[Checkers speech|spoke out adroitly]] to avoid potential damage, but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on Eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of [[Joseph McCarthy]] on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance.<ref>Ambrose (1983). ''Eisenhower'', pp. 556\u201367.</ref> Just two weeks prior to the election, Eisenhower vowed to go to Korea and end the war there. He promised to maintain a strong commitment against Communism while avoiding the topic of NATO; finally, he stressed a corruption-free, frugal administration at home.\n\n[[File:Eisenhower_on_Hobo_Day.jpg|right|thumb|Presidential candidate Eisenhower in the [[Hobo Day|Hobo Day parade]] at [[South Dakota State University]] in 1952]]\nHe defeated Democratic candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in a landslide, with an electoral margin of 442 to 89, marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years.<ref name=\"time 2008\" /> In the election he also brought with him a Republican majority in the House (by eight votes) and in the Senate (actually a tie, with Nixon providing the majority vote).<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1983|p=571}}</ref>\n\nEisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century, and at age 62, was the oldest man elected President since [[James Buchanan]] in 1856 (President Truman stood at 64 in 1948 as the incumbent president, having succeeded to the Presidency in 1945 upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt).<ref name=\"'70s\">{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0465041957|page=7}}</ref> Eisenhower was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century and was the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency until [[Donald Trump]], who never held public office nor served in the military; the other Presidents who did not have prior elected office were [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S.

Eisenhower, the popular incumbent, successfully ran for re-election. The election was a re-match of 1952, as his opponent in 1956 was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier. Compared to the 1952 election, Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, while losing Missouri. His voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record. Instead what stood out this time, \"was the response to personal qualities\u2014 to his sincerity, his integrity and sense of duty, his virtue as a family man, his religious devotion, and his sheer likeableness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Angus Campbell|author2=Philip L.

Eisenhower was among those who blamed the Old Guard for the losses, and he took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP. Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate, progressive Republican: \"I have just one purpose&nbsp;... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country.

B3.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the [[Cold War]] escalated during his presidency. When the Soviet Union [[RDS-37|successfully tested a hydrogen bomb]] in late November 1955, Eisenhower, against the advice of Dulles, decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the Soviets. In an attempt to make their refusal more difficult, he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses, such as power generation. This approach was labeled \"[[Atoms for Peace]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|pp=132\u20134, 147}}</ref>\n\nThe U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it, due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. Indeed, Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons, while reducing conventional forces, and with them the overall defense budget, a policy formulated as a result of [[Project Solarium]] and expressed in [[NSC 162/2]]. This approach became known as the \"[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]\", and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=144}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955 American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament. The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections. In talks located in London that year, they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower, when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections. In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria, and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S., U.K. and France.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=247}}</ref> At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called \"Open Skies\" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure.

Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] assisted the President greatly in working with the Old Guard, and was sorely missed when his death (in July 1953) left Eisenhower with his successor [[William Knowland]], whom Eisenhower disliked.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=118}}</ref>\n\nThis prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy's highly criticized methods against communism. To facilitate relations with Congress, Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the White House. This position drew criticism from a number of corners.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|pp=56\u201362}}</ref> In late 1953, McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the [[United States Senate elections, 1954|1954 Senate elections]]. Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=140}}</ref>\n\nAmong Eisenhower's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) into McCarthy's witch hunt for communists, which would interfere with, and perhaps delay, the AEC's important work on [[H-bomb]]s. The administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the AEC, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], had urged that the H-bomb work be delayed. Eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance, though he knew this would create fertile ground for McCarthy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=167}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1955, McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel. Eisenhower was furious, and issued an order as follows: \"It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters&nbsp;... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed.\" This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting, and soon became a tradition known as [[executive privilege]]. Ike's denial of McCarthy's access to his staff reduced McCarthy's hearings to rants about trivial matters, and contributed to his ultimate downfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|pp=188\u20139}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1954, the Old Guard put forward a constitutional amendment, called the [[Bricker Amendment]], which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive, such as the [[Yalta Agreement]]s. Eisenhower opposed the measure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=154}}</ref> The Old Guard agreed with Eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises, which the Democrats opposed. The President succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the AEC.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=157}}</ref>\n\nThe Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election.<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|1984|p=219}}</ref> Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (later U.S. president) in the Senate and Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] in the House, both from Texas. [[Joseph W. Martin Jr.|Joe Martin]], the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955, wrote that Eisenhower \"never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill. There were exceptions, [[Leonard W. Hall]], for example, who as chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] tried to open the administration's eyes to the political facts of life, with occasional success. However, these exceptions were not enough to right the balance.\"<ref name=martin>Joseph W. Martin as told to Donavan, Robert J. (1960), ''My First Fifty Years in Politics'', New York: McGraw Hill, p. 227</ref>\n\nSpeaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress, with results, \"often the reverse of what he has desired\" because Members of Congress, \"resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this'.

Truman as the incumbent was not covered. Eisenhower became the first U.S. president constitutionally prevented from running for re-election to a third term.\n\nEisenhower was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of the [[Former Presidents Act]]; two living former Presidents, [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Harry S.

Under the act, Eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] detail.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/former-presidents.html|title=Former Presidents Act|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960 election to choose his successor, Eisenhower endorsed Nixon over Democrat [[John F.

He told friends, \"I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy.\"<ref name=\"time 2008\" /> He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days, although he may have done Nixon some harm. When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted, Eisenhower joked, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one. I don't remember.\" Kennedy's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials. Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy. Eisenhower, who was the oldest president in history at that time (then 70), was succeeded by the youngest elected president, as Kennedy was 43.<ref name=\"time 2008\" />\n\nIt was originally intended for President Eisenhower to have a more active role in the campaign as he wanted to respond to attacks Kennedy made on his administration. However, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower expressed concern to Second Lady Pat Nixon about the strain campaigning would put on his heart and wanted the President to back out of it without letting him know of her intervention. Vice President Nixon himself also received concern from White House physician Major General Howard Snyder, who informed him that he could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for the President and his health had been exacerbated by Kennedy's attacks. Nixon then convinced Eisenhower not to go ahead with the expanded campaign schedule and limit himself to the original schedule. Nixon reflected that if Eisenhower had carried out his expanded campaign schedule he might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election, especially in states that Kennedy won with razor-thin margins.

During his presidency, he was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring, golf-playing president. This was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor, [[John F. Kennedy]], who was 26 years his junior. Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at [[Little Rock Central High School|Central High School]] in Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the [[civil rights]] movement to the degree that activists wanted.

He did, after all, end the Korean War without getting into any others. He stabilized, and did not escalate, the Soviet\u2013American rivalry. He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism. He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism. He maintained prosperity, balanced the budget, promoted technological innovation, facilitated (if reluctantly) the civil rights movement and warned, in the most memorable farewell address since Washington's, of a \"military\u2013industrial complex\" that could endanger the nation's liberties. Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do.<ref>John Lewis Gaddis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/eisenhower-in-war-and-peace-by-jean-edward-smith.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all \"He Made It Look Easy: 'Eisenhower in War and Peace', by Jean Edward Smith\"], ''New York Times Book Review'', April 20, 2012.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:72-901-1 HR7786 Veterans Day June 1 1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Eisenhower signs the legislation that changes [[Armistice Day]] to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], June 1, 1954]]\n[[File:Meeting with President Eisenhower.

Initially, [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] tried to operate without a chief of staff, but each eventually appointed one.\n\nAs president, Eisenhower also initiated the \"[[up or out]]\" policy that still prevails in the U.S. military, whereby officers who are passed over for promotion twice are usually honorably but quickly discharged to make way for younger, more able officers.

Dejima was built to constrain foreign traders. Originally built to house [[Nanban trade|Portuguese traders]], it was used by the Dutch as a [[trading post]] from 1641 until 1853. Covering an area of {{convert|120|\u00d7|75|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|9000|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, it was later integrated into the city through the process of [[land reclamation]]. In 1922, the \"Dejima Dutch Trading Post\" was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|Japanese national historic site]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1543, the history of direct contacts between Japan and Europe began with the arrival of storm-blown [[Portugal|Portuguese]] merchants on [[Tanegashima]]. Six years later the Jesuit missionary [[Francis Xavier]] landed in [[Kagoshima]]. At first Portuguese traders were based in [[Hirado]], but they moved in search of a better port. In 1570 ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' [[\u014cmura Sumitada]] converted to Catholicism (choosing Bartolomeu as his Christian name) and made a deal with the Portuguese to develop Nagasaki; soon the port was open for trade. In 1580 Sumitada gave the jurisdiction of Nagasaki to the Jesuits, and the Portuguese obtained the ''[[de facto]]'' [[monopoly]] on the silk trade with China through [[Colonial Macau|Macau]].\n\nThe ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Iemitsu|Iemitsu]] ordered the construction of the artificial island in 1634, to accommodate the Portuguese traders living in Nagasaki and prevent the propagation of their religion. This was one of the many edicts put forth by Iemitsu between 1633 and 1639 moderating contact between Japan and other countries. However, in response to the [[Shimabara Rebellion|uprising]] of the predominantly Christian population in the [[Shimabara, Nagasaki|Shimabara]]-[[Amakusa Islands|Amakusa]] region, the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] government decided to expel the Portuguese in 1639.\n\nSince 1609, the [[Dutch East India Company]] had run a trading post on the island of Hirado. The departure of the Portuguese left the Dutch employees of the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' (''VOC'') as the sole Westerners with trade access to Japan. For 33 years they were allowed to trade relatively freely.  At its maximum the Hirado trading post covered a large area.{{Quantify|date=August 2010}}<ref>Edo-Tokyo Museum exhibition catalog. (2000). ''A Very Unique Collection of Historical Significance: The Kapitan (the Dutch Chief) Collection from the Edo Period &ndash; The Dutch Fascination with Japan'', p. 206.</ref>\nIn 1637 and 1639 stone warehouses were constructed within the ambit of this Hirado trading post. Christian-era year dates were used on the stonework of the new warehouses and these were used in 1640 as a pretext to demolish the buildings and relocate the trading post to Nagasaki.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}\n\nWith the expulsion of the last Portuguese in 1639, Dejima became a failed commercial post and without the annual trading with Portuguese ships from Macau, the economy of Nagasaki suffered greatly. The Dutch were forced by government officials to move from Hirado to Dejima in Nagasaki.<ref name=\"ETM207\">Edo-Tokyo Museum exhibition catalog, p. 207.</ref> From 1641 on, only Chinese and Dutch ships were allowed to come to Japan, and Nagasaki harbor was the only harbor they were allowed to enter.\n\n==Organization==\nOn the administrative level, the island of Dejima was part of the city of Nagasaki. The 25 local Japanese families who owned the land received an annual rent from the Dutch. Dejima was a small island, {{convert|120|m}} by {{convert|75|m}},<ref>Ken Vos - The article \"Dejima als venster en doorgeefluik\" in the catalogue (Brussels, 5 October 1989 - 16 December 1989) of the exhibition Europalia 1989: \"Oranda : De Nederlanden in Japan (1600-1868)\"</ref> linked to the mainland by a small bridge, guarded on both sides, and with a gate on the Dutch side. It contained houses for about twenty Dutchmen, warehouses, and accommodation for Japanese officials. The Dutch were watched by a number of Japanese officials, gatekeepers, night watchmen, and a supervisor (''otona'' \u4e59\u540d) with about fifty subordinates. Numerous merchants supplied goods and catering, and about 150 interpreters (''ts\u016bji'' \u901a\u8a5e) served. They all had to be paid by the ''VOC''. Like the city of Nagasaki, Dejima was under the direct supervision of Edo through a governor (''[[Nagasaki bugy\u014d]]'').\n\nEvery ship that arrived in Dejima was inspected.  Its sails were held by the Japanese until they released the ship to leave. They confiscated religious books and weapons. The Dutch were not allowed to hold any religious services on the island.\n\nDespite the financial burden of maintaining the isolated outpost on Dejima, the trade with Japan was very profitable for the Dutch, initially yielding profits of 50% or more. Trade declined in the 18th century, as only two ships per year were allowed to dock at Dejima. After the bankruptcy of the East-India Company in 1795, the Dutch government took over exchange with Japan. Times were especially hard when the Netherlands (then called the [[Batavian Republic]]) was under [[First French Empire|French Napoleonic rule]].  All ties with the homeland were severed at Dejima, and for a while, it was the only place in the world where the Dutch flag was flown.\n\nThe chief Dutch official in Japan was called the ''[[Opperhoofd]]'' by the Dutch, or ''Kapitan'' (from Portuguese ''capit\u00e3o'') by the Japanese. This descriptive title did not change when the island's trading fell under Dutch state authority. Throughout these years, the plan was to have one incumbent per year&mdash;but sometimes plans needed to be flexible.\n\n==Trade==\nOriginally, the Dutch mainly traded in [[silk]], cotton, and ''materia medica'' from China and India, but sugar became more important later. Also, [[deer]] [[Fur clothing|pelts]] and [[Shagreen|shark skin]] were transported to Japan from [[Taiwan]], as well as books, scientific instruments and many other rarities from Europe. In return, the Dutch traders bought Japanese copper, silver, camphor, porcelain, lacquer ware and rice.\n\nTo this was added the personal trade of VOC employees on Dejima, which was an important source of income for them and their Japanese counterparts. They sold more than 10,000 foreign books on various scientific subjects to the Japanese from the end of the 18th to the early 19th century.  These became the basis of knowledge and a factor in the ''[[Rangaku]]'' movement, or Dutch studies.\n\n==Ships==\nIn all, 606 Dutch ships arrived at Dejima during its two centuries of settlement, from 1641 to 1847.\n* The first period, from 1641 to 1671, was rather free, and saw an average of 7 Dutch ships every year (12 sank during this period).\n* From 1671 to 1715, about 5 Dutch ships were allowed to visit Dejima every year.\n* From 1715, only 2 ships were permitted every year, which was reduced to 1 ship in 1790, and again increased to 2 ships in 1799.\n* During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), in which the Netherlands was occupied by (and a satellite of) France, Dutch ships could not safely reach Japan in the face of British opposition.  They relied on \"neutral\" American and Danish ships.  The Netherlands was [[Annexation|annexed]] as part of France (1810\u20131813), while Britain conquered Dutch colonial possessions and after the [[invasion of Java (1811)]], Dejima was the only place in the world where the free Dutch flag still flew, as ordered by commissioner [[Hendrik Doeff]].\n* In 1815 the [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies|Dutch East Indies]] was returned to the control of the Netherlands and regular Dutch trading traffic was reestablished.\n\n== Trade policy ==\nFor two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.  The Japanese were likewise banned from entering Dejima, except interpreters, cooks, carpenters, clerks and 'Women of Pleasure' from the Maruyama teahouses. These ''[[Prostitution in Japan|y\u016bjo]]'' were handpicked from 1642 by the Japanese, often against their will. From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]'s doctrine of promoting European practical sciences. A few ''Oranda-yuki'' (\"those who stay with the Dutch\") were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post. Once a year the Europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the Suwa-Shrine under escort. Sometimes physicians such as [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], and [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] were called to high-ranking Japanese patients with the permission of the authorities.<ref>''In the context of Commodore Perry's \"opening\" of Japan in 1853, American naval expedition planners incorporated reference material written by men whose published accounts of Japan were based on first-hand experience. J. W. Spaulding brought with him books by Japanologists [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], and [[Isaac Titsingh]].'' Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779\u20131822'', p. 73.</ref>  Starting in the 18th century, Dejima became known throughout Japan as a center of medicine, military science, and astronomy.  Many [[samurai]] traveled there for \"Dutch studies\" ([[Rangaku]]).\n\nIn addition, the ''Opperhoofd'' was treated like the representative of a tributary state, which meant that he had to pay a visit of [[Dutch missions to Edo|homage]] to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in [[Edo]]. The Dutch delegation traveled to Edo yearly between 1660 and 1790, and once every four years thereafter. This prerogative was denied to the Chinese traders. The lengthy travel to the shogunal court broke the boredom of the Dutch stay, but it was a costly affair. Government officials told them in advance and in detail which (expensive) gifts were expected at the court, such as [[astrolabe]]s, a pair of glasses, telescopes, globes, medical instruments, medical books, or exotic animals and tropical birds. In return, the Dutch delegation received some gifts from the ''sh\u014dgun''. On arrival in Edo, the ''Opperhoofd'' and his retinue (usually his scribe and the factory physician) had to wait in the ''Nagasakiya'' ([[:ja:\u9577\u5d0e\u5c4b\u6e90\u53f3\u885b\u9580|\u9577\u5d0e\u5c4b]]), their mandatory residence, until they were summoned at the court. During the reign of the somewhat eccentric ''sh\u014dgun'' Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, they were expected to perform Dutch dances and songs for the amusement of the ''sh\u014dgun'' after their official audience, according to [[Engelbert Kaempfer]].  But they also used the opportunity of their stay of about two to three weeks in the capital to exchange knowledge with learned Japanese and, under escort, to visit the town.\n\n==New introductions to Japan==\n\n[[File:DejimaBadminton.jpg|thumb|Scene of badminton playing in Dejima, c. 18th century]]\n[[File:DejimaBillard.jpg|thumb|Dutch playing billiards in Dejima, c. 19th century]]\n*[[Photography]], first lessons in photography given to Japanese in 1856 by the physician of the island, dr. J. K. van den Broek.\n*[[Badminton]], a sport that originated in India, was introduced by the Dutch during the 18th century; it is mentioned in the ''Sayings of the Dutch''.\n*[[Glossary of cue sports terms#billiard|Billiard]]s were introduced in Japan on Dejima in 1764; it is noted as \"Ball striking table\" (\u7389\u7a81\u306e\u5834) in the paintings of Kawahara Keika (\u5ddd\u539f\u6176\u8cc0).\n*[[Beer]] seems to have been introduced as imports during the period of isolation. The Dutch governor [[Hendrik Doeff|Doeff]] made his own beer in Nagasaki, following the disruption of trade during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Local production of beer started in Japan in 1880.\n*[[Clover]] was introduced in Japan by the Dutch as packing material for fragile cargo. The Japanese called it \"White packing herb\" (\u30b7\u30ed\u30c4\u30e1\u30af\u30b5), in reference to its white flowers.\n*[[Coffee]] was introduced in Japan by the Dutch under the name ''Moka'' and ''koffie''. The latter name appears in 18th-century Japanese books. Siebold refers to Japanese coffee amateurs in Nagasaki around 1823.\n*Japan's oldest [[piano]] was introduced by Siebold in 1823, and later given to a tradesperson in the name of Kumaya (\u718a\u8c37). The piano is today on display in the [[Kumaya Art Museum]] (\u718a\u8c37\u7f8e\u8853\u9928), [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi City]].\n*[[Paint]] (Tar), used for ships, was introduced by the Dutch. The original Dutch name (''pek'') was also adopted in Japanese (Penki/\u30da\u30f3\u30ad).\n*[[Cabbage]] and [[tomato]]es were introduced in the 17th century by the Dutch.\n*[[Chocolate]] was introduced between 1789 and 1801; it is mentioned as a drink in the pleasure houses of Maruyama.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Nagasaki Naval Training Center==\n[[File:NagasakiNavalTrainingCenter.jpg|thumb|right|The Nagasaki Training Center, in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], next to Dejima (in the background).]]\n\nFollowing the forced opening of Japan by US Navy [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Perry]] in 1854, the [[Bakufu]] suddenly increased its interactions with Dejima in an effort to build up knowledge of Western shipping methods. The {{Nihongo|[[Nagasaki Naval Training Center]]|\u9577\u5d0e\u6d77\u8ecd\u4f1d\u7fd2\u6240|Nagasaki Kaigun Densh\u016bsho}}, a naval training institute, was established in 1855 by the government of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' at the entrance of Dejima, to enable maximum interaction with Dutch naval know-how. The center was  equipped with Japan's first steamship, the ''[[Kank\u014d Maru]]'', given by the government of the Netherlands the same year. The future Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] was one of the students of the Training Center.\n\n==Reconstruction==\n[[File:C1870`s Nagasaki Dejima Island.png|thumb|left|View of Dejima Island ca.1870]]\nThe Dutch East India Company's trading post at Dejima was abolished when Japan concluded the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]] with the USA in 1858. This ended Dejima's role as Japan's only window on the Western world during the era of national isolation. Since then, the island was expanded by [[reclaimed land]] and merged into Nagasaki. Extensive redesigning of Nagasaki Harbor in 1904 obscured its original location.<ref name=\"ETM47\">Edo-Tokyo Museum exhibition catalog, p. 47.</ref>  The original footprint of Dejima Island has been marked by rivets; but as restoration progresses, the [[wikt:ambit|ambit]] of the island will be easier to see at a glance.\n[[File:Edo-era Dejima within modern Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|Edo-era boundaries of Dejima island (outlined in red) within the modern city of Nagasaki.]]\n\nDejima today is a work in progress. The island was designated a national historical site in 1922, but further steps were slow to follow. Restoration work was started in 1953, but that project languished.<ref name=\"ETM47\"/>  In 1996, restoration of Dejima began with plans for reconstructing 25 buildings in their early 19th-century state. To better display Dejima's fan-shaped form, the project anticipated rebuilding only parts of the surrounding embankment wall that had once enclosed the island. Buildings that remained from the [[Meiji period]] were to be used.\n\nIn 2000, five buildings including the Deputy Factor's Quarters were completed and opened to the public.  In the spring of 2006, the finishing touches were put on the Chief Factor's Residence, the Japanese Officials' Office, the Head Clerk's Quarters, the No. 3 Warehouse, and the Sea Gate. Currently some 10 buildings throughout the area have been restored.\n\nIn 2017, six new buildings as well as the 'Omotemon-bashi Bridge' (the old bridge to the mainland) were restored. The bridge was officially opened in attendance of members of the Japanese and Dutch royal families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hollandkyushu.com/en/project/opening-ceremony-omotemon-bashi-bridge/|title=Opening ceremony Omotemon-bashi Bridge|website=hollandkyushu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}</ref> \n\nThe long-term planning intends that Dejima will be surrounded by water on all four sides; its characteristic fan-shaped form and all of its embankment walls will be fully restored.

The Japanese used to call the trading post chiefs ''kapitan'' which is derived from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''capit\u00e3o'' (cf. Latin ''caput'', head). In its historical usage, the word is a [[gubernatorial]] title, comparable to the English [[Chief factor]], for the chief executive officer of a Dutch ''factory'' in the sense of trading post, as led by a Factor, i.e. agent.\n\n===Notable ''opperhoofden'' at Hirado===\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Caron]]: 3.2.1639 - 13.2.1641 [''Caron was last ''Opperhoofd'' at Hirado.'']\n\n===Notable ''opperhoofden'' at Dejima===\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Caron]]: 3.2.1639 - 13.2.1641 [''Caron was the first ''Opperhoofd'' in Dejima following the forced move from Hirado.'']\n*[[Zacharias Wagenaer]] [Wagener]: 1.11.1656 - 27.10.1657\n*[[Zacharias Wagenaer]] [Wagener]: 22.10.1658 - 4.11.1659\n*[[Andreas Cleyer]] [Andries]: 20.10.1682 - 8.11.1683\n*[[Andreas Cleyer]]: 17.10.1685 - 5.11.1686\n*[[Hendrik Godfried Duurkoop]]: 23.11.1776 - 11.11.1777\n*[[Isaac Titsingh]]: 29.11.1779 - 5.11.1780\n*[[Isaac Titsingh]]: 24.11.1781 - 26.10.1783\n*[[Isaac Titsingh]]: _.8.1784 - 30.11.1784\n*[[Hendrik Doeff]]: 14.11.1803 - 6.12.1817\n*[[Jan Cock Blomhoff]]: 6.12.1817 - 20.11.1823\n*[[Janus Henricus Donker Curtius]]: 2.11.1852 - 28.2.1860  [''Donker Curtius became the last in a long list of hardy Dutch opperhoofden who were stationed at Dejima; and fortuitously, Curtius also became the first of many Dutch diplomatic and trade representatives in Japan during the burgeoning pre-Meiji years.'']{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n{{see also|VOC Opperhoofden in Japan}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Dutchmen with Courtesans Nagasaki c1800.jpg|''Dutchmen with Keiseis'' (Courtesans), Nagasaki, c. 1800.\nFile:HendrikDoeffJapan.jpg|[[Hendrik Doeff]] and a Balinese servant in Dejima, Japanese painting, c. early 19th century.\nFile:Nagasaki Dejima C1821.jpg|Monument erected in Dejima by [[Philipp Franz von Siebold|Siebold]] to honor Kaempfer and Thunberg\nFile:Dejima-scale-model.jpg|Scale model of Dutch trading post on display in Dejima (1995)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dutch missions to Edo]]\n* [[Japan\u2013Netherlands relations]]\n* [[Nanban trade]]\n* [[Sakoku]]\n* ''[[The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet]]'' - Historical novel set in Dejima\n* [[Nagasaki foreign settlement]]\n* [[Thirteen Factories]], a former area of [[Guangzhou]], China, where the first foreign trade was allowed in the 18th century since the ''[[hai jin]]'' (\u6d77\u7981) ban on maritime activities.\n* ''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG]]'' - Much of the action centers on refugees who are settled on the island and eventually try to declare independence\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Blomhoff, J.

Descriptive statistics is distinguished from [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]] (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], rather than use the data to learn about the [[statistical population|population]] that the sample of data is thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of [[probability theory]], and are frequently [[nonparametric statistics]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dodge |first=Y. |year=2003 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-850994-4 }}</ref>  Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically a table is included giving the overall [[sample size]], sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group), and [[demographic]] or clinical characteristics such as the [[average]] age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related [[comorbidity|comorbidities]], etc.\n\nSome measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of [[central tendency]] and measures of variability or [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]]. Measures of central tendency include the [[mean]], [[median]] and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]], while measures of variability include the [[standard deviation]] (or [[variance]]), the minimum and maximum values of the variables, [[kurtosis]] and [[skewness]].<ref name=Inv>Investopedia, [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp#axzz2DxCoTnMM Descriptive Statistics Terms]</ref>\n\n==Use in statistical analysis==\nDescriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], i.e. [[summary statistics]], or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs. These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation.\n\nFor example, the shooting [[percentage]] in [[basketball]] is a descriptive statistic that summarizes the performance of a player or a team. This number is the number of shots made divided by the number of shots taken. For example, a player who shoots 33% is making approximately one shot in every three. The percentage summarizes or describes multiple discrete events. Consider also the [[grade point average]]. This single number describes the general performance of a student across the range of their course experiences.<ref name=\"trochim\">{{cite web|last=Trochim|first=William M. K.|title=Descriptive statistics|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/statdesc.php|work=Research Methods Knowledge Base|accessdate=14 March 2011|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe use of descriptive and summary statistics has an extensive history and, indeed, the simple tabulation of populations and of economic data was the first way the topic of [[statistics]] appeared. More recently, a collection of summarisation techniques has been formulated under the heading of [[exploratory data analysis]]: an example of such a technique is the [[box plot]].\n\nIn the business world, descriptive statistics provides a useful summary of many types of data.  For example, investors and brokers may use a historical account of return behavior by performing empirical and analytical analyses on their investments in order to make better investing decisions in the future.\n\n===Univariate analysis===\n[[Univariate analysis]] involves describing the [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of a single variable, including its central tendency (including the [[mean]], [[median]], and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]) and dispersion (including the [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[quartiles]] of the data-set, and measures of spread such as the [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]]). The shape of the distribution may also be described via indices such as [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]].\nCharacteristics of a variable's distribution may also be depicted in graphical or tabular format, including [[histograms]] and [[stem-and-leaf display]].\n\n===Bivariate and multivariate analysis===\n\nWhen a sample consists of more than one variable, descriptive statistics may be used to describe the relationship between pairs of variables. In this case, descriptive statistics include:\n\n* Cross-tabulations and contingency tables\n* Graphical representation via [[scatterplot]]s\n* Quantitative measures of [[Correlation and dependence|dependence]]\n* Descriptions of [[conditional distribution]]s\n\nThe main reason for differentiating univariate and bivariate analysis is that bivariate analysis is not only simple descriptive analysis, but also it describes the relationship between two different variables.<ref>{{cite book |first=Earl R. |last=Babbie |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=12th |publisher=Wadsworth |year=2009 |isbn=0-495-59841-0 |pages=436\u2013440 }}</ref>\nQuantitative measures of dependence include correlation (such as [[Pearson's r]] when both variables are continuous, or [[Spearman's rho]] if one or both are not) and [[covariance]] (which reflects the scale variables are measured on). The slope, in regression analysis, also reflects the relationship between variables. The unstandardised slope indicates the unit change in the criterion variable for a one unit change in the [[prediction|predictor]]. The standardised slope indicates this change in standardised ([[z-score]]) units.\nHighly skewed data are often transformed by taking logarithms. Use of logarithms makes graphs more symmetrical and look more similar to the [[normal distribution]], making them easier to interpret intuitively.<ref>{{cite book |first=Todd G. |last=Nick |chapter=Descriptive Statistics |title=Topics in Biostatistics |series=[[Methods in Molecular Biology]] |volume=404 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |pages=33\u201352 |isbn=978-1-58829-531-6 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-530-5_3 }}</ref>{{rp|47}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Descriptive Statistics Lecture: University of Pittsburgh Supercourse: http://www.pitt.edu/~super1/lecture/lec0421/index.htm\n\n{{Statistics|descriptive}}\n{{Portal bar|Statistics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Descriptive Statistics}}\n[[Category:Summary statistics]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Descriptive statistics| ]]", "sha1": "1ek6f64w20ydkd1j4xyyd5b3emzd8v8"}}, {"title": "Demographic statistics", "ns": "0", "id": "8189", "revision": {"id": "852150279", "parentid": "841565850", "timestamp": "2018-07-27T00:09:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "comment": "Shouldn't be linked", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{unreferenced|date=July 2012}}\n'''Demographic statistics''' are measures of the characteristics of, or changes to, a population. Records of births, deaths, marriages, immigration and emigration and a regular census of population provide information that is key to making sound decisions about national policy.\n\nA useful summary of such data is the [[population pyramid]]. It provides data about the sex and age distribution of the population in an accessible graphical format.\n\nAnother summary is called the [[life table]]. For a ''cohort'' of persons born in the same year, it traces and projects their life experiences from birth to death. For a given cohort, the proportion expected to survive each year (or decade in an ''abridged life table'') is presented in tabular or graphical form.\n\nThe ratio of males to females by age indicates the consequences of differing mortality rates on the sexes. Thus, while values above one are common for newborns, the ratio dwindles until it is well below one for the older population.\n\n==Collection==\nNational population statistics are usually collected by conducting a [[census]]. However, because these are usually huge logistical exercises, countries normally conduct censuses only once every five to 10 years. Even when a census is conducted it may miss counting everyone (known as [[undercount]]). Also, some people counted in the census may be recorded in a different place than where they usually live, because they are travelling, for example (this may result in [[overcount]]ing). Consequently, raw census numbers are often adjusted to produce ''census estimates'' that identify such statistics as ''resident population'', ''residents, tourists and other visitors'', ''nationals and aliens(non-nationals)''. For privacy reasons, particularly when there are small counts, some census results may be rounded, often to the nearest ten, hundred, thousand and sometimes randomly up, down or to another small number such as within 3 of the actual count.\n\nBetween censuses, administrative data collected by various agencies about population events such as births, deaths, and cross-border migration may be used to produce [[intercensal estimate]]s.\n\n==Population estimates and projections==\n'''Population estimates''' are usually derived from census and other administrative data. Population estimates are normally produced after the date the estimate is for.\n\nSome estimates, such as the ''Usually resident population'' estimate who usually lives in a locality as at the census date, even though the census did not count them within that locality. Census questions usually include a questions about where a person usually lives, whether they are a resident or visitor, or also live somewhere else, to allow these estimates to be made.\n\nOther estimates are concerned with estimating population on a particular date that is different from the census date, for example the middle or end of a calendar or financial year. These estimates often use birth and death records and migration data to adjust census counts for the changes that have happened since the census.\n\n'''Population projections''' are produced in advance of the date they are for. They use time series analysis of existing census data and other sources of population information to forecast the size of future populations. Because there are unknown factors that may affect future population changes, population projections often incorporate high and low as well as expected values for future populations. Population projections are often recomputed after a census has been conducted. It depends on how conjusted the area is in the particular demarcation.\n\n==History==\nWhile many censuses were conducted in antiquity, there are few population statistics that survive. One example though can be found in the Bible, in chapter 1 of the Book of Numbers. Not only are the statistics given, but the method used to compile those statistics is also described. In modern-day terms, this [[metadata]] about the census is probably of as much value as the statistics themselves as it allows researchers to determine not only what was being counted but how and why it was done.\n\n==Metadata==\nModern population statistics are normally accompanied by '''metadata''' that explains how the statistics have been compiled and adjusted to compensate for any collection issues.\n\n==Statistical sources==\nMost countries have a census bureau or government agency responsible for conducting censuses. Many of these agencies publish their country's census results and other population statistics on their agency's website.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Demographic window]]\n*[[Census]] - [[Census Bureau]], [[Census tract]], [[Census block group]], [[Census block]].\n*[[Intercensal estimate]]\n*[[Population projection]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.geohive.com/ Comprehensive global statistics]\n\n{{Statistics|applications}}\n{{Population country lists}}\n\n[[Category:Population statistics| ]]", "sha1": "eil241b6gd8fwlcctpm0eie8umfaqoo"}}, {"title": "Detective fiction", "ns": "0", "id": "8192", "revision": {"id": "866157584", "parentid": "866149329", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T17:18:23Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2600:1700:AD80:9630:4527:674F:8F8C:70A5"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Detective story|other uses|Detective Story (disambiguation){{!}}Detective Story}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2010}}\n{{Globalize|date=March 2010}}\n}}'''Detective fiction''' is a subgenre of [[crime fiction]] and [[mystery fiction]] in which an [[criminal investigation|investigator]] or a [[detective]]\u2014either professional, amateur or retired\u2014investigates a crime, often [[murder]].

H. Pfeiffer,  have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel: 13)|Susanna and the Elders]] (the [[Protestant]] [[Bible]] locates this story within the [[apocrypha]]), the account told by two witnesses broke down when [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] cross-examines them. In response, author [[Julian Symons]] has argued that \"those who search for fragments of detection in the Bible and Herodotus are looking only for puzzles\" and that these puzzles are not detective stories.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaggs|first=John|title=Crime Fiction (The New Critical Idiom)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415318259|page=8}}</ref> In the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' by [[Ancient Greek]] playwright [[Sophocles]], the protagonist discovers the truth about his origins after questioning various witnesses. Although \"Oedipus's enquiry is based on supernatural, pre-rational methods that are evident in most narratives of crime until the development of Enlightenment thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\", this narrative has \"all of the central characteristics and formal elements of the detective story, including a mystery surrounding a murder, a closed circle of suspects, and the gradual uncovering of a hidden past.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaggs|first=John|title=Crime Fiction (The New Critical Idiom)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415318259|pages=9\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Early Arab detective fiction===\nThe oldest known example of a detective story was ''[[The Three Apples]]'', one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'').

When Harun broke open the chest, he discovered the body of a young woman who had been cut into pieces.

One of his rules was to avoid supernatural elements so that the focus remained on the mystery itself.<ref name=\":1\" /> Knox has contended that a detective story \"must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gYL2DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=must+have+as+its+main+interest+the+unravelling+of+a+mystery;+a+mystery+whose+elements+are+clearly+presented+to+the+reader+at+an+early+stage+in+the+proceedings,+and+whose+nature+is+such+as+to+arouse+curiosity,+a+curiosity+which+is+gratified+at+the+end&source=bl&ots=IaoTd6lPzC&sig=DIyzQUd8K01cy-dhqZQr6C9fsY0&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGh_7Vzf7ZAhUMxGMKHet1BtsQ6AEIbjAJ#v=onepage&q=must%20have%20as%20its%20main%20interest%20the%20unravelling%20of%20a%20mystery;%20a%20mystery%20whose%20elements%20are%20clearly%20presented%20to%20the%20reader%20at%20an%20early%20stage%20in%20the%20proceedings,%20and%20whose%20nature%20is%20such%20as%20to%20arouse%20curiosity,%20a%20curiosity%20which%20is%20gratified%20at%20the%20end&f=false|title=Queering Agatha Christie: Revisiting the Golden Age of Detective Fiction|last=Bernthal|first=J.

In this subgenre, great ingenuity may be exercised in narrating the crime, usually a homicide, and the subsequent investigation. This objective was to conceal the identity of the criminal from the reader until the end of the book, when the method and culprit are both revealed. According to scholars Carole Kismaric and Marvi Heiferman, \"The golden age of detective fiction began with high-class amateur detectives sniffing out murderers lurking in rose gardens, down country lanes, and in picturesque villages. Many conventions of the detective-fiction genre evolved in this era, as numerous writers \u2014 from populist entertainers to respected poets \u2014 tried their hands at mystery stories.\"<ref name=\"NDHB\" />\n\nJohn Dickson Carr \u2014 who also wrote as Carter Dickson \u2014 used the \u201cpuzzle\u201d approach in his writing which was characterized by including a complex puzzle for the reader to try to unravel. He created ingenious and seemingly impossible plots and is regarded as the master of the \"locked room mystery\". Two of Carr\u2019s most famous works are ''The Case of Constant Suicides'' (1941) and ''The Hollow Man'' (1935).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/top-10-locked-room-mysteries-adrian-mckinty|title=The top 10 locked-room mysteries|last=McKinty|first=Adrian|date=2014-01-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> Another author, Cecil Street \u2014 who also wrote as John Rhode \u2014 wrote of a detective, Dr. Priestley, who specialised in elaborate technical devices. In the United States, the whodunit subgenre was adopted and extended by Rex Stout and Ellery Queen, along with others. The emphasis on formal rules during the Golden Age produced great works, albeit with highly standardized form. The most successful novels of this time included \u201can original and exciting plot; distinction in the writing, a vivid sense of place, a memorable and compelling hero and the ability to draw the reader into their comforting and highly individual world.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==='Whodunit'===\n{{main|Whodunit|}}\nA '''''whodunit''''' or '''''whodunnit''''' (a colloquial elision of \"Who [has] done it?\" or \"Who did it?\") is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]. The \"whodunit\" flourished during the so-called \"[[Golden Age of Detective Fiction|Golden Age]]\" of detective fiction, between 1920 and 1950, when it was the predominant mode of crime writing.\n\n=== Agatha Christie ===\nAgatha Christie is not only the most famous Golden Age writer, but also considered one of the most famous authors of all genres of all time.

[https://books.google.ca/books?id=iYq7D2VCmc0C&printsec=frontcover&hl=zh-CN&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Detective Fiction'']. Polity. {{ISBN|9780745629421}}.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1920s, [[Al Capone]] and the Mob were inspiring not only fear, but piquing mainstream curiosity about the American [[Organized crime|crime underworld]]. Popular [[pulp fiction magazine]]s like ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' capitalized on this, as authors such as Carrol John Daly published violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Very often, no actual mystery even existed: the books simply revolved around justice being served to those who deserved harsh treatment, which was described in explicit detail.\"<ref name=\"NDHB\" /> The overall theme these writers portrayed reflected \"the changing face of America itself.\"<ref name=\"google2005\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the primary contributors to this style was [[Dashiell Hammett]] with his famous private investigator character, Sam Spade.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Messent, P. (2006). ''Introduction: From private eye to police procedural--the logic of contemporary crime fiction''</ref> His style of crime fiction came to be known as \"[[hardboiled]]\", which is described as a genre that \"usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> \"Told in stark and sometimes elegant language through the unemotional eyes of new hero-detectives, these stories were an American phenomenon.\"<ref name=\"NDHB\" />\n\nIn the late 1930s, [[Raymond Chandler]] updated the form with his private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced \"operatives report\" style of Hammett's Continental Op stories.<ref>Beal, W. (2014). Philip marlowe, family man. ''College Literature, 41''(2), 11-28. 10.1353/lit.2014.0021</ref> Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. [[James Hadley Chase]] wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main hero, including ''Blonde's Requiem'' (1945), ''Lay Her Among the Lilies'' (1950), and ''Figure It Out for Yourself'' (1950). Heroes of these novels are typical private eyes very similar or plagiarized from Raymond Chandler's work.<ref>Pristed, B. B. (2013). Glasnost noire: The soviet and post-soviet publication and reception of james hadley chase. ''Book History, 16''(1), 329-363. 10.1353/bh.2013.0000</ref>\n\n[[Ross Macdonald]], pseudonym of [[Kenneth Millar]], updated the form again with his detective [[Lew Archer]]. Archer, like Hammett's fictional heroes, was a camera eye, with hardly any known past. \"Turn Archer sideways, and he disappears,\" one reviewer wrote. Two of Macdonald's strengths were his use of psychology and his beautiful prose, which was full of imagery. Like other '[[hardboiled]]' writers, Macdonald aimed to give an impression of realism in his work through violence, sex and confrontation. The 1966 movie ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' starring [[Paul Newman]] was based on the first Lew Archer story ''[[The Moving Target]]'' (1949). Newman reprised the role in ''[[The Drowning Pool]]'' in 1976.\n\n[[Michael Collins (author)|Michael Collins]], pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, is generally considered the author who led the form into the Modern Age. His PI, [[Dan Fortune]], was consistently involved in the same sort of David-and-Goliath stories that Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald wrote, but Collins took a sociological bent, exploring the meaning of his characters' places in society and the impact society had on people. Full of commentary and clipped prose, his books were more intimate than those of his predecessors, dramatizing that crime can happen in one's own living room.\n\nThe PI novel was a male-dominated field in which female authors seldom found publication until [[Marcia Muller]], [[Sara Paretsky]], and [[Sue Grafton]] were finally published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each author's detective, also female, was brainy and physical and could hold her own.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Nora|first=Martin,|title=\"In the business of believing women's stories\": Feminism through detective fiction (Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton)|date=1996|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|url=http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/3/|language=en}}</ref> Their acceptance, and success, caused publishers to seek out other female authors.\n\n=== [[Inverted detective story|Inverted detective]] ===\nAn inverted detective story, also known as a \"'''howcatchem'''\", is a [[murder]] [[mystery fiction]] structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning,<ref name=\":0\" /> usually including the identity of the perpetrator.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15696167|title=Dictionary of literary themes and motifs|date=1988|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Seigneuret, Jean-Charles.|isbn=9780313263965|location=New York|oclc=15696167}}</ref> The story then describes the detective's attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical \"[[whodunit]]\", where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story's climax.\n\n===[[Police procedural]]===\nMany detective stories have [[police]] officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously. Some of these stories are whodunits; in others, the criminal is well known, and it is a case of getting enough evidence.\n\nIn the 1940s the police procedural evolved as a new style of detective fiction. Unlike the heroes of Christie, Chandler, and Spillane, the police detective was subject to error and was constrained by rules and regulations. As Gary Huasladen says in ''Places for Dead Bodies'', \"not all the clients were insatiable bombshells, and invariably there was life outside the job.\" The detective in the police procedural does the things police officers do to catch a criminal. Writers include [[Ed McBain]], [[P. D. James]], and [[Bartholomew Gill]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://libguides.enc.edu/mysteryfiction/genres|title=LibGuides: Mystery Fiction and Film: Genres of Mystery and Crime Fiction|last=Hwang|first=Amy|website=libguides.enc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Historical mystery]] ===\nThese works are set in a time period considered historical from the author's perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit [[Ellis Peters]]'s ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael Chronicles]]'' (1977\u20131994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474|title=Historical Mystery Novels|last=Jr|first=David B.

Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous and thematic (culinary mystery, animal mystery, quilting mystery, etc.)\n\nThis style features minimal violence, sex, and social relevance; a solution achieved by intellect or intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end; honorable and well bred characters; and a setting in a closed community. Writers include [[Agatha Christie]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[Elizabeth Daly]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Serial killer mystery ===\nAnother subgenre of detective fiction is the [[serial killer]] mystery, which might be thought of as an outcropping of the police procedural. There are early mystery novels in which a police force attempts to contend with the type of criminal known in the 1920s as a homicidal maniac, such as a few of the early novels of [[Philip Macdonald]] and [[Ellery Queen]]'s ''[[Cat of Many Tails]]''. However, this sort of story became much more popular after the coining of the phrase \"serial killer\" in the 1970s and the publication of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in 1988. These stories frequently show the activities of many members of a police force or government agency in their efforts to apprehend a killer who is selecting victims on some obscure basis. They are also often much more violent and suspenseful than other mysteries.\n\n=== [[Legal thriller]] or courtroom ===\nThe [[legal thriller]] or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the [[police procedural]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-14|title=Legal thriller|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_thriller&oldid=815435109|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref>  The legal thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller, court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate solution. [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] popularized the courtroom novel in the 20th century with his [[Perry Mason]] series. Contemporary authors of legal thrillers include [[Michael Connelly]], [[Linda Fairstein]], [[John Grisham]], [[John Lescroat]], [[Paul Levine]], [[Lisa Scottoline]], and [[Scott Turow]].\n\n=== [[Locked-room mystery]] ===\nThe '''[[locked-room mystery]]''' is a subgenre of detective fiction in which a [[crime]]\u2014almost always [[murder]]\u2014is committed under circumstances which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was established in the 19th century. Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s  \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841) is considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. The crime in question typically involves a [[crime scene]] with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the [[Evidence|clues]], and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic [[Climax (narrative)|climax]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-06|title=Locked-room mystery|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Locked-room_mystery&oldid=829001010|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Amateur railway detective ===\nOne of the most prolific writers of the railway detective genre is [[Keith Miles]], who is also best known as [[Edward Marston]]. His \"Railway Detective\" series, published by [[Allison & Busby]], is set in the mid-19th century, against the background of the \"Railway Age\". The cases, oftentimes linked with railways, unravel through the endeavors of two Scotland Yard detectives. To the end of 2017, there are sixteen titles in the series.\n\n==Modern criticism of detective fiction==\n===Preserving the story's secrets===\nEven if they do not mean to, advertisers, reviewers, scholars and aficionados sometimes give away details or parts of the plot, and sometimes\u2014for example in the case of [[Mickey Spillane]]'s novel ''[[I, the Jury]]''\u2014even the solution. After the credits of [[Billy Wilder]]'s film ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', the cinemagoers are asked not to talk to anyone about the plot so that future viewers will also be able to fully enjoy the unravelling of the mystery.\n\n===Plausibility and coincidence===\nFor series involving amateur detectives, their frequent encounters with crime often test the limits of plausibility. The character [[Miss Marple]], for instance, dealt with an estimated two murders a year{{Citation needed|reason=Her 12 novels span 40 years. Hardly 2 per year.|date=July 2018}}; De Andrea has described Marple's home town, the quiet little village of [[St. Mary Mead]], as having \"put on a pageant of human depravity rivaled only by that of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]\"{{Citation needed|reason=This is a quote. Where is it from?|date=July 2018}}. Similarly, TV heroine [[Jessica Fletcher]] of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' was confronted with bodies wherever she went, but most notably in her small hometown of [[Cabot Cove]], [[Maine]]; ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimated that, by the end of the series' 12-year run, nearly 2% of the town's residents had been killed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/weekinreview/whodunit-that-under-40-crowd.html|title=Whodunit? That Under-40 Crowd|last=Barron|first=James|date=1996-04-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> It is arguably more convincing if police, [[forensics|forensic expert]]s or similar professionals are made the protagonist of a series of crime novels.\n\nThe television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' has often made fun of this implausible frequency. The main character, [[Adrian Monk]], is frequently accused of being a \"bad luck charm\" and a \"murder magnet\" as the result of the frequency with which murder happens in his vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mondayeveningclub.blogspot.ca/2009/02/butler-did-it-passion-for-mystery.html|title=The butler did it: A passion for mystery novels|website=mondayeveningclub.blogspot.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nLikewise Kogoro Mori of the manga series ''[[Detective Conan]]'' got that kind of unflattering reputation. Although Mori is actually a [[private investigator]] with his own agency, the police never intentionally consult him as he stumbles from one crime scene to another.\n\nThe role and legitimacy of coincidence has frequently been the topic of heated arguments ever since [[Ronald A. Knox]] categorically stated that \"no accident must ever help the detective\" (Commandment No. 6 in his \"Decalogue\").<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv186.html|title=Father Knox's Decalogue: The Ten Rules of (Golden Age) Detective Fiction|website=www.thrillingdetective.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of technology<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadgoodbooks.co.uk/stav-sherez-crime-fiction-and-technology/|title=Stav Sherez: crime fiction and technology \u2013 Dead Good|date=2017-01-29|work=Dead Good|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>===\nTechnological progress has also rendered many plots implausible and antiquated. For example, the predominance of [[mobile phone]]s, [[pager]]s, and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] has significantly altered the previously dangerous situations in which investigators traditionally might have found themselves.\n\nOne tactic that avoids the issue of technology altogether is the [[Historical whodunnit|historical detective genre]]. As global interconnectedness makes legitimate suspense more difficult to achieve, several writers\u2014including [[Elizabeth Peters]], [[P. C. Doherty]], [[Steven Saylor]], and [[Lindsey Davis]]\u2014have eschewed fabricating convoluted plots in order to manufacture tension, instead opting to set their characters in some former period. Such a strategy forces the protagonist to rely on more inventive means of investigation, lacking as they do the technological tools available to modern detectives.\n\nAs technology advances, so does the genre of crime fiction, as we now have the issue of cyber crime, or a crime that involves a computer and a network.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyber crime: Investigating High-Technology Computer Crime|last=Moore|first=Robert|publisher=Anderson Publishing Co.|year=2005|isbn=1593453035|location=Mississippi|pages=}}</ref> There is also the new issue of cyberterrorism, which is being more frequently incorporated into modern crime fiction.\n\n==Detective Commandments==\nSeveral authors have attempted to set forth a sort of list of \u201cDetective Commandments\u201d for prospective authors of the genre.\n\nAccording to \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories,\" by [[Van Dine's Commandments|Van Dine]] in 1928: \"The detective story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more\u2014it is a sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very definite laws\u2014unwritten, perhaps, but nonetheless binding; and every respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them. Herewith, then, is a sort of credo, based partly on the practice of all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings of the honest author's inner conscience.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/vandine.htm |title=Twenty rules for writing detective stories (1928) by S.

The first appearance of [[Sherlock Holmes]] is at \u201c[[A Study in Scarlet|A study in Scarlet]]\u201d.

[[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]] tried to kill [[Sherlock Holmes]] after twenty three stories, but because of people\u2019s request, he had to continue writing Sherlock Holmes series. Today, Sherlock Holmes popularity became more obsessive since past. Sherlock Holmes is not only reference as one character from detective fiction but also influenced in many other area. For example, due to enormous fandom all around the world, TV series based on Sherlock Holmes have been created; title named as \u201cSherlock\u201d. Because of Holmes, Conan Doyle was \u201cwell-known as [[Queen Victoria]]\u201d.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/>\n\n=== [[Hercule Poirot]] ===\n'''Hercule Poirot''' is a fictional Belgian private detective, created by [[Agatha Christie]]. As the one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, he appeared in 33 novels, one play ([[Black Coffee (play)|''Black Coffee'']]), and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975. The stories are throughout the Hercule Poirot\u2019s whole life in the UK, which he first appeared in ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' (published in 1920) and died in [[Curtain (novel)|''Curtain'']] (published in 1975), which is Agatha Christie\u2019s last work.

His ambitions were great and he was able to buy a country estate and a ship (as well as [[civet]]s to make perfume), though he was rarely out of debt.

[[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] and her husband [[William III of England|William III]] were jointly crowned in 1688, and Defoe became one of William's close allies and a secret agent.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> Some of the new policies led to conflict with France, thus damaging prosperous trade relationships for Defoe, who had established himself as a merchant.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> In 1692, Defoe was arrested for debts of \u00a3700, though his total debts may have amounted to \u00a317,000.

By 1695, he was back in England, now formally using the name \"Defoe\" and serving as a \"commissioner of the glass duty\", responsible for collecting taxes on bottles. In 1696, he ran a tile and brick factory in what is now [[Tilbury]] in [[History of Essex|Essex]] and lived in the parish of [[Chadwell St Mary]].\n\n== Writing ==\n\nAs many as 545 titles have been ascribed to Defoe, ranging from satirical poems, political and religious pamphlets, and volumes. ([[P. N. Furbank|Furbank]] and Owens argue for the much smaller number of 276 published items in ''Critical Bibliography'' (1998).) \n\n=== Pamphleteering and prison ===\n[[File:Daniel Defoe by James Charles Armytage.jpg|thumb|Daniel Defoe in the [[pillory]], 1862 line engraving by [[James Charles Armytage]] after [[Eyre Crowe (painter)|Eyre Crowe]]]]\n\nDefoe's first notable publication was ''[[An essay upon projects]]'', a series of proposals for social and economic improvement, published in 1697. From 1697 to 1698, he defended the right of King [[William III of England|William III]] to a [[standing army]] during disarmament, after the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) had ended the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u201397). His most successful poem, ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' (1701), defended the king against the perceived xenophobia of his enemies, satirising the English claim to racial purity. In 1701, Defoe presented the ''Legion's Memorial'' to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], then [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] - and his subsequent employer - while flanked by a guard of sixteen gentlemen of quality. It demanded the release of the Kentish petitioners, who had asked Parliament to support the king in an imminent war against France.\n\nThe death of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1702 once again created a political upheaval, as the king was replaced by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] who immediately began her offensive against [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> Defoe was a natural target, and his pamphleteering and political activities resulted in his arrest and placement in a [[pillory]] on 31 July 1703, principally on account of his December 1702 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Shortest Way with the Dissenters|The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church]]'', purporting to argue for their extermination.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/27/12.html|author=Daniel Defoe|year=1702|title=The shortest way with the Dissenters|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> In it, he ruthlessly satirised both the [[High church]] [[Tory|Tories]] and those [[Dissenter]]s who hypocritically practised so-called \"occasional conformity\", such as his [[Stoke Newington]] neighbour Sir [[Thomas Abney]]. It was published anonymously, but the true authorship was quickly discovered and Defoe was arrested.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> He was charged with seditious libel. Defoe was found guilty after a trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in front of the notoriously sadistic judge [[Salathiel Lovell]].<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\"/> Lovell sentenced him to a punitive fine of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], to public humiliation in a [[pillory]], and to an indeterminate length of imprisonment which would only end upon the discharge of the punitive fine.<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\"/> According to legend, the publication of his poem ''Hymn to the Pillory'' caused his audience at the pillory to throw flowers instead of the customary harmful and noxious objects and to drink to his health. The truth of this story is questioned by most scholars, although [[John Robert Moore]] later said that \"no man in England but Defoe ever stood in the pillory and later rose to eminence among his fellow men\".<ref name = rich/> \n{{Quote box\n |quote = \"Wherever God erects a house of prayer<br />the Devil always builds a chapel there;<br />And 't will be found, upon examination,<br />the latter has the largest congregation.\"\n |source = \u2013 Defoe's ''The True-Born Englishman'', 1701\n}}\n\nAfter his three days in the pillory, Defoe went into [[Newgate Prison]]. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], brokered his release in exchange for Defoe's co-operation as an intelligence agent for the Tories. In exchange for such co-operation with the rival political side, Harley paid some of Defoe's outstanding debts, improving his financial situation considerably.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> \n\nWithin a week of his release from prison, Defoe witnessed the [[Great Storm of 1703]], which raged through the night of 26/27 November. It caused severe damage to London and [[Bristol]], uprooted millions of trees, and killed more than 8,000 people, mostly at sea. The event became the subject of Defoe's ''[[The Storm (Daniel Defoe)|The Storm]]'' (1704), which includes a collection of witness accounts of the tempest.<ref>''The Storm: or, a collection of the most remarkable casualties and disasters which happen'd in the late dreadful tempest, both by sea and land''. London: 1704.</ref> Many regard it as one of the world's first examples of modern journalism.<ref>[[John J. Miller (journalist)|John J. Miller]] (13 August 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904800304576476142821212156?KEYWORDS=masterpiece \"Writing Up a Storm\"], ''The Wall Street Journal''.</ref> \n\nIn the same year, he set up his [[Periodical literature|periodical]] ''A Review of the Affairs of France'' which supported the [[Harley Ministry]], chronicling the events of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1702\u201314). The ''Review'' ran three times a week without interruption until 1713. Defoe was amazed that a man as gifted as Harley left vital state papers lying in the open, and warned that he was almost inviting an unscrupulous clerk to commit treason; his warnings were fully justified by the [[William Gregg (clerk and spy)|William Gregg]] affair. \n\nWhen Harley was ousted from the ministry in 1708, Defoe continued writing the ''Review'' to support [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], then again to support Harley and the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]] in the Tory ministry of 1710\u201314. The Tories fell from power with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], but Defoe continued doing intelligence work for the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] government, writing \"Tory\" pamphlets that undermined the Tory point of view.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>\n\nNot all of Defoe's pamphlet writing was political. One pamphlet was originally published anonymously, entitled \"''A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs. Veal the Next Day after her Death to One Mrs. Bargrave at Canterbury the 8th of September, 1705''.\" It deals with interaction between the spiritual realm and the physical realm and was most likely written in support of [[Charles Drelincourt]]'s ''The Christian Defense against the Fears of Death'' (1651). It describes Mrs. Bargrave's encounter with her old friend Mrs. Veal after she had died. It is clear from this piece and other writings that the political portion of Defoe's life was by no means his only focus.\n\n=== Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 ===\n{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}<!--lots of paragraphs without citations-->\n\n[[File:Defoe 1709 The History Of The Union Of Great Britain.JPG|thumb|Title page from Daniel Defoe's: ''The History of the Union of Great Britain'' dated 1709 and printed in Edinburgh by the Heirs of Anderson]]\nIn despair during his imprisonment for the seditious libel case, Defoe wrote to [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], the London Scot and founder of the [[Bank of England]] and part instigator of the [[Darien scheme]], who was in the confidence of [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], leading minister and spymaster in the [[Governance of England|English Government]]. Harley accepted Defoe's services and released him in 1703. He immediately published ''The Review'', which appeared weekly, then three times a week, written mostly by himself. This was the main mouthpiece of the English Government promoting the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]].\n\nIn 1709, Defoe authored a rather lengthy book entitled ''The History of the Union of Great Britain'', an Edinburgh publication printed by the Heirs of Anderson.<ref>[http://truescans.com/index-Defoe.htm ''The History Of The Union Of Great Britain'', 1709; Edinburgh, Heirs of Anderson.] at TrueScans</ref> The book was not published anonymously and cites Defoe twice as being its author.<ref>[http://truescans.com/Images/Defoe_1709/DSCN9162.JPG First Defoe book author reference \u2013 cited as DANIEL DEFOE]. truescans.com.

Retrieved 31 July 2013.</ref> This so-called \"first draft\" for unification took place 100 years before the signing of the 1707 accord, which respectively preceded the commencement of ''Robinson Crusoe'' by another ten years.\n\nDefoe began his campaign in ''The Review'' and other pamphlets aimed at English opinion, claiming that it would end the threat from the north, gaining for the Treasury an \"inexhaustible treasury of men\", a valuable new market increasing the power of England. By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to [[Edinburgh]] as a secret agent to do everything possible to help secure acquiescence in the [[Treaty of Union]]. He was conscious of the risk to himself. Thanks to books such as ''The Letters of Daniel Defoe'' (edited by G. H. Healey, Oxford 1955), far more is known about his activities than is usual with such agents.\n\nHis first reports included vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. \"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind\", he reported. Years later [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet|John Clerk of Penicuik]], a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin : {{quote|\u2026 to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here.

It was published in folio. There is not one fact in it which I can challenge\"</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nDefoe was a [[Presbyterian]] who had suffered in England for his convictions, and as such he was accepted as an adviser to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and committees of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. He told Harley that he was \"privy to all their folly\" but \"Perfectly unsuspected as with corresponding with anybody in England\". He was then able to influence the proposals that were put to Parliament and reported,\n\n{{quote|Having had the honour to be always sent for the committee to whom these amendments were referr\u00e8d,<br />I have had the good fortune to break their measures in two particulars via the bounty on Corn and<br />proportion of the Excise.}}\n\nFor Scotland, he used different arguments, even the opposite of those which he used in England, usually ignoring the English doctrine of the [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|Sovereignty of Parliament]], for example, telling the Scots that they could have complete confidence in the guarantees in the Treaty. Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion of the time. The same is true of a massive history of the Union which Defoe published in 1709 and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works. Defoe took pains to give his history an air of objectivity by giving some space to arguments against the Union but always having the last word for himself.\n\nHe disposed of the main Union opponent, [[Andrew Fletcher (politician)|Andrew Fletcher]] of [[East Saltoun and West Saltoun|Saltoun]], by ignoring him. Nor does he account for the deviousness of the [[Duke of Hamilton]], the official leader of the various factions opposed to the Union, who seemingly betrayed his former colleagues when he switched to the Unionist/Government side in the decisive final stages of the debate.\n\nDefoe made no attempt to explain why the same Parliament of Scotland which was so vehement for its independence from 1703 to 1705 became so supine in 1706. He received very little reward from his paymasters and of course no recognition for his services by the government. He made use of his Scottish experience to write his ''Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain'', published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union was \"not the case, but rather the contrary\".\n\n[[File:Glasgow Bridge c.1758.JPG|thumb|Glasgow Bridge as Defoe might have seen it in the 18th century]]\nDefoe's description of [[Glasgow]] (Glaschu) as a \"Dear Green Place\" has often been misquoted as a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] translation for the town's name. The Gaelic ''Glas'' could mean grey or green, while ''chu'' means dog or hollow. ''Glaschu'' probably means \"Green Hollow\". The \"Dear Green Place\", like much of Scotland, was a hotbed of unrest against the Union. The local [[St George's-Tron Church|Tron]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] urged his congregation \"to up and anent for the City of God\".\n\nThe \"Dear Green Place\" and \"City of God\" required government troops to put down the rioters tearing up copies of the Treaty at almost every [[mercat cross]] in Scotland. When Defoe visited in the mid-1720s, he claimed that the hostility towards his party was \"because they were English and because of the Union, which they were almost universally exclaimed against\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Late writing and novels ===\nThe extent and particulars are widely contested concerning Defoe's writing in the period from the Tory fall in 1714 to the publication of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in 1719. Defoe comments on the tendency to attribute tracts of uncertain authorship to him in his apologia ''Appeal to Honour and Justice'' (1715), a defence of his part in Harley's Tory ministry (1710\u201314). Other works that anticipate his novelistic career include ''The Family Instructor'' (1715), a conduct manual on religious duty; ''Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager'' (1717), in which he impersonates [[Nicolas Mesnager]], the French plenipotentiary who negotiated the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); and ''A Continuation of the [[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' (1718), a satire of European politics and religion, ostensibly written by a [[Muslim]] in Paris.\n\n[[File:Daniel Defoe monument Bunhill Fields.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to \"Daniel De-Foe\", [[Bunhill Fields]], [[City Road]], [[Borough of Islington]], London]]\n\nFrom 1719 to 1724, Defoe published the novels for which he is famous (see below). In the final decade of his life, he also wrote conduct manuals, including ''Religious Courtship'' (1722), ''The Complete English Tradesman'' (1726) and ''The New Family Instructor'' (1727). He published a number of books decrying the breakdown of the social order, such as ''The Great Law of Subordination Considered'' (1724) and ''Everybody's Business is Nobody's Business'' (1725) and works on the supernatural, like ''[[The Political History of the Devil]]'' (1726), ''A System of Magick'' (1727) and ''An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions'' (1727). His works on foreign travel and trade include ''A General History of Discoveries and Improvements'' (1727) and ''Atlas Maritimus and Commercialis'' (1728). Perhaps his greatest achievement with the novels is the magisterial ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'' (1724\u201327), which provided a panoramic survey of British trade on the eve of the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n====''The Complete English Tradesman''====\n\nPublished in 1726, ''The Complete English Tradesman'' is an example of Defoe's political works. He discusses the role of the tradesman in England in comparison to tradesmen internationally, arguing that the British system of trade is far superior.<ref name=defoe1 /> He also implies that trade is the backbone of the British economy: \"estate's a pond, but trade's a spring.\"<ref name=defoe1>[Defoe, Daniel. The complete English tradesman. London: Tegg, 1841. Print.]</ref> He praises the practicality of trade not only within the economy but the social stratification as well. Most of the British [[gentry]], he argues is at one time or another inextricably linked with the institution of trade, either through personal experience, marriage or genealogy.<ref name=defoe1 /> Oftentimes younger members of noble families entered into trade. Marriage to a tradesman's daughter by a [[nobleman]] was also common. Overall Defoe demonstrated a high respect for '''tradesmen''', being one himself.\n\nNot only does Defoe elevate individual British tradesmen to the level of [[gentleman]], but he praises the entirety of British trade as a superior system.<ref name=defoe1 /> Trade, Defoe argues is a much better catalyst for social and economic change than war. He states that through [[imperialism]] and trade expansion the British empire is able to \"increase commerce at home\" through job creation and increased [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].<ref name= defoe1 /> He states that increased consumption, by laws of supply and demand, increases production and in turn raises wages for the poor therefore lifting part of British society further out of poverty.<ref name=defoe1 />\n\n=== Novels ===\n*''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719)\n*''[[The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719)\n*''[[Memoirs of a Cavalier]]'' (1720)\n*''[[Captain Singleton]]'' (1720)\n*''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' (1722)\n*''[[Colonel Jack]]'' (1722)\n*''[[Moll Flanders]]'' (1722)\n*''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress]]'' (1724)\n\n====''Robinson Crusoe''====\n\nDefoe's novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), written when he was in his late fifties,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013179902|title=Daniel Defoe|last=Minto|first=William|date=|publisher=Harper & Bros.|year=1879|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|oclc=562533988}}</ref> relates the story of a man's shipwreck on a desert island for twenty-eight years and his subsequent adventures.  Throughout its episodic narrative, Crusoe's struggles with faith are apparent as he bargains with God in times of life-threatening crises, but time and again he turns his back after his deliverances. He is finally content with his lot in life, separated from society, following a more genuine conversion experience. Usually read as fiction, a coincidence of background geography suggests that this may be non-fiction.  In the opening pages of ''[[The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', the author describes how Crusoe settled in [[Bedford]], married and produced a family, and that when his wife died, he went off on these further adventures.  Bedford is also the place where the brother of \"H. F.\" in ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' retired to avoid the danger of the plague, so that by implication, if these works were not fiction, Defoe's family met Crusoe in Bedford, from whence the information in these books was gathered.  Defoe went to school in Stoke Newington, London, with a friend named Caruso.\n\nThe novel has been assumed to be based in part on the story of the Scottish castaway [[Alexander Selkirk]], who spent four years stranded in the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]],<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> but this is inconsistent with the details of the narrative.  The island Selkirk lived on was named M\u00e1s a Tierra (Closer to Land) at the time and was renamed [[Robinson Crusoe Island]] in 1966. It has been supposed that Defoe may have also been inspired by the Latin or English translation of a book by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab Muslim polymath [[Ibn Tufail]], who was known as \"Abubacer\" in Europe. The Latin edition of the book was entitled ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' and it was an earlier novel that is also set on a deserted island.<ref>Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.</ref><ref>Cyril Glass\u00e9 (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Rowman Altamira, p. 202, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.</ref><ref name=Amber>{{cite journal|author=Amber Haque |year=2004|title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=43|issue=4|pages= 357\u201377 [369]|jstor=27512819|doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}</ref><ref name=Wainwright>Martin Wainwright (22 March 2003) [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n[[File:Daniel Defoe former house England.jpg|thumb|A house where Defoe once lived, near London, England]]\n\n====''Captain Singleton''====\n\nDefoe's next novel was ''[[Captain Singleton]]'' (1720), an adventure story whose first half covers a traversal of Africa and whose second half taps into the contemporary fascination with [[piracy]]. It has been commended for its sensitive depiction of the close relationship between the hero and his religious mentor, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] William Walters.\n\n==== ''Memoirs of a Cavalier'' ====\n\n''[[Memoirs of a Cavalier]]'' (1720) is set during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[English Civil War]].\n\n==== ''A Journal of the Plague Year'' ====\n\nA novel often read as non-fiction, this is an account of the Great Plague of London in 1665.  It is undersigned by the initials \"H. F.\", suggesting the author's uncle Henry Foe as a primary source.  It is an historical account of the events based on extensive research, published in 1722.\n\n<blockquote>''Bring out your dead!'' The ceaseless chant of doom echoed through a city of emptied streets and filled grave pits. For this was London in the year of 1665, the Year of the Great Plague&nbsp;\u2026 In 1721, when the Black Death again threatened the European Continent, Daniel Defoe wrote \"[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]\" to alert an indifferent populace to the horror that was almost upon them. Through the eyes of a saddler who had chosen to remain while multitudes fled, the master realist vividly depicted a plague-stricken city. He re-enacted the terror of a helpless people caught in a tragedy they could not comprehend: the weak preying on the dying, the strong administering to the sick, the sinful orgies of the cynical, the quiet faith of the pious. With dramatic insight he captured for all time the death throes of a great city.<p>\u2014 Back cover of the New American Library version of \"A Journal of the Plague Year\"; Signet Classic, 1960</blockquote>\n\n==== ''Colonel Jack'' ====\n\n'''''[[Colonel Jack]]''''' (1722) follows an orphaned boy from a life of poverty and crime to colonial prosperity, military and marital imbroglios, and religious conversion, driven by a problematic notion of becoming a \"gentleman.\"\n\n==== ''Moll Flanders''  ====\nAlso in 1722, Defoe wrote '''''[[Moll Flanders]]''''', another first-person [[picaresque novel]] of the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England. The titular heroine appears as a whore, bigamist, and thief, lives in [[Liberty of the Mint|The Mint]], commits adultery and incest, and yet manages to retain the reader's sympathy. Her savvy manipulation of both men and wealth earns her a life of trials but ultimately an ending in reward. Although Moll struggles with the morality of some of her actions and decisions, religion seems to be far from her concerns throughout most of her story. However, like Robinson Crusoe, she finally repents. ''Moll Flanders'' is an important work in the development of the novel, as it challenged the common perception of femininity and gender roles in 18th-century British society, and it has come to be widely regarded as an example of [[erotica]].<ref name=\"timeout\">https://www.timeout.com/london/books/sex-and-books-londons-most-erotic-writers-2</ref><ref name=\"historyextra\">https://www.historyextra.com/period/moll-the-life-and-times-of-moll-flanders/</ref>\n\n'''''Roxana'''''\n\n''Moll Flanders'' and Defoe's final novel, '''''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress]]''''' (1724), are examples of the remarkable way in which Defoe seems to inhabit his fictional characters (yet \"drawn from life\"), not least in that they are women. ''Roxana'' narrates the moral and spiritual decline of a high society courtesan. ''Roxana'' differs from other Defoe works because the main character does not exhibit a conversion experience, even though she claims to be a penitent later in her life, at the time that she's relaying her story.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bunhill Fields, London 13.JPG|thumb|Bunhill Fields monument detail]]\nDaniel Defoe died on 24 April 1731, probably while in hiding from his creditors.
