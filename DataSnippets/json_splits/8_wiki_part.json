According to a version of the [[Ariadne]] legend noted by [[Plutarch]],<ref>Plutarch, ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Theseus (20.3-.5), citing the lost text of an obscure Amathusan mythographer, [[Paeon of Amathus|Paeon]].</ref> [[Theseus]] abandoned Ariadne at Amathousa, where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb. According to Plutarch's source, Amathousians called the [[sacred grove]] where her shrine was situated the Wood of Aphrodite Ariadne. More purely Hellenic myth would have Amathus settled instead by one of the sons of [[Heracles]], thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there.\n \nIt was said in antiquity that the people of Amathus were [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]], or \"[[Pelasgian]]\".<ref name=\"OCD\"/> Their non-Greek language is confirmed on the site by [[Eteocypriot]] inscriptions in the [[Cypriot syllabary]] which alone in the Aegean world survived the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and continued to be used down to the 4th century BC.\n \nAmathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbour and flourished at an early date, soon requiring several cemeteries. Greeks from [[Euboea]] left their pottery at Amathus from the 10th century BC. During the post-Phoenician era of the 8th century BC, a [[palace]] was erected and a port was also constructed, which served the trade with the [[Greeks]] and the [[Levant]]ines.

According to the legend, it was where festive [[Adonia]] took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions; they also competed in dancing and singing, all to the honour of Adonis.\n[[File:Poisson polychrome terre cuite chypre amathonte Louvre AM 976.jpg|thumb|Fish, polychromic terracotta, 5th century BCE, found in Amathus]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Apollo Amathus.jpg|thumb|portrait|left|Apollo Temple at Amathus-[[Limassol]]]] -->\nThe earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early [[Iron Age]] period of Graeco-[[Phoenicia]]n influences (1000-600 BC).

As it hung there empty, a swarm of bees entered it and filled it with honeycomb.<ref>The [[mytheme]] of bees in the carcase, familiar from the legend of [[Samson]] ( Judges 14:8, a lion's carcase) and the Greek myth of [[Aristaeus]] (a bullock carcase), and in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', is examined by Othniel Margalith, \"Samson's Riddle and Samson's Magic Locks\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'', '''36'''.2 (1986:.</ref> When they sought advice about this event, an oracle told them to take the head down and bury it, and to make annual sacrifice to Onesilos as a hero, saying that it would be better for them if they did this. The Amathusians did as they were told and still perform these rites in my day.\" (''Histories'' 5.114)\n\nAmathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture (grain<ref>[[Strabo]] 340, quoting the mid-6th century writer [[Hipponax]].</ref> and sheep) and copper mines situated very close to the northeast [[Tenta, Cyprus|Kalavasos]].<ref>See [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' x. 220, 227. 531.</ref><ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>G. Mariti, i. 187; L. Ross, ''Inselreise,'' iv. 195; W. H. Engel, ''Kypros,'' i. 111 ff.</ref>\n\n===Hellenistic Era===\nAbout 385-380 BC, the philhellene [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]] of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus, allied with [[Citium]] and [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]];<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] xiv. 98.</ref> and even after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]].<ref>Diodorus Siculus xix. 62.</ref> Its political importance was now ended but its temple of [[Adonis]] and [[Amathusia|Aphrodite Amathusia]] remained famous in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. The epithet ''Amathusia'' in Roman poetry often means little more than \"Cypriote,\" but attesting to the fame of the city.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom the 4th century BC the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last Basileus of Amathous, Androkles, representing his two sons, Orestheus and Andragoras, have survived. Their inscriptions are in both Eteozypric and Greek languages.\n\nThe decline of Amathous is often measured by the Ptolemaic gifts to [[Argos]], where Amathous donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. However, the port of Paphos lost traffic compared to Amathous in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathous.<ref>Giorgos Papantoniou: Religion and Social Transformations in Cyprus. From the Cypriot Basileis to the Hellenistic Strategos, Brill, 2012, S. 221.</ref>\n\n===Roman Era===\n\nIn the Roman era Amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of Cyprus.\n\nA Roman temple was built in the 1st century AD on top of the Hellenistic predecessor. The temple facilities remained so important in Roman times that 'Amathusia' was used as a synonym for 'Cypriot'.\n\n===Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages===\nLater, in the 4th century AD, Amasus became the see of a Christian bishop and continued to flourish until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. Of its bishops, Heliodorus was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and Alexander at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. In the late 6th century, Saint Ioannis Eleimonas (John the Charitable), protector of the [[Knights of St. John]], was born in Amathus and after 614 sent Theodorus, bishop of Amathus, to Jerusalem to ransom some slaves.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1063-1066</ref><ref>Sim\u00e9on Vailh\u00e9, v.

II, Paris 1914, coll. 982-983</ref>\n\nToday, Amathus is a see of the [[Church of Cyprus]] and is also listed (under the name \"Amathus in Cypro\", to distinguish it from \"[[Amathus, Transjordan|Amathus in Transjordan]]\") as a [[titular see]] by the Catholic Church, which however, in line with the practice adopted after the [[Second Vatican Council]], has made no appointments to the bishopric since the death of the last [[Latin Church|Latin]] [[titular bishop]] in 1984.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 830</ref>\n\n[[Anastasius Sinaita]], the famous 7th-century prolific monk of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], was born here. It is thought that he left Cyprus after the 649 Arab conquest of the island, setting out for the Holy Land, and eventually becoming a monk on Sinai.<ref>A. Binggeli, 'Anastasius of Sinai' in D.

Much later, in 1869, a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the [[Suez Canal]]. A ruined [[Byzantian Empire|Byzantine]] church marks its site.\n\n===In modern times===\nA new settlement close to Amathus but further inland, Agios Tychonas, is named after the bishop Saint [[Tychon of Amathus]]. The site of the ruins is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins: it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis.\n\n==The Site and Archaeology==\n\nThe city had vanished, except for fragments of wall and of a great stone urn on the acropolis,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> dating from the 6th century BC of which a similar vessel was taken to the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in 1867. It is {{convert|1.85|m|0|abbr=on}} tall and weighs 14 tons. It was made from a single piece of stone and has four curved handles carved with bulls. In the 1870s, [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola]] excavated the [[necropolis]] of Amathus, as elsewhere in Cyprus, enriching the early collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; some objects went to the [[British Museum]]. More modern archaeological joint Cypriote-French excavations started in 1980 and still continue. The Acropolis, the Temple of Aphrodite, the agora, the city's walls, the [[basilica]] and the port have all been excavated.\n\nFurther archaeological objects found during the excavations are preserved at both the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia and the Limassol District Archaeological Museum.\n \nIn the agora there are marble columns decorated with spirals and a huge paved squares. On the coastal side of the city there is an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi-precious stones. Further, near the terraced road leading to the Temple, situated on the top of the cliff, several houses built in a row dating to the Hellenistic period have been discovered. At the east and west extremes of the city the two acropoleis are situated where a number of tombs have been found, many of which are intact.\n\nTwo small sanctuaries, with terracotta votive offerings of Graeco-Phoenician age, lie not far off, but the location of the great shrines of Adonis and Aphrodite have not been identified (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, ''Kypros,'' i. ch.1).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Amphora from Amathus at the British Museum.jpg|Amphora from tomb 52, Amathus, 6th century BC, British Museum\nFile:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 2.jpg|in-situ copy of massive stone vase (original in the [[Louvre]])\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://icarus.umkc.edu/sandbox/perseus/pecs/page.232.a.php Richard Stillwell, ed.

Their importance is considered equal to those of the [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], [[Guarneri]], and [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]] families.

He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby [[Brescia]] experimented, such as Gasparo da Sal\u00f2, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.\n\nThe first violin was ordered by [[Lorenzo De Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be \"made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play\". What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called \"The King\" in 1538 [1]{{Clarify|date=January 2018}}<!--Does this bracketed number mean the first instrument Amati produced in that year, January [or possibly March, considering that Italian years at the time were often reckoned as starting in that month], or is it an artifact from a cut-and-paste job from a possibly copyrighted webpage?-->) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[Catherine De Medici|Catherine de M\u00e9dicis]] the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[Charles IX of France]]. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.\n<ref>Dilworth, John.

They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[Gasparo da Salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&nbsp;cm.\n\n===Nicolo Amati===\n{{main|Nicol\u00f2 Amati}}\n'''Nicol\u00f2 Amati''' (December 3, 1596{{snd}}April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family.

(There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)\n\n=== Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) ===\nThe last maker of the family was Nicol\u00f2's son, [[Girolamo Amati]], known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649{{snd}}February 21, 1740).

But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first.

The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] \u2013 that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\nThis depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians.

Wright \"has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty).

As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings \u201cengendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.<ref>{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}</ref>\u201d\n\n==In historiography==\n[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\n[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, \"frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men\". Moreover, said Herodotus, \"No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle\". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.\n\nHippocrates describes them as: \"They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAmazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.<ref>[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10</ref> [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.\n\nAlthough Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.<ref>[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der K\u00f6niglich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..</ref>\n\n==Medieval and Renaissance literature==\n[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]\n\nAmazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamund\u00e1 River]], a tributary of the Amazon.<ref>It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' (\"Brazil's legends and myths\"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.</ref> Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amaz\u00f4nia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazon\u00eda'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].<ref>Ukert (1849), p. 35.</ref> Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:\n\n{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.<ref>''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104</ref>}}\n\nMedieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a \"manly weapon\" should have been invented by a \"tribe of women\", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].\n\n[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in \"[[The Knight's Tale]]\".\n\n==Historical background==\n[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, \"Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience.\"<ref>P. Walcot, \"Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence\" ''Greece & Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n===Scythians and Sarmatians===\nSpeculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been \"inspired by real warrior women\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, \"Did the Amazons really exist?\" '&#39;Diotima'&#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.\nDavid Anthony notes, \"About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"<ref name=\"anthonyd\">{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]\nUp to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref> Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nBefore modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html \"Warrior Women of Eurasia\"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.</ref>\n<ref>In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.</ref> giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:\n\n{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>}}\n\n===Minoan Crete===\n[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]\n\nWhen [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),<ref>L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, \"Herodotus and anthropology\" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.</ref> placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,<ref>(pp.&nbsp;153 ff)</ref> the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. <!--The following is a \"hard sell\" for an outdated idea: \"The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture.

It is also sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of dead sperm whales.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten.

Following months to years of [[photodegradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62&nbsp;\u00b0C (143.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at {{convert|100|C|0|abbr=on}} it is volatilised into a white vapour.

White crystals of a [[terpene]] known as [[ambrein]] can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool.

In the nineteenth century Ambiorix became a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Folk hero|national hero]] because of his [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against [[Julius Caesar]], as written in Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=Ambiorix |editor=William Smith |editor-link=William Smith (lexicographer) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |pages=138\u2013139 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=1867 |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0147.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143053/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0147.html |archive-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\nIn 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered parts of [[Gaul]] and also [[Belgica]] (Belgium, modern-day Northern France, Luxembourg, part of present-day Netherlands below the [[Rhine]] River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. The [[Eburones]] were ruled by Ambiorix and [[Catuvolcus]]. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their [[harvest]], which had not been good that year. Understandably the [[starving]] Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that [[Military camp|camps]] be built near the Eburones' villages. Each [[centurion]] was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[soldiers]]. This created resentment among the Eburones.\n\nAlthough [[Julius Caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[Atuatuci]], Ambiorix joined [[Catuvolcus]] in the winter of 54 BC in an uprising against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] forces under [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus|Q. Titurius Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|L. Aurunculeius Cotta]].\n\n==Resisting the Romans==\n{{Main|Ambiorix's revolt}}\n[[Image:Li\u00e8ge, Palais Provincial, \u00e9pisodes des guerres d'Ambiorix.JPG|thumb|Ambiorix attacking Roman soldiers, relief at the Li\u00e8ge Provincial Palace]]\nBecause a drought had disrupted his grain supply, Caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious Belgic tribes. Roman troops led by Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they were attacked by them, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta's troops left the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.\n\nElsewhere, another Roman force under [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Q. Tullius Cicero]], brother of the orator [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Marcus]], were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero's camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero's aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar's troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar's troops entered Cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Indutiomarus, a leader of the Treveri, began to harass Labienus's camp daily, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They did so, and routed the remnants of Indutiomarus's army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.\n\n==Caesar's revenge==\nWhen the [[Roman senate]] heard what had happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes. Ambiorix had killed a whole Roman [[Roman legion#Imperial legion|legion]] and five [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]. A Belgic attack on Q. Tullius Cicero, then stationed with a legion in the territory of the [[Nervii]], failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar. The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. According to the writer [[Florus]], Ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the [[Rhine]] and disappeared without a trace.<ref>[[Florus]], iii. 10. \u00a7 8</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nCaesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls, ''[[De Bello Gallico]]''. In this text he also wrote the famous line: \"Of these [three regions], the Belgae are the bravest.\" (\"...&nbsp;''Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae''&nbsp;...\").\n\nAmbiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century. When Belgium became independent in 1830 the national government{{Who|date=January 2015}} started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as [[national heroes]]. In Caesar's ''De Bello Gallico'', Ambiorix and his deeds were rediscovered. In 1841 the Belgian poet Joannes Nolet de Brauwere Van Steeland wrote a [[lyric poetry|lyric]]al [[epic poetry|epic]] about Ambiorix and on September 5, 1866 a statue of Ambiorix was erected on the main market square in [[Tongeren]], Belgium, referred to by Caesar as [[Atuatuca]], i.e. Atuatuca Tungrorum.\n\nToday, Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in [[Belgium|Belgian]] history. Many companies, bars and [[friterie]]s have named themselves after him, and in many Belgian [[comics]] such as [[Suske en Wiske]] and [[Jommeke]] he plays a guest role. There was also a short-lived comic called ''Ambionix'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Ambionix official home page |url=http://www.wimswerts.be/htmlmap/ambionix.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915093052/http://www.wimswerts.be/htmlmap/ambionix.html |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> which featured a scientist teleporting a Belgic chief, loosely based on Ambiorix, to modern-day Belgium.\n\nIn the French comic [[Asterix]], in the album ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', [[Asterix]], [[Obelix]], [[Dogmatix]] and [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] go to Belgium because they are angry with Caesar about his remark that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gauls.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Other sources===\n* Caesar, ''[[Gallic Wars|De Bello Gallico]]'' v. 26-51, vi. 29-43, viii. 24; Dio Cassius xl. 7-11; Florus iii. 10.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.livius.org/am-ao/ambiorix/ambiorix.html Ambiorix]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ambiorix}}\n[[Category:Germanic rulers]]\n[[Category:Belgae]]\n[[Category:Celtic warriors]]\n[[Category:Gaulish rulers]]\n[[Category:Germanic warriors]]\n[[Category:Barbarian people of the Gallic Wars]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC rulers in Europe]]", "sha1": "jxuewfhuiq4ol5l8j06artgj3pz77a9"}}, {"title": "Alfonso VI", "ns": "0", "id": "1699", "redirect": {"title": "Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile"}, "revision": {"id": "846775479", "parentid": "696516381", "timestamp": "2018-06-20T20:23:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "Surtsicna", "id": "6488475"}, "comment": "Alfonso VI is Alfonso VI.

The [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] with Andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes, formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the [[Muisca Confederation|Muisca]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]]. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse{{clarify|date=February 2017}} and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the [[Marajoara culture]]. [[Figurative mound]]s are the most recent types of occupation.\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.<ref name=Wohl_p24_25>Wohl, 2011, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] on the island of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by [[selective cultivation]] and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as ''[[terra preta]] de \u00edndio'' (\"Indian dark earth\").<ref name=Wohl_p25>Wohl, 2011, p. 25.</ref> Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.<ref name=Wohl_p25/>\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. James Stuart Olson wrote: \"The [[Munduruku]] expansion dislocated and displaced the [[Kawah\u00edb people|Kawah\u00edb]], breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups&nbsp;...

Another Spanish explorer, [[Francisco de Orellana]], was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the [[Andes]], to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptised some of the affluents of the Amazonas like [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Jurua]]. The name Amazonas is taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female [[Amazons|Amazon]] warriors from the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic culture]] in Greece.\n\n=== Exploration ===\n[[File:The Mara\u00f1on or Amazon River with the Mission of the Society of Jesus WDL1137.png|thumb|[[Samuel Fritz]]'s 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco]]\n[[File:Indios munduruku.jpg|thumb|Native Munduruk\u00fa<br>Painting by [[Hercules Florence]]]]\n[[Gonzalo Pizarro]] set off in 1541 to explore east of [[Quito]] into the South American interior in search of ''[[El Dorado]]'', the \"city of gold\" and [[La Canela]], the \"valley of [[cinnamon]]\".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana Francisco de Orellana Francisco de Orellana (Spanish explorer and soldier)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503155124/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana |date=3 May 2009 }}. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> He was accompanied by his second-in-command [[Francisco de Orellana]]. After {{convert|170|km|mi}}, the [[Coca River]] joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as [[Puerto Francisco de Orellana]]); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as ''R\u00edo de la Canela'' (\"Cinnamon River\") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana apparently missed the confluence (probably with the [[Aguarico River|Aguarico]]) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died at that village. His men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join Pizarro's larger party. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&nbsp;km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u00f5es, for a further {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542. On the [[Nhamunda River]], a tributary of the Amazon downstream from Manaus, Orellana's party had a fierce battle with warriors who, they reported, were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Orellana's men began referring to the women as [[Amazons]], a reference to the tribe of women warriors from [[Greek mythology]].\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon (''Cinnamomum verum'') is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family ''Lauraceae'') are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n\nIn 1560 another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the [[Orinoco River]], which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.\n\nPortuguese explorer [[Pedro Teixeira]] was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectamazonas.org/brief-history-amazon-exploration|title=A Brief History of Amazon Exploration|last=Graham|first=Devon|publisher=Project Amazonas|accessdate=18 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725230550/http://www.projectamazonas.org/brief-history-amazon-exploration|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian ''[[bandeirante]]'' [[Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares]] led an expedition from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of more than {{convert|10000|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn what is currently Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, a number of [[colonisation|colonial]] and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade, slaving and evangelisation among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the [[Urarina]]. In the late 1600s Czech Jesuit Father [[Samuel Fritz]], apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]] must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called [[Lawriqucha|Lauricocha]], near [[Hu\u00e1nuco]].\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th\u201319th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.<ref name = \"Dias\">[http://redebrasilis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camila-L.-Dias-Jesuit-Maps-and-Political-Discourse-muse.pdf Camila Loureiro Dias, \"Maps and Political Discourse: The Amazon River of Father Samuel Fritz,\" ''The Americas,'' Volume 69, Number 1, July 2012, pp. 95-116.]</ref>\n\n=== Scientific exploration ===\n[[File:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 32.png|thumb|upright|[[Henry Walter Bates]] was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848\u20131859).]]\nEarly scientific, zoological and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n* [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] explored the river in 1743.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326266/Charles-Marie-de-La-Condamine|title=Charles-Marie de La Condamine (French naturalist and mathematician)|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=18 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725132645/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326266/Charles-Marie-de-La-Condamine|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Alexander von Humboldt]], 1799\u20131804\n* [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]], 1817\u20131820\n* [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], 1848\u20131859\n\n=== Post-colonial exploitation and settlement ===\n[[File:Casaamazonica.jpg|thumb|[[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] state]]\n[[File:Centro de Manaus.jpg|thumb|[[Amazon Theatre]] opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom]]\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe [[Cabanagem]] revolt (1835\u20131840) was directed against the white ruling class.

The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Par\u00e1 (now Bel\u00e9m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man\u00e1os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500.

He organised the \"Companhia de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o e Com\u00e9rcio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the ''Monarca'' ('Monarch'), the ''Camet\u00e1'', the ''Maraj\u00f3'' and the ''Rio Negro''.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Sobre Escravos e Regat\u00f5es|url=http://www.snh2015.anpuh.org/resources/anais/39/1439329194_ARQUIVO_ANPUHSobreescravoseregatoes1.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2015|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par\u00e1 and Camet\u00e1.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur\u00fas and Negro; a third established a line between Par\u00e1 and Manaus; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}\n\nOn 31 July 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the [[upper Amazon]] basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga \u2013 on the Amazon; Camet\u00e1 \u2013 on the Tocantins; Santar\u00e9m \u2013 on the Tapaj\u00f3s; Borba \u2013 on the Madeira, and Manaus \u2013 on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}}\n\nThanks in part to the [[mercantile]] development associated with [[steamboat]] navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for [[natural rubber]], the Peruvian city of [[Iquitos]] became a thriving, cosmopolitan centre of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.<ref>Historia del Peru, Editorial Lexus. p. 93.</ref> During the [[rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as [[typhus]] and [[malaria]], killed 40,000 native Amazonians.<ref>La Republica Oligarchic.

Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company\u2014the Amazon Steam Navigation Company\u2014as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur\u00fas and many other tributaries,{{sfn|Church|1911|p=789}} such as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, to ports as distant as [[Nauta]], Peru.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were [[Natural rubber|India-rubber]], [[cacao bean]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of minor importance, such as [[Fur|pelts]] and exotic forest produce ([[resin]]s, barks, woven [[hammock]]s, prized bird [[feather]]s, live animals) and extracted goods, such as [[lumber]] and gold.\n\n=== 20th-century development ===\n[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Manaus]], the largest city in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the dark [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and the muddy Amazon River]]\n[[File:Sitio de la Victoria regia, Leticia.JPG|thumb|Floating houses in [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than {{convert|65|km2}}, excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.{{sfn|Church|1911|p=790}} This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia.

A large-scale colonization programme saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]] (''Transamaz\u00f4nica'').<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as [[BR-319]] (Manaus-[[Porto Velho]]), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Bras\u00edlia to Bel\u00e9m with the highway and National Integration Programme, however, the programme failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem.

Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin).  The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the [[International Scale of River Difficulty|class IV\u2013V]] nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections.  Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80&nbsp;km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80&nbsp;km longer than previously thought.

The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the ''Solim\u00f5es'' and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Per\u00fa. It has a series of major tributaries in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], some of which flow into the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River|Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]] and [[Ucayali]], and others directly into the Amazon proper.

If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u00e1 (state of Amap\u00e1) and Jurupari (state of Par\u00e1), the width falls to about {{convert|15|km|mi}}.\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Dispute regarding length ===\n[[File:Amazon River Taxi.jpg|thumb|River taxi in Peru]]\n{{see also|Coastline paradox}}\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or [[Nile|the Nile]] is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.

Fifteen million years ago, the main [[tectonic uplift]] phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] underneath the [[South American Plate]]. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and [[Guayana Shield|Guyana]] bedrock shields,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the freshwaters of the Amazon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the [[sandstone]] from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During [[glacial period]]s, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the world's largest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.<ref>{{cite journal|first= J. |last= Figueiredo |first2= C. |last2= Hoorn |first3= P. |last3= van der Ven |first4= E. |last4= Soares |title= Late Miocene onset of the Amazon River and the Amazon deep-sea fan: Evidence from the Foz do Amazonas Basin |journal= Geology |year= 2009 |volume= 37 |issue= 7 |pages= 619\u201322 |doi= 10.1130/g25567a.1 }}</ref>\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the [[Hamza River]], the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.<ref name=\"tv.ibtimes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ibtimes.com/massive-river-found-flowing-beneath-the-amazon/1753.html |title=Massive River Found Flowing Beneath the Amazon |accessdate=2011-09-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111110171150/http://tv.ibtimes.com/massive-river-found-flowing-beneath-the-amazon/1753.html |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n== Protected areas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!

([[floruit|fl.]] 1143), [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]], was [[sacristan]] of the church of [[Beverley]] in the first half of the twelfth century.\n\nHe wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a [[chronicle]] entitled ''Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae'', which begins with [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and carries the history of England down to 1129. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Simeon of Durham]] are Alfred's chief sources.{{sfn|Davis|1911}}\n\n==Biography==\nAlfred of Beverley, was a priest of Beverley, and is described in the preface to his book as \"treasurer of the church of Beverley\" and \"Master Alfred, sacrist of the church of Beverley\".{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}}\n\nAlfred of Beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the Flemings from the north of England to Ross in Herefordshire in 1112, and writes that he compiled his chronicle \"when the church was silent, owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of London\",{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}} an apparent reference to the council held at Mid-Lent, 1143. His attention, by his own account, was first drawn to history by the publication (before 1139) of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth's]] [[Historia Regum Britanniae]], and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name, and which largely depends on Geoffrey's work, with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the [[Historia Regum Britanniae]], but no trace of such a work is extant.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}}\n\nAlfred of Beverley's chronicle is entitled ''Aluredi Beverlacensis Annales sive Historia de gestis Regum Britanni\u00e6 libris ix. ad annum 1129''. It is largely devoted to the fabulous history of Britain, and is mainly borrowed from [[Venerable Bede|Bede]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Symeon of Durham]], when Geoffrey of Monmouth is not laid under contribution. Alfred quotes occasionally from [[Suetonius]], [[Orosius]], and [[Nennius]], and names many Roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for references to Britain. The chronicle is of no real use to the historical student, since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well-known earlier authorities.{{sfn|Lee|1885|p=258}}\n\nAccording to Sidney Lee (1885) the best manuscript of Alfred's ''Annales'' was among the Hengwrt MSS. belonging to W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., of Peniarth, Merionethshire, and had not been printed. Hearne printed the \u2018Annales\u2019 in 1716 from an inferior Bodleian MS. (Rawl.

One of his early titles, preceding his conversion to [[Islam]], was ''atiqe'', \"the saved one\". Muhammad later reaffirmed this title when he said that Abu Bakr is the \"atiqe\" (the one saved from hell fire by God).<ref>Abi Na'eem, \"Ma'arifat al-sahaba\", no. 60</ref> He was called ''Al-Siddiq'' (the truthful)<ref name=\"Campo\"/> by Muhammad after he believed him in the event of [[Isra and Mi'raj]] when other people didn't, and [[Ali]] confirmed that title several times.<ref>Abi Na'eem, \"Ma'arifat al-sahaba\", no. 64, 65</ref>\n\nThere is a dispute over his name being Abdullah.

After the death of Abu Bakr, her brother [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr|Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] was raised by Ali. After Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Umayyads, Aisha raised and taught her nephew [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr|al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]]. Aisha also taught another nephew [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]]. He then taught his son [[Hisham ibn Urwah]], who was the main teacher of [[Malik ibn Anas]] whose views many Sunni follow.\n\nQasim's mother was of \u2018Ali's family and his daughter [[Farwah bint al-Qasim]], who married [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq.

Muhammad, who was 12 years old at the time, was also with the caravan. In 591 at the age of 18, Abu Bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant, which was the family's business. In the coming years Abu Bakr traveled extensively with caravans. Business trips took him to [[Yemen]], Syria, and elsewhere. These travels brought him wealth and added to his experience. His business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance. Though his father, Uthman Abu Quhafa, was still alive, he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe.\n\nLike other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for [[Arabic poetry|poetry]]. He used to attend the annual fair at [[Sha'ir|Ukaz]], and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the [[genealogy]] of the Arab tribes, their stories and their [[politics]].<ref>Al-zarkali, \"al-a'alam\", dar al'ilm lil'malayeen, 15th edition, May 2002</ref>\n\nA story is preserved that once when he was a child, his father took him to the [[Kaaba]], and asked him to pray before the [[Idolatry|idols]]. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said \"O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me\". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol saying \"O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry\". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and addressing an idol said \"Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself\". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the [[Kaaba]]. Thereafter, he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols.<ref>SIDIQ-I-AKBAR HAZRAT ABU BAKR by PROF. MASUD-UL-HASAN PAGE 2. Printed and published by A.

Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Abu Bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, but not by the entire Quraysh tribe.\n\n==Last years in Mecca==\nIn 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the [[Banu Hashim]]. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from [[Mecca]]. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment. Before it many Muslims migrated to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.\n\nIn 620, Muhammad's uncle and protector, [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], and Muhammad's wife [[Khadija]] died. Abu Bakr's daughter [[Aisha]] was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj]] (Night Journey).<ref>''Islam (Exploring Religions)'' by Anne Geldart, published by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann Library]], 28 September 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-431-09301-7}}</ref>\n\n==Migration to Medina==\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)}}\n[[File:The outline of history - being a plain history of life and mankind (1920) (14580517757).jpg|right|thumb|[[Muhammad]] and Abu Bakr flee [[Mecca]], as depicted in ''[[The Outline of History]]'' ]]\n\nIn 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of [[Medina]], Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh led by Ikrima attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad in his migration for Medina. Due to the danger of the Quraysh, they did not take the road to Medina. They moved in the opposite direction, and took refuge in a cave in [[Jabal Thawr]] some five miles south of Mecca. [[`Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr]], the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and talks of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. [[Asma bint Abi Bakr]], the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day.<ref>''Islamic Culture'' by the Islamic Cultural Board Published 1927 s.n. Original from the University of Michigan, digitized 27 March 2006.</ref> Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to sight them. Due to this, [[Qur'an]] verse {{cite quran|9|40 |s=ns |b=n}} was revealed. [[Aisha]], [[Abu Sa\u2018id al-Khudri]] and [[Abdullah ibn Abbas]] in [[Tafsir|interpreting]] this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave.\n\nAfter staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to [[Medina]], staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina. While [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sources portray Abu Bakr in an exalted light in the cave.\n===Life in Medina===\nIn Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a [[mosque]]. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. Muslims constructed a mosque named [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] at the site and Abu Bakr also took part in construction. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brother in faith]]. Abu Bakr's relationship with Khaarjah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah.\n\nKhaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammad's.<ref>[[Hazrat]] ''Abu Bakr, the First Caliph of Islam'' by Muhammad Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani, published 1963 Sh. Muhammad Ashraf. Original from the University of Michigan. Digitized 14 November 2006.</ref>\n\nThe climate of Mecca was dry, but the climate of Medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthened the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.<ref name=\"Maghazi\"/>\n\n==Military campaigns under Muhammad==\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Sunni Islam|Rightly Guided Caliphs}}\n\n===Battles of Badr and Uhud===\n{{Main|Battle of Badr|Battle of Uhud}}\nIn 624 Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the [[Battle of Badr]], but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In 625 he participated in the [[Battle of Uhud]] that ended resultless but the Muslims suffered heavy loss of lives. Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]], who was still non-Muslim and fighting from the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. His son later converted to [[Islam]] and gained fame during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] as a fierce warrior. In the second phase of the battle, [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]\u2019s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, causing dozens of casualties to the Muslim that changed the course of the war. Many Muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war. Ali ibn Abi Talib, and a few other Muslims remained guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, majority of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and many Sunni Hadith agree to this. \n\nIn Sunni accounts during one such attack(not uhad), two discs from Abu Bakr's shield penetrated into Muhammad's cheeks. Abu Bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two [[incisor]]s during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety.<ref name=\"Maghazi\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Jewish tribes===\n{{Main|Invasion of Banu Nadir|Invasion of Banu Qurayza}}\nLater in the year Abu Bakr was a part of campaign against the [[Jew]]ish tribe of [[Banu Nadir]].\n\n===Battle of the Trench===\n{{main|Battle of the Trench}}\nIn 627 he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the [[Invasion of Banu Qurayza]].<ref name=\"Maghazi\"/> In this battle, Muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector. One of such contingents was under the command of Abu Bakr. The enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch. All such assaults were repulsed. Abu Bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector. To commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where Abu Bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy. The mosque was later known as 'Masjid-i-Siddiq'.<ref>SIDIQ-I-AKBAR HAZRAT ABU BAKR by PROF. MASUD-UL-HASAN page 36 Published and Printed by A.

Khaybar had eight fortresses; the strongest and most well-guarded fortress was called Al-Qamus. Muhammad sent Abu Bakr with a group of warriors to attempt to conquer the fortress; however, Abu Bakr was unsuccessful in capturing the fortress. Muhammad also sent Umar with a group of warriors, but Umar could not conquer Al-Qamus either.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims |page=192}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ibn Ishaq |title=The Life of the Messenger of God}}</ref><ref name=\"The Life of Mohammed\">{{cite book |last1=Irving |first1=Washington |title=The Life of Mohammed}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Haykal |first1=Muhammad Husayn |title=The Life of Muhammad |date=1935 |location=Cairo |quote=As the days went by, the Prophet sent Abu Bakr with a contingent and a flag to the fortress of Na'im; but he was not able to conquer it despite heavy fighting.

Commanding an army under him were Abu Bakr and [[Umar]] and they attacked and defeated the enemy.<ref>Sahih-al-Bhukari book of Maghazi, Ghazwa Saif-al-Jara</ref>\n\nIn 630 when Muslim armies rushed for the [[Conquest of Mecca]], Abu Bakr was a part of the army. Before the conquest of Mecca his father [[Uthman Abu Quhafa]] converted to Islam.\n\n===Battle of Hunayn and Ta'if===\nIn 630 he was part of [[Battle of Hunayn]] and [[Siege of Ta'if]]. In the Battle of Hunayn as the Muslim army passed through the valley of Hunayn some eleven miles north east of [[Mecca]] a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass. Taken unaware the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover. Muhammad stood firm. There were only nine companions around him including Abu Bakr. All the rest had fled. Under the instructions of Muhammad, Abbas shouted at the top of his voice \"O Muslims come to the Prophet of Allah\". The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslim had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to [[Autas]].\n\nMuhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to Ta'if.\n\nAbu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if. From Autas the Muslim forces set out for Ta'if. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town, but this did not lead to any tangible results. The Muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. The enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective.\n\nThe siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God would Himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in February 630, the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to [[Mecca]]. A few days later Malik bin Auf the commander, came to [[Mecca]] and became a Muslim. Thus the forecast of Abu Bakr came to be fulfilled, and the God Himself arranged for the surrender of Ta'if.<ref>SIDIQ-I-AKBAR HAZRAT ABU BAKR by PROF. MASUD-UL-HASAN page 46 Printed and Published by A. SALAM, FEROZSONS Ltd 60, Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore</ref>\n\n===Expedition of Tabuk===\nIn 630 AD Muhammad decided to lead an expedition to [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]] on the [[Syrian]] border. In order to finance the expedition Muhammad invited contributions and donations from his followers. [[Uthman]] provided ten thousand camels. [[Umar]] made a liberal contribution. When Muhammad asked him how much he had left for himself and his family he said that he has given one half of his wealth for the cause of God and had left one half for himself and his dependents. Then Abu Bakr came loaded with his contribution and Muhammad put him the same question as to how much wealth he had for himself and his family. Abu Bakr said \"I have brought all that I had. I have left Allah and His Prophet for myself and my family\". This episode has formed the theme of one of the poems of [[Allama Iqbal]]. The last verse of this poem reads:\n\n{{quote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|For the moth the lamp, and for the nightingale the flower\nFor Siddiq God and His Prophet Suffice.}}\n\nThe call to arms was given at a very critical period. The weather was burning hot. Crops were ripe and ready for harvesting. The journey was long and arduous. Many persons preferred to stay back. In spite of these obstacles and difficulties, an army of thirty thousand persons was raised. The army assembled at Al Jorf outside [[Medina]]. Muhammad remained at Medina for some time to attend to other affairs, and at Al Jorf Abu Bakr deputised for Muhammad and led the prayers.\n\nThe Muslim army reached Tabuk after a weary march. At Tabuk the standard of the army was entrusted to Abu Bakr. There were no [[Byzantine]] forces to meet the Muslims. On coming to know of the advance of the Muslim army the Byzantines had withdrawn their army well within [[Syria]]. The Muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot. The Byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade [[Arabia]] were no longer in the mood to measure swords with the Muslims.<ref>SIDIQ-I-AKBAR HAZRAT ABU BAKR by PROF. MASUD-UL-HASAN PAGE 47, 48</ref>\n\n===Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj===\nIn 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the [[Hajj]] according to the new Islamic way. Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates. The day after Abu Bakr and his party had left for Hajj, Muhammad received a new revelation: Surah Tawbah, the ninth chapter of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims |page=255}}</ref> It is related that when this revelation came, someone suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=ibn Ishaq |first1=Muhammad |title=The Life of the Messenger of God}}</ref>\n\nMuhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim a portion of Surah Tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]]. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.\n\nAt Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:\n\n#Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the [[Kaaba]] or perform the pilgrimage.\n#No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked.\n#[[Polytheism]] was not to be tolerated. Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods. Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists.\n\nFrom the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in [[Arabia]]. Henceforward Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.\n\n===Military campaigns as commander===\n{{Main|Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq}}\nAbu Bakr also led one military campaign as commander, known as [[Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq]],<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZmBkoDa9fcC&pg=PA205 |title=Atlas Al-s\u012brah Al-Nabaw\u012byah |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Darussalam |via=Google Books}}</ref> which took place in [[Najd|Nejd]], in July 628 AD (3rd Month 7AH in the [[Islamic calendar]]).<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Abu Bakr led a large platoon in Nejd on the order of Muhammad.

It is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where Muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what; for other battles, if someone was unable to go to the fight, Muhammad would let them stay at home.\n\n==Election of Abu Bakr as Caliph==\n[[Image:Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak 634-mohammad adil rais.PNG|thumb|300px|Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak in August 634.]]\n{{Main|Succession to Muhammad|Hadith of the pond of Khumm|List of Sahaba not giving bay'ah to Abu Bakr}}\nAfter Muhammad's death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan [[Immigration|immigrants]], the [[Muhajirun]], and the Medinan converts, the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], threatened to break out and split the [[Ummah]]. Other Arabic tribes also wished to revert to local leadership and split from Medina's control. In some places, people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose Medina, e.g. [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]] and [[Musaylimah]]. All of which are events that led to splitting the Muslim community.<ref name=\"Donner\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBzRj7OajmEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Fred M.

When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, [[Umar]], [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first Muslim [[caliph]], and the first Muslim given the title ''Khalifa-tul-Rasul'' (''Successor of messenger of Allah''), a title accepted by Sunni Muslims.\n\n[[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] believe that Abu Bakr is the rightful Caliph. The [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and the [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] Shia believe that [[Ali]] should have been the first Caliph. Their main argument is based on their interpretation of [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Reign as a Caliph==\nAfter assuming the office of [[Caliphate]] Abu Bakr's first address was as follows:\n\n{{quote|I have been given the authority over you, and I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right. Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery. The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger. But if I disobey God and His Messenger, you owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, God have mercy upon you. (Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah 6:305,306)}}.\n\nAbu Bakr's Caliphate lasted for 27 months, during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in the successful [[Ridda Wars]]. In the last months of his rule, he sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests [[Muslim conquest of Persia|against the Sassanid Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|against the Byzantine Empire]] in [[Syria]]. This would set in motion a historical trajectory<ref name=\"Donner\" /> (continued later on by [[Umar]] and [[Uthman ibn Affan]]) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.\n\n===Preservation of the Qur'an===\n{{Main|Origin and development of the Qur'an}}\n[[File:20131203 Istanbul 091.jpg|thumb|[[Calligraphic]] representation of ''Abu Bakr'' in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].]]\nAccording to [[Sunni Islam]], Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the ''Qur'an'' in written form.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an|last=Shaheeh International|first=|publisher=Al-Muntada Al-Islami Trust|year=2010|isbn=9786039016946|location=London, England|pages=930\u2013931}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/838559683|title=The Qur'an|date=2010|publisher=Al-Muntada Al-Islami Trust|others=Saheeh International., Muntad\u00e1 al-Isl\u0101m\u012b (London, England)|isbn=9786039016946|location=[London, England]|oclc=838559683}}</ref> It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later Caliph Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the ''Qur'an'' (about 300 to 700) had died in battle. Fearing that the Qur'an may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] which included the memorizers of the ''Qur'an'' and Umar and to collect all verses of the book. After collecting all Qur'anic verses from texts in the possession of various sahaba, Zayd ibn Thabit and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the ''Qur'an''. After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the Caliph Abu Bakr. It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his sahaba (companions) were still alive.\n\nTwelver Shi'ites reject the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quran compiled by Imam Ali (AS) |work=Al-Islam.org |url=http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter8/4.html |accessdate=12 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover. He developed high [[fever]] and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Realizing his death was near, he sent for [[Ali]] and requested him to perform his [[ghusl]] since Ali had also done it for Muhammad.\n\nAbu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed.<ref>''Sidiq-i-Akbar Hazrat Abu Bakr'' by Masudul Hasan. Lahore: Ferozsons, 1976. {{OCLC|3478821}}</ref>\n\nHe appointed Umar as his successor after discussing with some companions. Some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.\n\nAbu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to [[Uthman ibn Affan]] as follows:\n\n{{Quote|In the name of Most Merciful God. This is the last will and testament of Abu Bakr bin Abu Quhafa, when he is in the last hour of the world, and the first of the next; an hour in which the infidel must believe, the wicked be convinced of their evil ways, I nominate Umar bin al Khattab as my successor.

He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/fatima-the-gracious-abu-muhammad-ordoni/abu-bakr-versus-fatima-az-zahra-sa al-islam.org], ''Fatima the Gracious'', by Abu - Muhammad Ordoni, 1987.  Section entitled ''Abu Bakr Versus Fatima az-Zahra (sa)''.<br>See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 5, Book 57, Number 60, which says: \"Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, \"Allah's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah's Apostle used to do,\" Then 'Ali said, \"I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,\" and added, \"O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.\" Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, \"By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah's Apostle rather than to my own relatives\" Abu Bakr added: Look at Muhammad through his family.\"\n<br>See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 8, Book 80, Number 722, which says:  \"Aisha said, 'When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.' Then \"Aisha said to them, 'Didn't Allah's Apostle say, Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'\"</ref> However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book ''A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims'', Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims |pages=34\u201335 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Twelver Shia accuse him of participating in [[Umar at Fatimah's house|the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima]].<ref>Ibn Qutayba al Dinawari.

He is honored as a saint by the [[Camaldolese]] Order.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Traversari]] was born near [[Forl\u00ec]], at the village of [[Portico e San Benedetto|Portico di Romagna]] in 1386.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  At the age of fourteen he entered the [[Camaldolese]] Order in the Monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|St. Mary of the Angels]] in [[Florence]], and rapidly became a leading theologian and [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenist]]. In his study of [[Greek literature]] his master was [[Manuel Chrysoloras|Emmanuel Chrysoloras]]. He worked primarily as a scholar until he became [[Prior]] General of the Order in 1431.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAmbrose emerged as a leading advocate of the [[papal primacy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] as legate of [[Pope Eugene IV]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and defended the primacy of the Pope and adjured the council not to \"rend asunder [[Jesus|Christ's]] seamless robe\".{{sfn|Becket|1913}} He was next sent by the [[Pope]] to the Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to ask his aid in the pope's efforts to end this Council, which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives. The Pope transferred the Council from [[Basel]] to [[Ferrara]] on 18 September 1437.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}\n\nSo strong was Ambrose's hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]. He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} But in this Council, and later, in that of Florence, Ambrose, by his efforts and charity toward some poor Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to draw up.\n\nHe died soon after.{{sfn|Becket|1913}} His [[calendar of saints|feastday]] is celebrated by the Camaldolese Order on 20 November.\n\n==Character==\nAccording to the author of his biography in the Eleventh edition of the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': \"Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as [[Cosimo de' Medici]], he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Works==\nHis works include a treatise on the Holy [[Eucharist]], one on the [[Trinity (Christianity)#Eternal generation and procession|Procession of the Holy Spirit]], many lives of saints, as well as a history of his term as Prior General of the Camaldolese. He also translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] a life of Saint [[John Chrysostom]] ([[Venice]], 1533); the Spiritual Wisdom of [[Joannes Moschus|John Moschus]]; ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of Saint [[John Climacus]] (Venice, 1531), P.G., LXXXVIII.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}  Between 1424 and 1433 he worked on the translation of the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' by [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], which came to be widely circulated in manuscript form and was published at [[Rome]] in 1472 (the first printed edition of the ''Lives''; the Greek text was printed only in 1533).{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} He also translated four books against the errors of the Greeks, by [[Manuel Kalekas]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] ([[Ingolstadt]], 1608), P.G., CLII, col. 13-661, a work known only through Ambrose's translation.\n\nHe also translated many homilies of Saint John Chrysostom; the treatise of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] on the celestial hierarchy; [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil's]] treatise on [[virginity]]; thirty nine discourses of St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]], and many other works of the [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]] and writers of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]].

Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: ''De virginibus'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'', ''De institutione virginis'', ''De exhortatione virginitatis'', and ''De lapsu virginis consecratae''. Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Ambrosians|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\nIt is against this background that two religious orders or congregations\u2014one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries\u2014took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Order of St Ambrose===\nThe first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some  priests. In 1375 [[Pope Gregory XI]] gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name \"Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus\" and adopted a habit consisting of a brown [[tunic]], [[scapular]], and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of [[prior]] who was then instituted by the [[Archbishop of Milan]]. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In 1441 [[Pope Eugene IV]] merged them into one congregation called \"Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus\", made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two \"visitors\".<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nSaint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. In 1589 [[Pope Sixtus V]] united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the \"Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life\" (or  \"Apostolini\" or \"Brothers of St. Barnabas\"), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union  was confirmed by [[Pope Paul V]] in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by [[Pope Innocent X]] in 1650.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Nuns===\nThe Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]], but were independent in government. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life.  Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nAnother group of cloistered \"Nuns of St Ambrose\", also called the Annunciatae (Italian: ''Annunziate'') of Lombardy or \"Sisters of St Marcellina\", were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint [[Catharine Fieschi Adorno]], who died on September 14, 1510.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles===\n{{Main|Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles}}\nIn some sense also \"Ambrosians\" are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St [[Charles Borromeo]], Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of \"Priests of Peace\". In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of \"Oblates of St. Ambrose.\" They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by [[Napoleon I]] in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of \"Oblates of St. Charles\" and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the \"Oblates of St Charles\", established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[St. Ambrose University]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Anabaptism]]\n[[Category:Baptism]]\n[[Category:Premillennialism]]", "sha1": "24z6qjvx2aqywrp88qvhn8m07c1kbxr"}}, {"title": "Ambrosiaster", "ns": "0", "id": "1718", "revision": {"id": "863923559", "parentid": "857102678", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T00:01:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Studies */[[WP:GenFixes]] on, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: r\u2019s \u2192 r's", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "__NOTOC__\n'''Ambrosiaster''' is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] epistles, \"brief in words but weighty in matter,\" and valuable for the criticism of the [[Latin]] text of the [[New Testament]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ambrosiaster|volume=1|page=801}}</ref> The commentary itself was written during the papacy of [[Pope Damasus I]], that is, between 366 and 384, and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the [[Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]], and of the interpretation of Paul prior to [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"OCD\"/>\n\nThis commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St [[Ambrose]].

Because [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] cites Ambrosiaster's commentary on Romans 5.12 under the name of \"Hilary\", many critics have attempted to identify Ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named \"Hilary\" active in the period. In 1899, [[Germain Morin]] suggested that the writer was Isaac,<ref>''Rev. d'hist. et de litt. religieuses'', tom. iv. 97 f.</ref> a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to [[Spain]] in 378-380 and then relapsed to [[Judaism]]; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of [[Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius]], proconsul of [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Africa]] in 377.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Alternatively, [[Paolo Angelo Ballerini]] attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to Ambrose, in his complete edition of that Father's work. This is extremely problematic, though, since it would require Ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop, and then added to it in later years, incorporating later remarks of [[Hilary of Poitiers]] on Romans.<ref>[[Alexander Souter]], ''Study of Ambrosiaster'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1905)</ref> No identifications, therefore, have acquired lasting popularity with scholars, and his identity remains a mystery.\n\nSeveral other minor works have been attributed to this same author, along with a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates, the ''Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti,'' which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In 1905, Alexander Souter established that this work should also be attributed to Ambrosiaster.<ref name=\"OCD\"/><ref name=\"David G Hunter 2010 p307\">David G Hunter, \"Fourth-century Latin writers\", in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p307</ref> Fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to Ambrosiaster: a commentary on Matthew 24, a discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which a woman placed yeast, and a treatment of Peter's denial and the arrest of Jesus in Gethsemane.

Internal evidence suggests he was active at Rome during the reign of Pope Damasus (366\u2013384), and almost certainly a member of the Roman clergy. There are strong indications he objected to Jerome's efforts to revise the Old Latin versions of the Gospels, and that he was critical of Jerome's activity among ascetic women at Rome. Ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in Judaism and often notes that Christian practices derive from Jewish tradition.<ref>David G Hunter, \"Fourth-century Latin writers\", in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p308</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Texts===\n* Heinrich Joseph Vogels, Vinzenz Bulhart, and Rudolf Hanslik. 1966.

He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. Eventually he was transformed into the uncle of [[King Arthur]], the brother of Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], and predeceases them both.\n\nDue to Gildas' description of him, Ambrosius is one of the figures called the [[Last of the Romans]].<ref name=\"Venning\">Venning (2013), Ambrosius Aurelianus, unnumbered pages</ref>\n\n==According to Gildas==\nAmbrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people that [[Gildas]] identifies by name in his sermon ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', and the only one named from the 5th century.<ref name=\"Fletcher_15\">{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=15\u201316|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn| isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''De Excidio'' is considered the oldest extant British document about the so-called Arthurian period of [[Sub-Roman Britain]].<ref name=\"Reno\">Reno (1996), p. 263\u2013282</ref> Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:\n\n{{quote|a gentleman who, perhaps alone of the Romans, had survived the shock of this notable storm.

The Lord assented, and the battle went their way.<ref name=\"Korrel\">Korrel (1984), pp. 5\u201330</ref>}}\n\nSome basic information on Ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage: Ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a [[Christian]] (Gildas says that he won his battles \"with [[God]]'s help\").<ref name=\"Fletcher_15\" /> Ambrosius' parents were slain by the Saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/>\n\nAccording to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: \"Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious.\"\n\n===Two questions===\nTwo points in Gildas' description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius' family \"had worn the purple\". [[Roman emperor]]s and male [[patrician (Ancient Rome)|Patricians]] wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage. [[Tribune#Tribune of the soldiers|Roman military tribunes]] (''tribuni militum''), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership. The tradition was old as the [[toga]]s and [[pallium (Roman cloak)|pallia]] of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band. In the church \"the purple\" is a euphemism for blood and therefore \"wearing the purple\" may be a reference to martyrdom<ref name=\"Gidlow_80\">{{cite book |last= Gidlow|first= Christopher|title= The Reign of Arthur: From History to Legend|pages=80|year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing| isbn = 0-7509-3418-2 }}</ref><ref name=\"Craughwell\">Craughwell (2008), pp. 106\u2013112</ref> or a bishop's robe. In addition, in the later [[Roman Empire]] both [[Roman consul]]s and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe. The ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a Roman catalogue of official posts, lists four or five provincial governors in [[Roman Britain]] and two of them were of consular rank. One was the governor of [[Maxima Caesariensis]] and the other that of [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]. The parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors, whose names were not recorded.<ref name=\"Ashley\">Ashley (2005), ''De Excidio'', unnumbered pages</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested by historian Alex Woolf that Ambrosius may have been related to the 5th century Romano-British usurpers [[Marcus (usurper)|Marcus]] or [[Gratian (usurper)|Gratian]] \u2013 Woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for Marcus.<ref name=\"Woolf_354\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Woolf |first=Alex |editor1-last=Goetz |editor1-first=Hans-Werner|editor2-last=Jarnut |editor2-first=Jorg |editor3-last=Pohl |editor3-first=Walter |encyclopedia=Regna and Gentes: The relationship between Late Antique and Early Medieval Peoples and Kingdoms in the Transformation of the Roman World |title=The Britons: from Romans to Barbarians |date=2003 |publisher=BRILL |series=The Transformation of the Roman World |volume=13 |isbn=9004125248 |pages=345\u201380}}</ref> Frank D. Reno, an Arthurian scholar, has instead argued that the name \"Aurelianus\" indicates the possible descent of Ambrosius from the [[List of Roman emperors|Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian|Lucius Domitius Aurelianus]] (Aurelian, reigned 270\u2013275).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}<!-- possibly <ref name=\"Reno\"/> ? --> Aurelian's military campaigns included the conquest of the [[Gallic Empire]]. N. J. Higham suggests that Ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late [[Roman Empire]], such as the [[Theodosian dynasty]]. Branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western Roman provinces like [[Hispania]].<ref name=\"Higham\">Higham (1994), p. 35\u201366</ref>\n\n[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] instead focuses on the name \"Ambrosius\". In his view, it seems to suggest connection to [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrosius]], a fourth-century [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]], who also served as consular governor in areas of [[Roman Italy]]. The father of the Bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Praetorian prefect of Gaul]] named Aurelius Ambrosius, whose areas included Britain, though some modern scholars doubt that Saint Ambrosius was related to this man (instead identifying his father with an official named Uranius mentioned in an extract from the [[Theodosian Code]]).<ref>Barnes, T. D., \"The Election of Ambrose of Milan\", in: Johan Leemans (ed), ''Episcopal Elections in Late Antiquity'', de Gruyter, 2011, pp 39\u201360.</ref><ref>Mazzarino, S. \"Il padre di Ambrogio\", ''Helikon'' 13\u201314, 1973\u20131974, 111\u2013117.</ref><ref>Mazzarino, S., \"Storia sociale del vescovo Ambrogio\", ''Problemi e ricerche di storia antica'' 4, Rome 1989, 79\u201381.</ref> Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii.<ref name=\"Ashley\"/> Tim Venning points out that the name \"Aurelianus\" could be the result of a [[Adoption in ancient Rome|Roman adoption]]. When a boy was adopted into a new [[gens]] (clan), he received the family names of his new family, plus an additional [[cognomen]] indicating his descent from his original gens/family. The additional cognomen often had the form \"-anus\". When [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] from gens [[Octavia (gens)|Octavia]] was adopted into the [[Julii Caesares]] family, his new name became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.<ref name=\"Venning\"/> In this case, Ambrosius may have been a member of gens [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelia]] who was adopted by another gens/family. His original name Aurelius became Aurelianus.<ref name=\"Venning\"/>\n\nThe second question is the meaning of the word ''avita'': Gildas could have meant \"ancestors\", or intended it to mean more specifically \"grandfather\" \u2013 thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the [[Battle of Badon]]. Lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions.\n\n===Gildas' motives===\nN. J. Higham wrote a book on Gildas and the literary tropes that he used. He has suggested that Gildas may have had considerable motives for placing attention to Ambrosius. He was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man, according to Higham, but setting him as an example to his contemporaries. It was essential to the philosophy of Gildas that Briton leaders who achieved victory over the [[barbarian]]s were only able to do so because of divine aid. And only those who had superior Christian virtues were deserving of this aid.<ref name=\"Higham\"/> Ambrosius Aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians. In order to fit him in his worldview, Gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptional virtues and obedience to God. He was made to fit Gildas' version of a model leader.<ref name=\"Higham\"/>\n\nHigham also suggests that the Roman lineage of Ambrosius was highlighted for a reason. Gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the Romans. He was also contrasting him with the subsequent Briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy.<ref name=\"Higham\"/>\n\n===Identifying historical figures===\nGildas is a primary source for the [[Battle of Badon]], yet he never mentions the names of the combatants. Therefore, we cannot know if Ambrosius Aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> The names of the Saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded.\n\nThe identities of Ambrosius' descendants are unknown, since Gildas never identifies them by name. It is safe to assume that they were Gildas' contemporaries and known to the author.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> Higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time. Their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named.<ref name=\"Higham\"/> The work portrays Ambrosius' descendants as inferior to their ancestor as part of his criticism on rulers of his time, according to Higham. Those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them, but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor.<ref name=\"Higham\"/>\n\nMike Ashley suggests that the descendants of Ambrosius could include other people named by Gildas. He favors the inclusion in this category of one [[Aurelius Conanus|Aurelius Caninus]] (\"Aurelius the little dog\" or \"Aurelius the whelp\"), whom Gildas accuses of [[parricide]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], and warmongering. His name \"Aurelius\" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname \"Caninus\" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named [[Conan (disambiguation)|Conan]]/[[Cynan]]/[[Kenan (name)|Kenan]]. Some identify him with [[Cynan Garwyn]], a 6th-century [[Kingdom of Powys|King of Powys]], though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him.<ref name=\"Ashley\"/> Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in [[Brittany]]. Caninus, in this view, might be [[Conomor]] (\"Great Dog\"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from [[Domnon\u00e9e]], an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from [[Dumnonia]]. He might be remembered in British legend as [[Mark of Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Ashley\"/>\n\nGildas primarily features the Saxons as barbarian raiders; their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest. By AD 500, possibly the time described by Gildas, [[Anglo-Saxons]] controlled the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], and coastal areas of [[Northumberland]] and [[Yorkshire]]. The rest of the former [[Roman Britain]] was still under the control of the local Britons.<ref name=\"Craughwell\"/> Gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably reflects historical facts. [[Londinium]], once a major city, was completely abandoned during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Craughwell\"/><ref name=\"Ashley\"/>\n\n==According to Bede==\n[[Bede]] follows Gildas' account of Ambrosius in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'',<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> but in his ''Chronica Majora'' he dates Ambrosius' victory to the reign of the [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] (474\u2013491).\n\nBede's treatment of the 5th century history of Great Britain is not particularly valuable as a source. Until about the year 418, Bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of [[Orosius]]. Following the end of Orosius' history, Bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on Gildas. Entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of Gildas' account with mostly stylistic changes.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> Bede's account of Ambrosius Aurelianus has been translated as following:\n\n{{quote|When the army of the enemy had exterminated or scattered the native peoples, they returned home and the Britons slowly began to recover strength and courage. They emerged from their hiding-places and with one accord they prayed for the help of God that they might not be completely annihilated. Their leader at that time was a certain Ambrosius Aurelianus, a discreet man, who was, as it happened, the sole member of the Roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents, who bore a royal and famous name, had perished. Under his leadership the Britons regained their strength, challenged their victors to battle, and, with God's help, won the day.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/>}}\n\nBede does not mention the descendants of Ambrosius Aurelianus, nor their supposed degeneracy.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/>\n\n==According to Nennius==\nThe ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', attributed to [[Nennius]],<ref name=\"Reno\"/> preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. Despite the traditional attribution, the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians. There are several extant manuscript versions of the work, varying in details. The most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century. Some modern scholars think it unlikely that the work was composed by a single writer or compiler, suggesting that it may have taken centuries to reach its final form,<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> though this theory is not conclusive.\n\nIn Chapter 31, we are told that [[Vortigern]] ruled in fear of Ambrosius. This is the first mention of Ambrosius in the work. According to Frank D. Reno, this would indicate that Ambrosius' influence was formidable, since Vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore Roman rule in Britain.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> The chapter relates events following the end of Roman rule in Britain and preceding Vortigern's alliance with the Saxons.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nThe most significant appearance of Ambrosius is the story about Ambrosius, Vortigern, and the two [[dragon]]s beneath [[Dinas Emrys]], \"Fortress of Ambrosius\" in Chapters 40\u201342.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> In this account, Ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers. He intimidates Vortigern and the royal [[Magician (fantasy)|magicians]]. When it is revealed that Ambrosius is the son of a [[Roman consul]], Vortigern is convinced to [[Cession|cede]] to the younger man the castle of Dinas Emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of Britain. Vortigern then retreats to the north, in an area called Gwynessi.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> This story was later retold with more detail by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of [[Merlin|Myrddin]] the visionary, known for [[Oracle|oracular]] utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native [[Celt]]ic inhabitants of Britain over the [[Saxons]] and the [[Normans]]. Geoffrey also introduces him into the ''Historia'' under the name Aurelius Ambrosius as one of three sons of [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]], along with [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] and [[Uther Pendragon]].\n\nIn Chapter 48, Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as \"[[Kings of the Britons|king among all the kings of the British nation]]\". The chapter records that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the regions of [[Buellt]] and [[Gwrtheyrnion]] by Ambrosius.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> Finally, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a [[Battle of Guoloph]] (often identified with [[Middle Wallop|Wallop]], {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} ESE of [[Amesbury]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]]), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus. The author dates this battle as taking place 12 years from the reign of Vortigern.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nIt is not clear how these various traditions about Ambrosius relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. Frank D. Reno points out that the works call all these men \"Ambrosius\"/\"Emrys\". The [[cognomen]] \"Aurelianus\" is never used.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' dates the battle of Guoloph to \"the twelfth year of Vortigern\", by which the year 437 seems to be meant.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas says was commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus.\n\nThe text never identifies who Ambrosius's father is, just gives his title as a Roman consul. When an adolescent Ambrosius speaks of his father, there is no suggestion that this father is deceased. The boy is not identified as an orphan.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> The exact age of Ambrosius is not given in his one encounter with Vortigern. Frank D. Reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old, barely a teenager.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nIt is impossible to know to what degree Ambrosius actually wielded political power, and over what area. Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown as being in conflict in the ''Historia Brittonum'', and some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius and the other by Vortigern. [[J. N. L. Myres]] built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in [[Pelagianism]] reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] one. Subsequent historians accepted Myers' speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the ''Historia Brittonum'' is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the ''Historia Brittonum'', which include his alleged practice of [[incest]].<ref>As argued by Nora K. Chadwick, \"A Note on the Name Vortigern\" in ''Studies in Early British History'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1954), p. 41</ref>\n\nThe identity is somewhat obscure of Ambrosius' last mentioned enemy Vitalinus. Various manuscripts of the ''Historia'' and translations render his name \"Guitolin\", \"Guitolini\", \"Guitholini\", and \"Vitalinus\". He is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of [[Gloiu]] and co-founder of the city of [[Gloucester]]. No other background information is given.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> There are theories that Gloiu is also the father of Vortigern, but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found. There have been further attempts to identify Vitalinus with a pro-Vortigern or anti-Roman faction in Britain, opposed to the rise of the Romano-British Ambrosius. However, this is rendered problematic since Vitalinus seems to also have a Romano-British name. The traditional view of pro-Roman and pro-Briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\n==According to William of Malmesbury==\n\nAmbrosius appears briefly in the ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]'' (\"Deeds of the Kings of the English\") by [[William of Malmesbury]]. Despite its name, the work attempted to reconstruct British history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and various chroniclers.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> The work features Ambrosius as the apparent employer of [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. The relative passage has been translated as following:\n\n{{quote|On the death of [[Vortimer]], the strength of the Britons grew faint, their diminished hopes went backwards; and straight-way they would have come to ruin, had not Ambrosius, the sole survivor of the Romans, who was monarch of the realm after [[Vortigern]], repressed the overweening [[barbarian]]s through the distinguished achievements of the warlike Arthur.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/>}}\n\nWilliam swiftly shifts attention from Ambrosius to Arthur, and proceeds to narrate Arthur's supposed victory in the [[Battle of Badon]].<ref name=\"Korrel\"/> The narrative is probably the first to connect Ambrosius and Arthur. William had to reconcile the accounts of Gildas and Bede who implied that Ambrosius was connected to the battle, and that of Nennius which clearly stated that it was Arthur who was connected to the battle. He solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it. Ambrosius as the king of the Britons and Arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle.<ref name=\"Korrel\"/>\n\n==According to Geoffrey of Monmouth==\n\nAmbrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' with the slightly garbled name ''Aurelius Ambrosius'', now presented as son of a King Constantine. King Constantine's eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern's instigation, and the two remaining sons (Ambrosius and Uther, still very young) are quickly hustled into exile in [[Brittany]]. (This does not fit with Gildas' account, in which Ambrosius' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, the two brothers return from exile with a large army when Vortigern's power has faded. They destroy Vortigern and become friends with [[Merlin]].  They go on to defeat the Saxon leader [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist]] in two battles at Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near [[Sheffield]]) and [[Conisbrough|Cunengeburg]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=English |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Maisbeli: A Place-Name Problem from Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/11.short?rss=1 |journal=Notes & Queries |volume=259 |pages=11\u201313 |accessdate=14 July 2014 |doi=10.1093/notesj/gjt236}}</ref>  Hengist is executed and Ambrosius becomes king of Britain. However, he is poisoned by his enemies, and Uther succeeds him. The text identifies the poisoner as Eopa.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nJudgements tend to vary wildly of the value of Geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller. He has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources, and condemned for an excessive use of [[artistic license]] and possibly inventing stories wholecloth. \n<ref name=\"Reno\"/> According to Frank D. Reno, whenever Geoffrey uses extant sources, the details in the text tend to be accurate. Assuming that he was also using sources lost to us, it may be difficult to decide which details are truthful and which [[fraudulent]]. Reno suggests that \"individual judgements\" have to be made about various elements of his narrative.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nGeoffrey changed the word \"Aurelianus\" to \"[[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelius]]\", which is the [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|name]] of a Roman [[gens]].<ref name=\"Reno\"/> Geoffrey retains the story of Emrys and the dragons from Nennius, but identifies the figure with [[Merlin]]. Merlin is Geoffrey's version of a historical figure known as [[Myrddin Wyllt]]. Myrddin is only mentioned once in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', at an entry dated to 573.<ref name=\"Reno\"/> The name of Merlin is given in Latin as Ambrosius Merlinus. \"Merlinus\" may have been intended as the [[agnomen]] of a Roman or Romano-British individual like Ambrosius.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nElements of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the traditional warrior king, are used by Geoffrey for other characters. Ambrosius' supposed supernatural powers are passed to Merlin. Geoffrey's Aurelius Ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early, passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called [[Uther Pendragon]]. The role of warrior king is shared by Uther and his son [[King Arthur|Arthur]].<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nGeoffrey also uses the character [[Gloiu]], father of Vitalinus/Vitolinus, derived from Nennius. He names this character as a son of Claudius and appointed by his father as Duke of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. His predecessor as Duke is called [[Arvirargus]].<ref name=\"Reno\"/> Assuming that Claudius and Arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries, then this Claudius is the Roman emperor [[Claudius|Claudius I]] (reigned 41\u201354). It seems unlikely that Claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century, four centuries following his death. Reno suggests that [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius II]] (reigned 268\u2013270) would be a more likely \"Claudius\" to have living descendants in the 5th century.<ref name=\"Reno\"/>\n\nGeoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of Ambrosius. He is supposedly a paternal nephew of [[Aldroenus]], King of Brittany, son of [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine]] and an unnamed Briton noblewoman, adoptive grandson (on his mother's side) of Guthelinus/Vitalinus, [[Bishop of London]], younger brother of [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans]] and older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]].<ref name=\"Ashley2\">Ashley (2005), Geoffrey of Monmouth, unnumbered pages</ref> Ambrosius and Uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather Guthelinus/Vitalinus.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> It is not explicitly covered in Geoffrey's narrative, but this genealogy makes Constantine and his children descendants of [[Conan Meriadoc]], legendary founder of the line of Kings of Brittany. Conan is also featured in the ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', where he is appointed king by Roman emperor [[Magnus Maximus]] (reigned 383\u2013388).<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nConstantine's reign is placed by Geoffrey as following the [[Groans of the Britons]] mentioned by Gildas. Constantine is reported killed by a [[Picts|Pict]] and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included all three sons of Constantine, but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne. Constans was a [[monk]], and Ambrosius and Uther were [[Minor (law)|underage]] and still in their [[Bassinet|cradle]].<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> The crisis is resolved when [[Vortigern]] places Constans on the throne, and then serves as his chief [[adviser]] and [[power behind the throne]]. When Constans is killed by the Picts serving as bodyguards of Vortigern, Vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed. Ambrosius is still underage and Vortigern rises to the throne.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nThe chronology offered by Geoffrey for the early life of Ambrosius contradicts Gildas and Nennius, and is also internally inconsistent.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> The [[Groans of the Britons]] involves an appeal by the Britons to Roman consul \"Agitius\". This person has been identified with [[Flavius Aetius]] (d. 454), [[magister militum]] (\"master of soldiers\") of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and consul of the year 446. The Groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s, preceding the death of Aetius. If Geoffrey's Constantine rose to the throne immediately following the Groans, this would place his reign in this period.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Geoffrey gives a 10-year reign for Constantine and his marriage lasts just as long. However the eldest son Constans is clearly older than 10 years by the time his father dies. He is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career. Even assuming there is a time gap between the death of Constantine and the adulthood of Constans, his younger brothers \nhave not aged at all in the narrative.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\nGeoffrey's narrative has an underage Ambrosius, if not a literal [[infant]], in the 460s. Accounts deriving from Gildas and Nennius place Ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Most telling is that Geoffrey has Vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s. Nennius places the rise of Vortigern in the year 425, and Vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s. Suggesting that he was deceased by that time.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nGeoffrey's narrative includes as a major character [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist]], as leader of the Saxons. He is also featured as the father of Queen [[Rowena]] and father-in-law of Vortigern.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Other Saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer, but their names tend to correspond to Anglo-Saxons known from other sources.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Henginst's supposed son Octa is apparently [[Octa of Kent]], a 6th-century ruler variously connected to Hengist as a son or descendant. The other son, Ebissa, is more difficult to identify. He might correspond to kinsmen of Hengist variously identified as \"Ossa\", \"[[Oisc of Kent|Oisc]]\", and \"Aesc\". A minor Saxon character called \"Cherdic\" is probably [[Cerdic of Wessex]], though elsewhere Geoffrey calls the same king \"Cheldric\". He actually may appear under three different names in the narrative, since Geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of Hengist \"Ceretic\", a variant of the same name.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nGeoffrey, in the last chapters featuring Vortigern, has the king served by [[magician (fantasy)|magicians]]. This detail derives from Nennius, though Nennius was talking about Vortigern's \"wise men\". They may not have been magic users but advisers.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Vortigern's encounter with Emrys/Merlin takes place in this part of the narrative. Merlin warns Vortigern that Ambrosius and Uther have already sailed for Britain and are soon to arrive, apparently to claim his throne. Ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king. He besieges Vortigern at the castle of \"Genoreu\", which is identified with Nennius' ''Cair Guorthigirn'' (\"[[Caer|Fort]] [[Vortigern]]\") and the [[British hillforts|hillfort]] at [[The Doward|Little Doward]]. Ambrosius burns the castle down and Vortigern dies with it.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nHaving killed Vortigern, Ambrosius next turns his attention to Hengist. Despite the fact that no earlier military actions of Ambrosius are recorded, the Saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess. They immediately retreat beyond the [[Humber]].<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Hengist soon amasses a massive army to face Ambrosius. His army counts 200,000 men and Ambrosius' only 10,000 men. He marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in Maisbeli, where Ambrosius emerges the victor. It is unclear what location Geoffrey had in mind. Maisbeli translates to \"the field of Beli\", and could be related to the [[Beli Mawr]] of Welsh legend and/or the [[Celtic deities|Celtic god]] [[Belenus]]. Alternatively it could be a field where the [[Beltane]] festival was celebrated.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Geoffrey could derive the name from a similar-sounding toponym. For example, [[Meicen]] of the [[Hen Ogledd]] (\"Old North\"), traditionally identified with [[Battle of Hatfield Chase|Hatfield]].<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nFollowing his defeat, Hengist retreats towards Cunungeburg. Geoffrey probably had in mind [[Conisbrough]], not far from Hatfield.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the Saxons. The second battle is more evenly fought, and Hengist has a chance to achieve victory. However, Ambrosius receives reinforcements from Brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the Britons. Hengist himself is captured by his old enemy [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester]] and decapitated. Soon after the battle, the surviving Saxon leaders Octa and Eosa submit themselves to Ambrosius' rule. He pardons them and grants them an area near [[Scotland]]. The area is not named, but Geoffrey could be basing this on [[Bernicia]], a real Ango-Saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of Scotland and England.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nGeoffrey closely connects the deaths of Vortigern and Hengist, which are elsewhere poorly recorded. Vortigern historically died in the 450s, and various dates for the death of Hengist have been proposed, between the 450s and the 480s.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> [[Octa of Kent]], the supposed son and heir of Hengist, was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father. The ruling family of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] were called the Oiscingas, a term identifying them as descendants of [[Oisc of Kent]], not of Hengist. In effect, none of them was likely a literal son of Hengist and their relation to Hengist may have been a later invention. Geoffrey did not invent the connection, but his sources here were likely legendary  in nature.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\nFollowing his victories and the end of the wars, Ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at Kaercaradduc. Geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with Caer-Caradog ([[Salisbury]]). Ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to Merlin. The result is the so-called Giants' Ring.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/> Its location in the vicinity of Salisbury has led to its identification with [[Stonehenge]], though Geoffrey never uses that term. Stonehenge is closer to [[Amesbury]] than Salisbury. The ring formation of the monument could equally apply to [[Avebury]], the largest stone circle in Europe.<ref name=\"Ashley2\"/>\n\n==In other texts==\n\nIn Welsh legend and texts, Ambrosius appears as ''Emrys Wledig'' (Emperor Ambrose).<ref name=\"Venning\"/> The term \"Wledig\" is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success. The term is mostly used for famous figures such as [[Cunedda]], though a few obscure figures have been given the title.<ref name=\"Venning\"/>\n\nIn [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Merlin'' he is called simply ''Pendragon'' and his younger brother is named ''Uter'', which he changes to ''Uterpendragon'' after the death of the elder sibling. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]''. Wace usually only refers to ''li roi'' (\"the king\") without naming him, and someone has taken an early mention of Uther's epithet ''Pendragon'' as the name of his brother.\n\n==Possible identification with other figures==\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[L\u00e9on Fleuriot]] has suggested Ambrosius is identical to [[Riothamus]], a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470. Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle, in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Fleuriot proposed that he then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.<ref name=\"leo\">L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l\u2019\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980, p. 170</ref>\n\n==Place-name evidence==\nIt has been suggested that the place-name [[Amesbury]] in [[Wiltshire]] might preserve the name of Ambrosius, and that perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Applebaum |first=Shimon |date=1983 |title=A note on Ambrosius Aurelianus |journal=Britannia |volume=14 |pages=245\u2013246 |doi=10.2307/526352}}<!--|accessdate=9 May 2014 --></ref>  Scholars such as Shimon Applebaum have found a number of [[Toponymy|place names]] through the Midland dialect regions of Britain that incorporate the ''ambre-'' element; examples include [[Ombersley]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[Ambrosden]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[Amberley, Herefordshire|Amberley]] in [[Herefordshire]], [[Amberley, Gloucestershire|Amberley]] in Gloucestershire, and [[Amberley, West Sussex|Amberley]] in West Sussex. These scholars have claimed that this element represents an [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''amor'', the name of a woodland bird. However, Amesbury in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names.\n\n==Modern fictional treatments==\nThe novel ''[[Coalescent]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] depicts Aurelianus as a general to Artorius, Briton and basis for the legend of [[King Arthur]].  In Baxter's novel, Aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book's main Roman-era protagonist, Regina, founder of a (literally) underground matriarchal society.  In the text, he is credited with winning the battle of [[Mount Badon]].\n\nIn [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Aurelianus is depicted as the aging High King of Britain, a \"too-ambitious\" son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister's son is [[Uther Pendragon]], but Uther is described as not having any Roman blood. Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.\n\nIn [[Alfred Duggan]]'s ''[[Conscience of the King (novel)|Conscience of the King]]'', a [[historical novel]] about [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]], founder of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]], Ambrosius Aurelianus is a Romano-British general who rose independently to military power, forming alliances with various British kings and setting out to drive the invading Saxons from [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. Cerdic, who is of both [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and British descent and raised as a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]], served in his army as a young man. In the novel Ambrosius is a separate character from Arthur, or Artorius, who appears much later as a foe of Cerdic.\n\nIn [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'', Aurelianus (most often referred to as \"Aurelius\") figures prominently, along with his brother Uther, in the second book of the series, ''Merlin''. He is poisoned soon after becoming [[High King]] of Britain, and Uther succeeds him. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry [[Igraine]] and become the true father of King Arthur (Uther does marry his brother's widow, though).\n\nIn [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Aurelianus (here called \"Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius\") is a major character and is shown as one of the last loyal Romans, going to enormous lengths for his boy emperor [[Romulus Augustus]], whose power has been wrested by the barbarian [[Odoacer]]. In this story, Romulus Augustus marries [[Igraine]], and [[King Arthur]] is their son, and the sword of [[Julius Caesar]] becomes the legendary [[Excalibur]] in Britain. In the 2007 film version of the novel, he is played by [[Colin Firth]] and his name becomes \"Aurelianus Caius Antonius\". In both he is called \"Aurelius\" for short.\n\n[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of [[Mithras]], and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin's attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin's eyes as a model of good kingship.\n\nIn [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s ''[[The Lantern Bearers (Sutcliff novel)|The Lantern Bearers]]'' Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus of Arfon drives out the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry. By the end of the novel, the elite [[cavalry wing]] is led by a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, whom Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur.\n\nIn [[Parke Godwin]]'s ''[[Firelord (novel)|Firelord]]'', Ambrosius is the elderly tribune of the diminished, dispirited and politically fractured [[Legio VI Victrix]] garrisoning [[Hadrian's Wall]]. Near his death, he names Artorius Pendragon (Arthur) as his successor, encourages him to convert the legion to alae (heavy cavalry) and allows the legionnaires to renounce their loyalty to Rome and take personal oaths of fealty to Artorius in order to help unify Brittania politically and to create a military force with the ability to quickly redeploy to meet differing threats.\n\nIn [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[Camulod Chronicles]]'', Ambrosius Aurelianus is the half-brother of Caius Merlyn Britannicus (Merlin) and helps him lead the people of Camulod ([[Camelot]]).\n\nIn ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', Ambrosius and Arthur are one and the same. [[Moros (Stargate)|Merlin]] was an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]], fleeing from [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] and later Ascends, then comes back in order to build the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]], or Holy Grail, to defeat the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]].

In 734 BC the Ammonite king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and Sanipu's successor [[Pudu-ilu]] held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ammonites|volume=1|pages=863-864}}</ref> An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did.<ref>See Schrader, ''K.A.T.'' pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, ''Paradies,'' p. 294; Winckler, ''Geschichte Israels,'' p. 215.</ref>\n\nSomewhat later, the Ammonite king [[Amminadab I of Ammon|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great [[Arabia]]n campaign of [[Assurbanipal]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barachel (Ammon)|Barachel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seals]]) and [[Hissalel]], the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at [[Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King [[Amminadab II of Ammon|Amminadab II]], who reigned around 600 BCE.\n\nArchaeology and history indicate that Ammon flourished during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period. This contradicts the view, dominant for decades, that Transjordan was either destroyed by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], or suffered a rapid decline following Judah's destruction by that king.

After the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the daughters of Lot wanted to have a child and carried out a plot to intoxicate him and had relations, resulting in Ammon and his half brother, [[Moab]], being conceived and born. This narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact, but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the Israelites expressed their loathing of the morality of the Moabites and Ammonites, although it is doubtful that the Israelites would have directed such irony to Lot himself.<ref name=Fenlon>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01431b.htm Fenlon, John Francis. \"Ammonites.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1.

During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of Moab in attacking Israel.\n\nThe Ammonites maintained their claim to part of [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]], after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from [[Sihon]]. During the days of [[Jephthah]], the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions.\n\nThe constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]]. King [[Nahash of Ammon]] ({{circa|1010}}{{snd}}990 BC) lay siege to [[Jabesh-Gilead]]. Eventually this led to an alliance with Saul and The Israelites, led by Saul relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the Israelite Kingdom.\n\nDuring the reign of [[King David]], the Ammonites humiliated David's messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of [[Rabbah]], the capital of Ammon. The war ended with all the Ammonite cities being conquered and plundered, and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at David's command.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:31|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|20:3|KJV}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Arameans of Damascus city-state deprived the Kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became allies of [[Hadadezer|Ben-hadad]], and a contingent of 1,000 of them served as allies of Syria in the great [[Battle of Qarqar|battle]] of the Arameans and Assyrians at [[Qarqar]] in 854 BC in the reign of [[Shalmaneser III]].\n\nThe Ammonites, Moabites and [[Meunim]] formed a coalition against [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah.

The legitimacy of [[David]]'s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.<ref>According to Babylonian [[Talmud]], [[Doeg the Edomite]] was the source of this dispute. He claimed that since David was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community, his male ancestors were no longer part of the [[tribe of Judah]] (which was the tribe the King had to belong to).  As a result, he could neither be the king, nor could he marry any Jewish woman (since he descended from a [[Moab]]ite convert). The Prophet [[Samuel]] wrote the Book of Ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from [[Moab]] and Ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the Jewish people immediately.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Ammonite language}}\nThe few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and [[Hanun]], both from the Bible.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Ammonites' language is believed to be in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite family]], closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]].

When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to [[Athens]] where they studied under [[Proclus]]. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to [[Damascius]], during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures.<ref>Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi</ref> Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote.

A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.\n\nIn ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent.

He is mainly known as the teacher of [[Plotinus]], whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243. He was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of [[Neoplatonism]], although little is known about his own philosophical views. Later [[Christian]] writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian, but it is now generally assumed that there was a different [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] who wrote biblical texts.\n\n==Life==\nHis father Hermeias came from Alexandria, and Ammonius inherited the chair of philosophy at Alexandria from him. [[Damascius]]' ''History'' is considered the source containing most details about Ammonius' life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His cognomen \"Sakkas\" has been interpreted to indicate that he was a porter in his youth.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Ammonius%20Saccas Mozley, J.R., \"Ammonius Saccas\", ''Dictionary of Early Christian Biography'', (Henry WAce, ed.), John Murrary & Co., London, 1911]</ref> This seems to be a misreading of \"Sakkas\" for \"sakkophoros\" (porter) which is grammatically incorrect. However Erich Seeberg<ref>Seeberg, Erich, \"Ammonius Sakas\", in: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kirchengeschichte, vol. LX, 1941, pp. 136 - 170</ref> argued that the cognomen refers to the \"[[Shakya|\u015a\u0101kyas]]\" of India, the ruling clan to which Gautama Buddha also belonged{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}. The cognomen \"Sakkas\" therefore referred to India <ref>Benz, Ernst, \"Indische Einfl\u00fcsse auf die fr\u00fchchristliche Theologie\" in: Abhandlungen der Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse, Jahrgang 1951, no. 3, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz, pp. 1 - 34, pp. 30ff.</ref> as a marker of ethnic identity. This is, according to this interpretation, supported by the fact that Ammianus Marcellinus refers to him as \"Saccas Ammonius\", thus as the \"Sacian Ammonius\",<ref>ibidem</ref> which makes any reading as denoting \"sakkos\" impossible. This interpretation of the name, which has subsequently been contested,<ref>Clifford Hindley: ''Ammonios Sakkas. His Name and Origin''. In: ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kirchengeschichte'' 75, 1964, pp. 332\u2013336.</ref> would corroborate Porphyry's report that Plotinus, Ammonius' foremost student, acquired his high esteem for Indian philosophy and his eager desire to travel to India from Ammonius.<ref>ibidem, cf. Porphyry's Vita Plotini, chapt. 3</ref>\n\nThe interpretation that \"Saccas\" denotes ethnic northern Indian origin, rather than alluding to Gautama Buddha, supports the possibility that Ammonius may have been raised a Christian, who reverted to paganism, as reported by Eusebius,<ref>Eusebius, Historia eccl. VI, 9</ref> drawing on Porphyry's Contra Christianos. In this case Ammonius may have been a second-generation Indian who remained in contact with the philosophy of his ancestral country. The intensity of commerce of goods and ideas between Alexandria and India makes this a wholly possible option.\n\nThe link to India however is not only consistent with Plotinus' passion for India, but also helps to explain the often noted substantial agreements and shared ideas between Vedanta and Neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to direct Indian influence.<ref>Harris, R. Baine (ed.), Neoplatonism and Indian Thought, Norfolk Va., 1982: [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies|The International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]]</ref>\n\nMost details of his life come from the fragments left from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s writings. The most famous pupil of Ammonius Saccas was [[Plotinus]] who studied under Ammonius for eleven years. According to Porphyry, in 232, at the age of 28, Plotinus went to [[Alexandria]] to study philosophy:\n<blockquote>In his twenty-eighth year he [Plotinus] felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in Alexandria who then had the highest reputation; but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends. The friend, understanding the desire of his heart, sent him to Ammonius, whom he had not so far tried. He went and heard him, and said to his friend, \"This is the man I was looking for.\" From that day he stayed continually with Ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians.<ref name=\"porphyry1\">Porphyry, ''Life of Plotinus'', from Reale, G., (1990), ''A History of Ancient Philosophy IV: The Schools of the Imperial Age.'' Page 298. SUNY Press.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Porphyry, the parents of Ammonius were [[Christians]], but upon learning Greek philosophy, Ammonius rejected his parents' religion for [[paganism]]. This conversion is contested by the Christian writers [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]], who state that Ammonius remained a Christian throughout his lifetime:\n\n<blockquote>[Porphyry] plainly utters a falsehood (for what will not an opposer of Christians do?) when he says that ... Ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs. ... Ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life. His works yet extant show this, as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left.<ref name=\"eusebius1\">Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', vi, 19.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, we are told by [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Longinus]] that Ammonius wrote nothing,<ref>Longinus, quoted by Porphyry, ''Life of Plotinus'', xx.</ref> and if Ammonius was the principal influence on Plotinus, then it is unlikely that Ammonius would have been a Christian. One way to explain much of the confusion concerning Ammonius is to assume that there were two people called Ammonius: Ammonius Saccas who taught Plotinus, and an [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius the Christian]] who wrote biblical texts. Another explanation might be that there was only one Ammonius but that Origen, who found the Neo-Platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of Christianity, chose to suppress Ammonius' choice of Paganism over Christianity.  The insistence of Eusebius, Origen's pupil, and Jerome, all of whom were recognized Fathers of the Christian Church, that Ammonius Saccas had not rejected his Christian roots would be easier for Christians to accept than the assertion of Prophyry, who was a Pagan, that Ammonius had chosen Paganism over Christianity.\n\nTo add to the confusion, it seems that Ammonius had two pupils called Origen: [[Origen|Origen the Christian]], and [[Origen the Pagan]].<ref name=\"eusebius1\"/> It is quite possible that Ammonius Saccas taught both Origens. And since there were two Origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later Christians to accept that there were two individuals named Ammonius, one a Christian and one a Pagan.  Among Ammonius' other pupils there were [[Herennius (Neoplatonist)|Herennius]] and [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]], writing in the 5th century, states that Ammonius' fundamental doctrine was that [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] were in full agreement with each other:<ref>Hierocles in Photius, ''Bibl.'' cod. 214, 251.</ref>\n<blockquote>He was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority, which were a disgrace to philosophy. He apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers [Plato and Aristotle] and brought them under one and the same ''[[nous]]'' and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples, and especially to the best of those acquainted with him, Plotinus, Origen, and their successors.<ref>Hierocles, in Photius, ''Bibl.'' cod. 251. from Karamanolis, G., (2006), ''Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry'', Page 193. Oxford University Press.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Nemesius]], a [[bishop]] and [[Neoplatonist]] c. 400,  Ammonius held that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] was immaterial.<ref>Nemesius, ''On the Nature of Man'', ii</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Ammonius's role in the development of [[Neoplatonism]]. Porphyry seems to suggest that Ammonius was instrumental in helping Plotinus think about philosophy in new ways:\n<blockquote>But he [Plotinus] did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration, and brought the mind of Ammonius' to bear on the investigation in hand.<ref name=\"porphyry1\"/></blockquote>\nTwo of Ammonius's students - [[Origen the Pagan]], and [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Longinus]] - seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to [[Middle Platonism]] than Neoplatonism, which perhaps suggests that Ammonius's doctrines were also closer to those of Middle Platonism than the Neoplatonism developed by Plotinus (see the [[Enneads]]), but Plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Enneads]]\n*[[Neoplatonism]]\n*[[Origen]]\n*[[Origen the Pagan]]\n*[[Plotinus]]\n*[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]\n*[[Theodidaktos]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Armstrong, A., (1967), ''The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy'',  Cambridge University Press, pp.&nbsp;196\u2013200.\n*Karamanolis, G., (2006), ''Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry'',  Oxford University Press, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013215.\n*Reale, G., (1990), ''A History of Ancient Philosophy IV: The Schools of the Imperial Age'',  SUNY Press, pp.&nbsp;297\u2013303.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_against_christians_02_fragments.htm ''Porphyry, Against the Christians (2004).

As it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of God, even Israel and Judah will not be exempt from the judgment of God because of their idolatry and unjust ways. The nation that represents YHWH must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of God. God's name must be exalted.\n\nAmos is the first prophet to use the term \"the [[Day of the Lord]].<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009). p. 260</ref> This phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature. For the people of Israel \"the day of the {{Lord}}\" is the day when God will fight against his and their enemies, and it will be a day of victory for Israel. However, Amos and other prophets include Israel as an enemy of God, as Israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent, poor, and young women.<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2009. pp. 258\u201359.</ref> To Amos \"the day of the Lord\" will be a day of doom.\n\nOther major ideas in the book of Amos include: [[social justice]] and concern for the disadvantaged;  the idea that Israel's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God did not exempt them from accountability for sin;  God is God of all nations;  God is judge of all nations;  God is God of moral righteousness;  God made all people;  God elected Israel and then liberated Israel so that He would be known throughout the world;  election by God means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the covenant;  if God destroys the unjust, a remnant will remain;  and God is free to judge whether to redeem Israel.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                              = Bandstra\n|first                             = Barry L.\n|title                             = Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n|publisher                         = Cengage Learning\n|year                              = 2008\n|url                               = https://books.google.com/books?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA489&lpg=PA489&dq=Bandstra,+Barry+L+%282004%29.+Reading+the+Old+Testament:+an+introduction+to+the+Hebrew+Bible#v=onepage&q=Isaiah&f=false\n|ref                               = harv\n|isbn                             = 0495391050\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                              = Barton\n|first                             = John\n|title                             = The Theology of the Book of Amos\n|publisher                         = Cambridge University Press\n|year                              = 2012\n|url                               = https://books.google.com/books?id=LrEYKKOZAfwC&pg=PA35&dq=%22Amos:+the+critical+issues%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju8bfrwd_SAhWGnJQKHceDBTcQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=%22Amos%3A%20the%20critical%20issues%22&f=false\n|ref                               = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Carroll R.\n|first                             = M.

The finds are displayed at the [[Amphipolis Archaeological Museum|archaeological museum of Amphipolis]].

The [[Lion of Amphipolis]] monument nearby is a popular destination for visitors.\n\nIt was located within the region of [[Edonis (region)|Edonis]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThroughout the 5th century BC, [[Classical Athens|Athens]] sought to consolidate its control over [[Thrace]], which was strategically important because of its primary materials (the gold and silver of the [[Pangaion hills]] and the dense forests essential for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens' supply of grain from [[Scythia]]. After a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in 497&nbsp;BC by the [[Miletus|Milesian]] [[Tyrant]] [[Histiaeus]], the Athenians founded a first colony at Ennea-Hodoi (\u2018Nine Ways\u2019) in 465&nbsp;BC, but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the [[Thracians]].<ref>[[Thucydides]] I, 100, 3</ref> A second attempt took place in 437&nbsp;BC on the same site under the guidance of [[Hagnon, son of Nikias|Hagnon]], son of [[Nicias]], which was successful. The city and its first walls date from this time.\n\n[[File:Plan Amphipolis-en.svg|thumb|left|Map of Amphipolis]]\n[[File:Kasta tumulus and Lion of Amphipolis location map en.jpg|thumb|Amphipolis location map]]\n\nThe new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, \"around the city\"), a name which is the subject of much debate about its [[etymology]]. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the [[Strymon River]] flows \"around the city\" on two sides;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc%3DPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%26layout%3D%26loc%3D4.102.3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209111244/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}</ref> however a note in the ''[[Suda]]'' (also given in the lexicon of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]) offers a different explanation apparently given by [[Marsyas]], son of [[Periander]]: that a large proportion of the population lived \"around the city\". However, a more probable explanation is the one given by [[Julius Pollux]]: that the name indicates the vicinity of an [[isthmus]].\n\nAmphipolis became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their [[Sparta]]n adversaries. The Athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc%3DPerseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Bquery%3Dchapter%3D%23471%3Blayout%3D%3Bloc%3D4.105.1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209111244/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200 |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}</ref> For this reason Amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the Athenians, rather than a colony or member of the Athens-led [[Delian League]]. However, in 424&nbsp;BC the Spartan general [[Brasidas]] easily took control of the city.\n\nA rescue expedition led by the Athenian general, and later historian, [[Thucydides]] had to settle for securing [[Eion]] and could not retake Amphipolis, a failure for which Thucydides was sentenced to exile. A new Athenian force under the command of [[Cleon]] failed once more in 422&nbsp;BC during the [[Battle of Amphipolis]] at which both Cleon and Brasidas lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp.

In 357&nbsp;BC, Philip succeeded where the Athenians had failed and conquered the city, thereby removing the obstacle which Amphipolis presented to Macedonian control over Thrace. According to the historian [[Theopompus]], this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between Athens and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna as well.<ref>Theopompus, Philippica</ref>\n\nThe city was not immediately incorporated into the Macedonian kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonian governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively \"Macedonianized\". Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the [[Stater|gold stater]], created by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan [[drachma]]) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of [[Alexander the Great]], Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian admirals: [[Nearchus]], Androsthenes<ref>https://books.google.com/books?um=1&q=Androsthenes+Thasos&btnG=Search+Books</ref> and [[Laomedon of Mytilene|Laomedon]], whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.\n\nThe importance of the city in this period is shown by Alexander the Great's decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1,500 [[talent (coin)|talents]] were built. Alexander prepared for campaigns here against Thrace in 335&nbsp;BC and the his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of Asia. The port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in Asia. After Alexander's death, his wife [[Roxana]] and their young son Alexander&nbsp;IV were exiled by [[Cassander]] and later murdered here.<ref>Diodorus Siculus, Library of History Book XIX, 52</ref>\n\nThroughout Macedonian sovereignty Amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance, as shown by inscriptions. Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between [[Philippi]] and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', the principal [[Roman roads|Roman road]] which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town, the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and an [[Ephebos|ephebarchic]] law from the gymnasium.\n\n===Conquest by the Romans===\nAfter the final victory of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] over Macedonia in the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168&nbsp;BC, Amphipolis became the capital of one of the four mini-republics, or ''merides'', which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the [[Antigonid Dynasty|Antigonids]] which [[Diadochi|succeeded]] Alexander's empire in Macedon. These ''merides'' were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of [[Thracia]]. According to the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', the apostles [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and [[Silas]] passed through Amphipolis in the early AD&nbsp;50s, on their [[Missionary journeys of Paul|journey]] between [[Philippi]] and [[Thessalonica]]; where hence they proselytized to the Greeks, including {{wiktang|aporetic}} [[Epicurean]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers.<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|17:1|NKJV}}</ref>\n\n===Revival in Late Antiquity===\nDuring the period of [[Late Antiquity]], Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of [[Christianity|Christian churches]] that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the [[acropolis]]. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.\n\nNevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the 5th and 6th centuries are impressive. Four [[basilica]]s adorned with rich [[mosaic]] floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed [[column]] capitals \u2013 see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the [[Basilica of San Vitale|basilica]] of [[Saint Vitalis of Milan|St Vitalis]] in [[Ravenna]]. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian [[Andr\u00e9 Boulanger]] is that an increasing \u2018willingness\u2019 on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local [[gentrification]] projects (which he terms ''[[euergetism]]'', from the Greek verb {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9}}; meaning 'I do good') was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city's territory. Amphipolis was also a [[diocese]] under the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Thessalonica]] \u2013 the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533. The bishopric is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 831</ref>\n\n===Final decline of the city===\nThe [[South Slavs#Interaction with the Balkan population|Slavic invasions]] of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the [[Thermae|Roman baths]], and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.\n\nThe city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] under the name \u201c[[Chrysopolis (Thrace)|Chrysopolis]]\u201d. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the ''[[megas primikerios]]'' John and the ''[[stratopedarches]]'' Alexios to protect the land that they had given to the [[Pantokratoros monastery|monastery of Pantokrator]] on [[Mount Athos]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Amphipolis frescoes.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from a house (Hellenistic period).]]\n[[File:Silver ossuary and gold crown of Brasidas.jpg|thumb|Silver ossuary and gold crown of [[Brasidas]]]]\n\nThe site was discovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during the 19th century, including E. Cousin\u00e9ry (1831) (engraver), [[Leon Heuzey]] (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894\u20131899). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Greek Archaeological Society]] under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the city wall (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis. Further excavations have since uncovered the river bridge, the gymnasium, Greek and Roman villas and numerous tombs etc.\n\nParts of the lion monument and tombs were discovered during World War I by Bulgarian and British troops whilst digging trenches in the area. In 1934, M. Feyel, of the [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Ath\u00e8nes]] (EfA), led an [[epigraphy|epigraphical mission]] to the site and uncovered further remains of the lion monument (a reconstruction was given in the ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hell\u00e9nique'', a publication of the EfA which is available on line).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120604182322/http://cefael.efa.gr/detail.php?site_id=1&actionID=page&prevpos=0&serie_id=BCH&volume_number=59&issue_number=0&startpos=289 Bulletin de Correspondance Hell\u00e9nique] {{fr icon}}</ref>\n\nThe silver ossuary containing the cremated remains of [[Brasidas]] <ref>A.

The large size of the tumulus indicates the prominence of the burials made there. The perimeter wall of the tumulus is {{cvt|497|m|yd}} long, and is made of limestone covered with marble.\n\nThe tomb comprises three chambers separated by walls. There are two [[sphinxes]] just outside the entrance to the tomb. Two of the columns supporting the roof in the first section are in the form of [[Caryatid]]s, in the 4th century BC style. The excavation revealed a pebble mosaic showing the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Hades]] directly behind the Caryatids and in front of the Macedonian marble door leading to the \"third\" chamber. Hades' chariot is drawn by two white horses and led to the underworld by [[Hermes]]. The mosaic verifies the Macedonian character of the tomb. As the head of one of the sphinxes was found inside the tomb behind the broken door, it is clear that there were intruders, probably in antiquity.\n\nThe identity of the burial remains unknown and the excavation is continuing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28758920|title=Greek tomb at Amphipolis is 'important discovery'|date=12 August 2014|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> Dr. [[Katerina Peristeri]], the archaeologist heading the excavation of the tomb, dates the tomb to the late 4th century BC, the period after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] (323&nbsp;BC).\n\nIn November 2017, the Greek Minister of Culture, Lydia Koniordou, announced that the grave should be accessible to the public in about three years.

But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the [[Illyria]]ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the [[Thessalia]]ns, he recovered his kingdom.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Amyntas II|inline=y|volume=1|pages=900-901}}</ref> Medius, head of the house of the [[Aleuadae]] of [[Larissa]], is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne.  The mutual relationship between the [[Argead dynasty|Argeadae]] and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus.\n\nTo shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the [[Chalkidian League]] led by [[Olynthus]].  In exchange for this support, Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber, which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet. With [[money]] flowing into Olynthus from these exports, their power grew. In response, Amyntas sought additional allies. He established connections with [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|Kotys]], chief of the [[Odrysians]]. Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]].  Prevented from marrying into Kotys' family, Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son.\n\nAfter the King's Peace 387 BC, [[History of Sparta|Sparta]] was anxious to re-establish its presence in northern Greece.

When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus, the Spartans eagerly responded.  That Olynthus was backed by Athens and Thebes, rivals to Sparta for the control of Greece, provided them with an additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north.  Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans, who assisted him to reduce [[Olynthus]] (379).  He also entered into a league with [[Jason of Pherae]], and assiduously cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 371 BC at a Panhellenic congress of the [[Lacedaemonian]] allies, he voted in support of the [[Athenians]]' claim and joined other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of [[Amphipolis]].<ref>[[Aeschines]] - On the Embassy [http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aeschines-embassy.html 2.32]</ref><ref>History of Greece [https://books.google.com/books?id=5hcPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA336&dq=371+BC+Amyntas+Amphipolis#PPA339,M1] by George Grote</ref>\n\nWith Olynthus defeated, Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself. Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]], in [[Piraeus]].\n\n== Family ==\n\nAmyntas married [[Eurydice I of Macedon|Eurydice]], daughter of [[Sirras|Sirras of Lynkestis]], circa 390.<ref name=\"women_macedonia\">{{cite book|last1=Carney|first1=Elizabeth|title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia|date=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3212-4}}</ref> By her, Amyntas had three sons, all of whom became kings of Macedonia one after the other, and a daughter:\n*[[Alexander II of Macedon|Alexander II]]\n*[[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]]\n*[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]]. \n*Eurynoe: According to Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Eurynoe prevented Amyntas' assassination by her mother and her husband (thought to be [[Ptolemy of Aloros]]), who was also her mother's lover, by revealing the plan to her father.

Reputedly a forerunner of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], none of his works has survived.\n\n==Life==\nAnacharsis the son of Gnurus,<ref>Herodotus, iv. 76; Diogenes Laertius, i. 101; although [[Lucian]], (''Scytha'') calls him the son of Daucetas.</ref> a Scythian chief, was half Greek and from a mixed Hellenic culture, apparently in the region of the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. He left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge, and came to Athens about 589 BC,<ref>Sosicrates, ap Diogenes Laertius, i. 101</ref> at a time when [[Solon]] was occupied with [[Solonian Constitution|his legislative measures]].\n\nAccording to the story recounted by [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]],<ref>Hermippus, ap Diogenes Laertius, i. 101-2</ref> Anacharsis arrived at the house of Solon and said, \"I have traveled here from afar to make you my friend.\" Solon replied, \"It's better to make friends at home.\" Thereupon the Scythian replied, \"Then it is necessary for you, being at home, to make friends with me.\"  Solon laughed and accepted him as his friend.\n\nAnacharsis cultivated the outsider's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things. For example, Plutarch remarks that he \"expressed his wonder at the fact that in Greece wise men spoke and fools decided.\"<ref>Plutarch ''Solon'' 5 [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Solon#5]]</ref> His conversation was droll and frank, and Solon and the Athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher. His rough and free discourse became proverbial among Athenians as 'Scythian discourse'.<ref>Diogenes Laertius, i. 101</ref>\n\nAnacharsis was the first foreigner ([[metic]]) who received the privileges of Athenian citizenship. He was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]],<ref>Diogenes Laertius, i. 41-2</ref> and it is said that he was initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] of the Great Goddess, a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]],<ref>Herodotus, iv, 76; comp. Diogenes Laertius, i. 102</ref> when Anacharsis returned to the Scythians he was killed by his own brother for his Greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the Mother Goddess [[Cybele]], whose cult was unwelcome among the Scythians.\n\n==Ideas==\n[[Image:Nuremberg chronicles f 60r 1.png|right|thumb|Anacharsis, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nNone of the works ascribed to him in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], if indeed they were written by him, have survived. He was said to have written a book comparing the laws of the Scythians with the laws of the Greeks, as well as work on the art of war. All that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him. He became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the Greeks. He exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness; the third, disgust.<ref>Diogenes Laertius, i. 103</ref> So he became a kind of [[emblem]] to the Athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'Restrain your tongues, your appetites, your passions.'\n\nThere are ten extant letters ascribed to him, one of which is also quoted by [[Cicero]]:\n<blockquote>Greetings from Anacharsis to Hanno: My clothing is a Scythian cloak, my shoes are the hard soles of my feet, my bed is the earth, my food is only seasoned by hunger - and I eat nothing but milk and cheese and meat. Come and visit me, and you will find me at peace. You want to give me something. But give it to your fellow-citizens instead, or let the immortal gods have it.<ref>Pseudo-Anacharsis, ''Epistle'' 5, quoted in Cicero, ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', v. 32</ref></blockquote>\n \nAll of the letters are spurious.<ref name=\"malherbe\">Abraham J.

Among the Buddha's many disciples, \u0100nanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the [[sutra|texts]] of the early Buddhist ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta-Pi\u1e6daka]]'' ([[P\u0101li]]; {{lang-sa|S\u016btra-Pi\u1e6daka|italic=yes}}) are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the [[First Buddhist Council]]. For that reason, he is known as the '''Treasurer of the Dhamma''', with ''[[Dhamma]]'' ({{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes |link=no}}) referring to the Buddha's teaching. In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], \u0100nanda is the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the early texts do not agree on many parts of Ananda's early life, they do agree that \u0100nanda is ordained as a monk and that [[Pu\u1e47\u1e47a Mant\u0101niputta]] ({{lang-sa|P\u016br\u1e47a Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bputra|link=no}}) becomes his teacher. Twenty years in the Buddha's ministry, \u0100nanda becomes the attendant of the Buddha, when the Buddha selects him for this task. \u0100nanda performs his duties with great devotion and care, and acts as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laypeople, as well as the ''[[sa\u1e45gha]]'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes|link=no|lit=monastic community}}). He accompanies the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also a secretary and a mouthpiece.\n\nScholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in \u0100nanda's life, especially the First Council, and consensus about this has yet to be established. A traditional account can be drawn from early texts, [[atthakatha|commentaries]], and [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|post-canonical chronicles]]. \u0100nanda has an important role in establishing the order of ''[[bhikkhuni|bhikkhun\u012bs]]'' ({{lang-sa|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b|italic=yes|link=no |lit=nun}}), when he requests the Buddha on behalf of the latter's foster-mother [[Mahapajapati|Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b|link=no}}) to allow her to be ordained. \u0100nanda also accompanies the Buddha in the last year of his life, and therefore is witness to many tenets and principles that the Buddha conveys before his death, including the well-known principle that the Buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge, and that he will not appoint a new leader. The final period of the Buddha's life also shows that \u0100nanda is very much attached to the Buddha's person, and he sees the Buddha's passing with great sorrow.\n\nShortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council is convened, and \u0100nanda manages to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] just before the council starts, which is a requirement. He has a historical role during the council as the living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. During the same council, however, he is chastised by [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|link=no}}) and the rest of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. \u0100nanda continues to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils [[Shanavasa|S\u0101\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101\u1e47akav\u0101s\u012b|link=no}}) and Majjhantika ({{lang-sa|Madhy\u0101ntika|link=no}}), among others, who later assume a leading role in the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second]] and [[Third Buddhist Council|Third Councils]]. \u0100nanda dies 20 years after the Buddha, and ''[[st\u016bpa]]s'' (momuments) are erected at the river where he dies.\n\n\u0100nanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. \u0100nanda is known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and is often praised by the Buddha for these matters. He functions as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the Buddha, however, in that he still has worldly attachments and is not yet enlightened, as opposed to the Buddha. In the [[agama (Buddhism)|Sanskrit textual traditions]], \u0100nanda is considered the patriarch of the Dhamma, who stands in a spiritual lineage, receiving the teaching from Mah\u0101kassapa and passing them on to his own pupils. \u0100nanda has been honored by ''bhikkhun\u012bs'' since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun's order. In recent times, the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] were inspired by stories about \u0100nanda in their work.\n\n== Name ==\nThe word ''\u0101nanda'' means 'bliss, joy' in P\u0101li and in Sanskrit.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=\u0100nanda}}<ref name=\"Larson\">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Larson |first1=Paul |editor1-last=Leeming |editor1-first=David A. |editor2-last=Madden |editor2-first=Kathryn |editor3-last=Marlan |editor3-first=Stanton |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion |title=Ananda |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-0-387-71802-6 |page=35}}</ref> P\u0101li [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]] explain that when \u0100nanda is born, his relatives are joyous about this, and he therefore is named that way.

According to the P\u0101li and Mah\u012b\u015basaka textual traditions, the ''bhikkhun\u012b'' order is set up five years after the Buddha's enlightenment, but \u0100nanda only becomes attendant twenty years after the Buddha's enlightenment.<ref name=\"Krey\" /> Furthermore, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati is the Buddha's foster mother, and must therefore be considerably older than him. However, after the ''bhikkhun\u012b'' order is established, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati still has many audiences with the Buddha, as reported in P\u0101li and Chinese Early Buddhist Texts. Because of this and other reasons, it could be inferred that establishment of the ''bhikkhun\u012b'' order actually takes place ''early'' in the Buddha's ministry. If this is the case, \u0100nanda's role in establishing the order becomes less likely.<ref name=\"Mohr\" /> Some scholars therefore interpret the names in the account, such as ''\u0100nanda'' and ''Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati'', as symbols, representing groups rather than specific individuals.<ref name=\"Krey\">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Krey |first1=Gisela |editor1-last=Mohr |editor1-first=Thea |editor2-last=Tsedroen |editor2-first=Jampa |encyclopedia=Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns |date=2014 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |title=Some Remarks on the Status of Nuns and Laywomen in Early Buddhism |isbn=978-0-86171-830-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qy8qAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the texts, \u0100nanda's role in founding the ''bhikkhun\u012b'' order makes him popular with the ''bhikkhun\u012b'' community. \u0100nanda  often teaches ''bhikkhun\u012bs'',{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=\u0100nanda}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=384}}, often encourages women to ordain, and when he is criticized by the monk [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]], several ''bhikkhun\u012bs'' try to defend him.{{sfn |Ambros |2016 |page=209}}{{sfn |Hin\u00fcber |2007 |pages=233{{en dash}}4}} According to Indologist [[Oskar von Hin\u00fcber]], \u0100nanda's pro-''bhikkhun\u012b'' attitude may well be the reason why there is frequent discussion between \u0100nanda and Mah\u0101kassapa, eventually leading Mah\u0101kasapa to charge \u0100nanda with several [[apatti (Buddhist monastic discipline)|offenses]] during the First Buddhist Council.

M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition has it that the charges are laid before \u0100nanda becomes enlightened and starts the recitations. In this version, when \u0100nanda hears that he is banned from the council, he objects that he has not done anything that goes against the teaching and discipline of the Buddha. Mah\u0101kassapa then lists seven charges to counter \u0100nanda's objection. The charges are similar to the five given in P\u0101li.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}} Other textual traditions list slightly different charges, amounting to a combined total of eleven charges, some of which are only mentioned in one or two textual traditions.{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=820}} Considering that an enlightened disciple was seen to have overcome all faults, it seems more likely that the charges were laid before \u0100nanda's attainment than after.<ref name=\"Ch'en\">{{cite journal |last1=Ch'en |first1=Kenneth |title=The Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101nas\u016btra and The First Council |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |date=1958 |volume=21 |page=132 |doi=10.2307/2718621 |jstor=2718621}}</ref>\n\nIndologists von Hin\u00fcber and [[Jean Przyluski]] argue that the account of \u0100nanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the [[sutra|discourses]] ({{lang-pi|sutta|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|s\u016btra|italic=yes |link=no}}) and schools that emphasized monastic discipline.

Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}}\n\n==== Historicity ====\nTradition states that the First Council lasts for seven months.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}} Scholars doubt, however, whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council,{{sfn |Harvey |2013 |page=88}} because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gombrich |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Gombrich |title=How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings |date=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-37123-0 |pages=96{{en dash}}7 |edition=2nd}}</ref> It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the ''[[Vinaya-pitaka|Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka]]'' and ''Sutta-pi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1993 |p=69}} Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists [[Louis de La Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=226}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=453}} Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist [[Hermann Oldenberg]], considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second Council]], and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=231}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=454{{en dash}}6}} Much material in the accounts, and even more so in the more developed later accounts, deal with \u0100nanda as the unsullied intermediary who passes on the legitimate teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn |MacQueen |2005|pp=314{{en dash}}5}} On the other hand, archaeologist [[Louis Finot (archaeologist)|Louis Finot]], Indologist E.

For example, after the death of [[Mahavira|Mah\u0101vira]] and the depicted subsequent conflicts among the [[Jain]] community, \u0100nanda asks the Buddha how such problems could be prevented after the Buddha's death.{{sfn |Clasquin |2013 |page=7}}{{sfn |Gethin |2001 |page=232}}{{refn |group=note |The Buddha responds with a discussion of the role of a teacher, a student and the teaching, and concludes that he has proclaimed his teaching well.<!--232-3--> He continues that disputes about [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] are not so much a problem, but disputes about \"the path and the way\" are.<!--234-->{{sfn |Gethin |2001 |pages=232{{en dash}}4}}}} Findly argues that \u0100nanda's duty to memorize the Buddha's teachings accurately and without distortion, is \"both a gift and a burden\". \u0100nanda is able to remember many discourses verbatim, but this also goes hand-in-hand with a habit of not reflecting on those teachings, being afraid that reflection may distort the teachings as he heard them.

Prak\u1e5bti agrees, and it is revealed that the Buddha means something else than she does: he asks Prak\u1e5bti to ordain as a ''bhikkhun\u012b'', and live the celibate life as a kind of sister to \u0100nanda. Although Prak\u1e5bti at first cries of misery, after the Buddha explains that her current situation is a result of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from her previous life, she understands and rejoices in the life of a ''bhikkhun\u012b''.{{sfn |App |2011 |pages=33{{en dash}}4, 43}} Apart from the spiritual themes, Wagner also addresses the faults of the caste system by having the Buddha criticize it.<ref name=\"Wagner\">{{cite journal |date=10 August 1889 |orig-year=1856 |journal=The Musical World |volume=69 |issue=32 |page=531 |title=Sketch of Wagner's 'Die Sieger' |first=R. |last=Wagner |author-link=Richard Wagner |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222537/https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |dead-url=no |archive-date=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nDrawing from [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy, Wagner contrasts desire-driven salvation and true spiritual salvation: by seeking deliverance through the person she loves, Prak\u1e5bti only affirms her ''[[will to live]]'' ({{lang-de|Wille zum Leben|italic=yes}}), which is blocking her from attaining deliverance. By being ordained as a ''bhikkhun\u012b'' she strives for her spiritual salvation instead. Thus, the early Buddhist account of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati's ordination is replaced by that of Prak\u1e5bti. According to Wagner, by allowing Prak\u1e5bti to become ordained, the Buddha also completes his own aim in life: \"[H]e regards his existence  in the world, whose aim was to benefit all beings, as completed, since he had become able to offer deliverance{{em dash}}without mediation{{em dash}}also to woman.\"{{sfn |App |2011 |pages=34{{en dash}}5 |ps=:\"... und somit seine erl\u00f6senden, allen Wesen zugewendeten Weltlauf als volendet ansieht, da er auch dem Weibe{{em dash}}unmittelbar{{em dash}}die Erl\u00f6sung zusprechen konnte.\"}}\n\nThe same legend of \u0100nanda and Prak\u1e5bti was made into a short prose play by the Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], called ''Chandalika''.

[[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> \n\nAnaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorite]]s led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a [[Aegospotami|meteorite in 467]].<ref>Couprie, Dirk L. \"How Thales Was Able to\" Predict\" a Solar Eclipse Without the Help of Alleged Mesopotamian Wisdom.\" Early Science and Medicine 9.4 (2004): 321-337</ref> He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnese]].

He died there in around the year 428. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.\n\nAnaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century AD.\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[Image:Anaxagoras Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Anaxagoras, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nAccording to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts ({{lang|el|\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6}}) as well as heterogeneous ones.<ref name=\"smith\">\n{{Cite DGRBM |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |title=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D21%3Aentry%3Danaxagoras-bio-1}}</ref>\n\nThe work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of [[Nous|Mind or Reason]] ({{lang|el|\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}}). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Diels|editor1-first=Hermann|title=Die fragmente der Vorsokratiker griechisch und deutsch|quote=B12}}</ref> Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion.

However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character.<ref name=\"smith\"/> Out of this process arise the things we see in this world.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\n==Literary references==\nAnaxagoras is mentioned by [[Socrates]] during his trial in [[Plato]]'s \"[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]\".  In the [[Phaedo]], Plato portrays Socrates saying of Anaxagoras that as a young man: 'I eagerly acquired his books and read them as quickly as I could' <ref>Plato, Phaedo, 85b</ref>.\n\nIn a quote chosen to begin [[Nathanael West]]'s first book \"[[The Dream Life of Balso Snell]]\", [[Marcel Proust]]'s character Bergotte says, \"After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey.\"\n\nAnaxagoras appears as a character in ''[[Faust, Part Two|Faust, Part II]]'' by [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].\n\nAnaxagoras appears as a character in ''The Ionia Sanction'', by [[Gary Corby]].\n\nAnaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'', by [[Gore Vidal]]. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:\n\n:[According to Anaxagoras] One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the sky, landing near [[Aegospotami]] in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy in the Agora for a drachma.<ref>Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002)</ref>\n\n[[William H. Gass]] begins his novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: \"The descent to hell is the same from every place.\"\n\nHe is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow) It reads: \"Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself?\"\n\n[[Dante Alighieri]] places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto IV, line 118).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anaxagoras (crater)]] on the Moon\n* [[Squaring the circle]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Copleston |first1=Frederick Charles |authorlink1=Frederick Copleston |title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 1 Greece and Rome (reprint) |chapter=IX: The Advance of Anaxagoras |date=2003 |publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0826468956|ref=harv}}\n\n===Editions of the Fragments===\n* Curd, Patricia (ed.), ''Anaxagoras of Clazomenae.

[[Quintilian]] seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in ''Institutio Oratoria'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082137/http://honeyl.public.iastate.edu/quintilian/3/chapter4.html#9 3.4.9], as the Italian Renaissance philologist [[Piero Vettori]] first recognized.

''Helen'' 14).  [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Jebb]] entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the ''[[Encomium of Helen]]'' ascribed to [[Gorgias]]: \"It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias.\"<ref>R.C.

The \"ethical\" fragments preserved in [[Stobaeus]]' ''Florilegium'' may represent \"some philosophical book.\"<ref name=Mahaffy/>\n\n==Historical works==\nAnaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of [[Epaminondas]] at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] (''Hellenica'', {{lang-grc|\u03a0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9}}), and a history of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] (''Philippica'').

The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]].<ref>Guthrie, W.K.C. \"The Milesians: Anaximenes.\" ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116.</ref> When air condenses it becomes visible, as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation. As the condensed air cools Anaximenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones. In contrast, water evaporates into air,<!--can see how he thought that, the water disappears...--> which ignites and produces flame<!--...but what is this supposed to be based on?--> when further rarefied.<ref name=\"guthrie124\">Guthrie, W.K.C. \"The Milesians: Anaximenes.\" ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 124-126.</ref>  While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot/dry and cold/wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the Milesian [[material monism|monistic system]].<ref name=\"guthrie124\"/><ref>Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield. \"Anaximenes of Miletus.\" ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984. 146.</ref>\n\n==The origin of the Cosmos==\nHaving concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies.  Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air. In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars. While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars, but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.<ref>Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield. \"Anaximenes of Miletus.\" ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  152-153.</ref> Similarly, he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air. In his theory, when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth, but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant. Anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.<ref name=\"graham\"/><ref>Fairbanks, Arthur. \"[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/TEACH/28000/DavisUniversal.pdf Anaximenes]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\". ''The First Philosophers of Greece''. K. Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1898. 20.</ref>\n\n==Other phenomena==\nAnaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well. [[Earthquake]]s, he asserted, were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of superabundance of water, which also causes cracks in the earth. In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks, so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes. [[Lightning]] is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind, creating a bright, fire-like flash. [[Rainbow]]s, on the other hand, are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun.<ref>Fairbanks, Arthur.  \"[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/TEACH/28000/DavisUniversal.pdf Anaximenes]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\". ''The First Philosophers of Greece''. K. Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1898. 18;20-21.</ref>  These examples show how Anaximenes, like the other [[Milesian school|Milesian philosophers]], looked for the broader picture in nature. They sought unifying causes for diversely occurring events, rather than treating each one on a case-by-case basis, or attributing them to gods or to a personified [[nature]].<ref name=\"lindberg29\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Anaximenes (crater)|Anaximenes]] crater on the [[Moon]] is named in his honor.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Jonathan|title=The Presocratic Philosophers |location=London|publisher=Routledge|year= 1982}}\n* {{cite book |authorlink=John Burnet (classicist)|last=Burnet|first=John |title=Early Greek Philosophy |url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/index.htm |edition=3rd |location=London|publisher=Black|year=1920}}\n* {{cite book | last=Freeman | first=Kathleen | title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers  | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1978 | isbn=0-674-03500-3}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink= W.

The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands. When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the [[fetial]]s.<ref name=\"Livy1:32\"/>\n\nAncus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of [[Politorium]] (situated near the town of [[Lanuvium]]) by storm. Its residents were removed to settle on the [[Aventine Hill]] in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the [[Sabines]] and [[Alba Longa|Albans]]. When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.<ref name=\"Livy1:33\"/> The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished.\n\nThe war then focused on the Latin town of [[Medullia]]. The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified. Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious. Ancus returned to Rome with a large amount of loot. More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the [[Palatine Hill]], by the temple of [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]]. \nAncus Marcius incorporated the [[Janiculum]] into the city, fortifying it with a wall and connecting it with the city by a wooden bridge across the [[Tiber]],<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ancus Marcius|volume=1|page=953}}</ref> the [[Pons Sublicius]].  \nOn the land side of the city he constructed the [[Fossa Quiritium]], a ditch fortification.  He also built Rome's first prison, the [[Mamertine Prison|Mamertine prison]].<ref name=\"Livy1:33\"/>\n\nHe extended Roman territory to the sea, founding the port of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]], establishing salt-works around the port,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and taking the Silva Maesia, an area of coastal forest north of the [[Tiber]], from the [[Veii|Veientes]]. \nHe expanded the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Feretrius]] to reflect these territorial successes.<ref name=\"Livy1:33\"/> \nAccording to a reconstruction of the [[Fasti Triumphales]], Ancus Marcius celebrated at least one triumph, over the [[Sabines]] and Veientes.\n\n==Death and Successor==\nAncus Marcius is reported to have died of natural causes in the 24th year of his reign, at the age of 60.<ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''[[Historiae Romanae Breviarium (Eutropius)|Historiae Romanae Breviarium]]''</ref>\n\nAncus Marcius was succeeded by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], who was ultimately assassinated by the sons of Ancus Marcius.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''</ref> Later, during the Republic and the Empire, the prominent [[Marcia (gens)|Gens Marcia]] claimed descent from Ancus Marcius.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-reg | leg }}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Tullus Hostilius]] }}\n{{s-ttl | title  = [[King of Rome]] | years = 642\u2013617 BC }}\n{{s-aft | after  = [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Kings of Rome}}\n{{Roman religion}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marcius, Ancus}}\n[[Category:670s BC births]]\n[[Category:617 BC deaths]]\n[[Category:7th-century BC Romans]]\n[[Category:7th-century BC Kings of Rome]]\n[[Category:Kings of Rome]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Marcii]]", "sha1": "gp0e3p3gxsbfg5qiw5tb6o2t0abgz8n"}}, {"title": "Andaman Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "1750", "revision": {"id": "866598896", "parentid": "864449434", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T10:25:37Z", "contributor": {"ip": "117.199.13.92"}, "comment": "/* Transportation */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox islands\n| name             = Andaman Islands\n| native name      = <!-- or local name to remove the \"native name:\" prefix -->\n| sobriquet        = <!-- or nickname -->\n| image name       = Andaman Islands.PNG\n| image size       = \n| image caption    = Location of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.\n| image alt        = \n| map caption      = \n| location         = [[Bay of Bengal]]\n| coordinates      = {{Coord|12|30|N|92|45|E|region:IN_type:isle|display=inline,title}}\n| archipelago      = [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]\n| total islands    = 572\n| major islands    = [[North Andaman Island]], [[Little Andaman]], [[Middle Andaman Island]], [[South Andaman Island]]\n| area km2         = 6,408\n| area footnotes   = \n| rank             = \n| length km        = <!-- or length m  -->\n| length footnotes = \n| width km         = <!-- or width m  -->\n| width footnotes  =\n| coastline km     = <!-- or coastline m  -->\n| coastline footnotes = \n| elevation m      = 732\n| elevation footnotes = \n| highest mount    = Saddle Peak\n| country          = India\n| country admin divisions title     = Union territory\n| country admin divisions           = [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]\n| country admin divisions title 1   = \n| country admin divisions 1         = \n| country admin divisions title 2   = \n| country admin divisions 2         = \n| country capital                   = [[Port Blair]]\n| country largest city              = \n| country largest city population   = \n| country leader title              = \n| country leader name               = \n| demonym           = \n| population        = [http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/prov_data_products_ani.html 343,125]\n| population as of  = 2011\n| density km2       = 48\n| density footnotes = \n| ethnic groups     = [[Shompen]]<br/> [[Indian people|Mainland Indians]]<br/>[[Jarawa people (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]]<br/>[[Onge people|Onge]]<br/>[[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]]<br/>[[Yashiha People|Yashiha]]<br/>[[Great Andamanese people|Great Andamanese]]\n| timezone1         = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1       = +5:30\n| timezone1_DST     = {{nowrap|not observed}}\n| utc_offset1_DST   = +5:30\n| website           = {{URL|http://www.and.nic.in}}\n| additional info   = \n}}\n[[File:Andaman nicobar 76.jpg|thumb|Detailed map of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]\n\nThe '''Andaman Islands''' form an [[archipelago]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] between [[India]], to the west, and [[Myanmar]], to the north and east.

George Routledge and Sons, London.</ref> In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary.

Today, a memorial stands in Andaman Water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the great Andamanese tribe stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe.<ref name=\"Rapidiq\">{{cite web|url=https://rapidiq.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/the-rise-and-the-fall-of-the-great-andamanese/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Andamanese|work=Confessions of a Linguist!}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"One India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2007/05/17/who-are-heroes-of-battle-of-aberdeen-1179405748.html|title=Who are heroes of Battle of Aberdeen?|work=www.oneindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Andaman Sheekha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.andamansheekha.com/2012/05/16/tribute-at-the-memorial-of-battle-of-aberdeen-today/|title=Tribute at the Memorial of \"Battle of Aberdeen\" Today|author =sanjib|work=andamansheekha.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, the ship ''Nineveh'' wrecked on the reef of [[North Sentinel Island]].

He was one of the ten [[Attic orators]] included in the \"Alexandrian Canon\" compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in the third century BC.\n\n==Life==\nAndocides was the son of Leogoras, and was born in [[Athens]] around 440 BC.<ref>''Brill's New Pauly'' v.Andocides</ref> He belonged to the ancient [[Eupatrid]] family of the [[Kerykes]], who traced their lineage up to [[Odysseus]] and the god [[Hermes]].<ref name=\"pseudo\">[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], ''[[Lives of the Ten Orators]]''</ref><ref name=\"pa\">[[Plutarch]], ''Alcibiades'' 21</ref><ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 141</ref><ref>Andocides, ''De Reditu'' \u00a7 26</ref>\n\nIn Andocides' youth, he seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to [[Thessaly]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Molossia]], [[Thesprotia]], [[Italy]], and [[Sicily]].<ref>Andocides, ''Contra Alcibiadem'' \u00a7 41</ref> And although he was frequently attacked for his political opinions,<ref>Andocides, ''Contra Alcibiadem'' \u00a7 8</ref> he maintained his ground until, in 415, when he became involved in the charge brought against [[Alcibiades]] for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the [[Herma|Herms]] on the eve of the departure of the [[Sicilian expedition|Athenian expedition]] against [[Sicily]]. It appeared particularly likely that Andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes, which was believed to be a preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution, since the Herm standing close to his house in the [[phyle]] Aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured.<ref>[[Cornelius Nepos]], ''Alcibiades'' 3</ref><ref>Jan Otto Sluiter, ''lectiones Andocideae'' c. 3.</ref>\n\nAndocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison, but after some time recovered his freedom by a promise that he would turn informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime; and on the suggestion of one Charmides or Timaeus,<ref name=\"pa\"/><ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 48</ref> he mentioned four, all of whom were put to death. He is said to have also denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries, but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger - a charge he strenuously denied.<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis''</ref> But as Andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge, he was deprived of his rights as a citizen, and left Athens.<ref>Andocides, ''De Reditu'' \u00a7 25</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAndocides traveled about in various parts of Greece, and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful people.<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 137</ref> The means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind; among which a service he rendered to a prince in [[Cyprus]] is mentioned in particular.<ref name=\"phot\">[[Photios I of Constantinople]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]''</ref>\n\nIn 411, Andocides returned to Athens on the establishment of the [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] government of the [[The Four Hundred (oligarchy)|Four Hundred]], hoping that a certain service  he had rendered the Athenian ships at Samos would secure him a welcome reception.<ref>Andocides, ''De Reditu'' \u00a7\u00a7 11,12</ref> But no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of Andocides, than their leader [[Peisander]] had him seized, and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at Samos. During his trial, Andocides, who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him, leaped to the altar which stood in the court, and there assumed the attitude of a supplicant. This saved his life, but he was imprisoned. Soon afterwards, however, he was set free, or escaped from prison.<ref>Andocides, ''De Reditu'' \u00a7 15</ref><ref name=\"lysias29\">[[Lysias]], ''Against Andocides'' \u00a7 29</ref>\n\nAndocides then went to Cyprus, where for a time he enjoyed the friendship of [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]]; but, by some circumstance or other, he exasperated his friend, and was consigned to prison. Here again he escaped, and after the restoration of democracy in Athens and the abolition of the Four Hundred, he ventured once more to return to Athens; but as he was still suffering under a sentence of civil disenfranchisement, he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the [[prytaneis]] to allow him to attend the assembly of the people. The latter, however, expelled him from the city.<ref name=\"lysias29\"/> It was on this occasion, in 411, that Andocides delivered the speech still extant \"On his return\", on which he petitioned for permission to reside at Athens, but in vain. In his third exile, Andocides went to reside in [[Elis]],<ref name=\"phot\"/> and during the time of his absence from his native city, his house there was occupied by [[Cleophon (politician)|Cleophon]], the leading [[demagogue]].<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 146</ref>\n\nAndocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of [[Thirty Tyrants|the Thirty]] by [[Thrasybulus]], when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also. He himself says that he returned to Athens from Cyprus,<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 132</ref> where he claimed to have great influence and considerable property.<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 4</ref> Because of the general amnesty, he was allowed to remain at Athens, enjoyed peace for the next three years, and soon recovered an influential position. According to [[Lysias]], it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against [[Archippus]] or [[Aristippus]], which, however, he dropped on receiving a sum of money. During this period Andocides became a member of the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]], in which he appears to have possessed a great influence, as well as in the popular assembly. He was [[gymnasiarch]] at the [[Hephaestaea]], was sent as [[architheorus]] to the [[Isthmian Games]] and [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury.\n\nBut in 400, [[Callias]], supported by [[Cephisius]], [[Agyrrhius]], [[Meletus]], and [[Epichares]], urged the necessity of preventing Andocides from attending the assembly, as he had never been formally freed from the civil disenfranchisement. Callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at [[Eleusis]].<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 110</ref> The orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant \"on the Mysteries\" (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd), in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms, that he had not violated the laws of the temple at Eleusis, that anyway he had received his citizenship back as a result of the amnesty, and that Callias was really motivated by a private dispute with Andocides over inheritance. He was acquitted. After this, he again enjoyed peace until 394, he was sent as ambassador to [[Sparta]] respecting the peace to be concluded in consequence of [[Conon]]'s victory off [[Cnidus]]. On his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy. The speech \"On the peace with the Lacedaemons\" (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2), which is still extant, refers to this affair. It was delivered in 393 (though some scholars place it in 391). Andocides was found guilty, and sent into exile for the fourth time. He never returned afterwards, and seems to have died soon after this blow.\n\nAndocides appears to have fathered no children, since he is described at the age of 70 as being childless,<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7\u00a7 146,148</ref> although the [[scholiast]] on [[Aristophanes]] mentions [[Antiphon]] as a son of Andocides. The large fortune which he had inherited from his father, or acquired in his commercial undertakings, was greatly diminished in the latter years of his life.<ref>Andocides, ''De Mysteriis'' \u00a7 144</ref><ref>[[Lysias]], ''Against Andocides'' \u00a7 31</ref>\n\n==Oratory==\nAs an orator Andocides does not appear to have been held in very high esteem by the ancients, as he is seldom mentioned, though [[Valerius Theon]] is said to have written a commentary on his orations.<ref>[[Suda]], ''s.v.'' \u0398\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd</ref> We do not hear of his having been trained in any of the sophistical schools of the time, and he had probably developed his talents in the practical school of the popular assembly. Hence his orations have no mannerism in them, and are really, as Plutarch says, simple and free from all rhetorical pomp and ornament.<ref>Comp. Dionys. Hal. ''de Lys.'' 2, ''de Thucyd. Jud.'' 51</ref>\n\nSometimes, however, his style is diffuse, and becomes tedious and obscure. The best among his orations is that on the Mysteries; but, for the history of the time, all are of the highest importance.\n\nBesides the three orations already mentioned, which are undoubtedly genuine, there is a fourth against Alcibiades (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f08\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03b2\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5), said to have been delivered by Andocides during the [[ostracism]] of 415; but it is probably spurious, though it appears to contain genuine historical matter. Some scholars ascribed it to [[Phaeax (orator)|Phaeax]], who took part in the ostracism, according to Plutarch. But it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century BC, since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of Alcibiades was a standing rhetorical theme.<ref>Gribble. 1999. ''Alcibiades and Athens'' ch.2 app.2</ref> Besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orations.<ref>Jan Otto Sluiter, ''lectiones Andocideae'' p. 239, &c.</ref>\n\n==List of extant speeches==\n#[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Andoc.+1+1 On the Mysteries] ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd}} \"''De Mysteriis''\").

He ruled the [[Principality of Halych]] from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered [[Principality of Halych]] in 1188. Andrew's rule was unpopular, and the [[boyar]]s (or noblemen) expelled him. B\u00e9la III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King [[Emeric of Hungary]], to cede [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102\u20131526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied [[Zachlumia|Hum]].\n\nDespite the fact that Andrew did not stop conspiring against Emeric, the dying king made Andrew guardian of his son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], in 1204. After the premature death of Ladislaus, Andrew ascended the throne in 1205. According to historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kontler, \"[i]t was amidst the socio-political turmoil during [Andrew's] reign that the relations, arrangements, institutional framework and social categories that arose under Stephen I, started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society\" in Hungary.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}} Andrew introduced a new grants policy, the so-called \"new institutions\", giving away money and royal estates to his partisans despite the loss of royal revenues. He was the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of \"King of Halych and [[Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia|Lodomeria]]\". He waged at least a dozen wars to seize the two [[Rus' principalities]], but the local [[boyar]]s and neighboring princes prevented him from conquering the principalities. He participated in the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the Holy Land in 1217\u20131218, but the crusade was a failure.\n\nWhen the ''[[servientes regis]]'', or \"royal servants\", rose up, Andrew was forced to issue the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], confirming their privileges. This led to the rise of the [[nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary]]. His ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' of 1224 listed the liberties of the [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community. The employment of [[Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny|Muslims]] to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the [[Holy See]] and the Hungarian [[prelate]]s. Andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non-Christian officials in 1233, but he never fulfilled the latter promise.\n\nAndrew's first wife, [[Gertrude of Merania]], was murdered in 1213, because her blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords. The veneration of their daughter, [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], was confirmed by the Holy See during Andrew's lifetime. After Andrew's death, his sons, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la]] and [[Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria|Coloman]], accused his third wife, [[Beatrice d'Este, Queen of Hungary|Beatrice d'Este]], of adultery and never considered her son, [[Stephen the Posthumous|Stephen]], to be a legitimate son of Andrew.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and youth ({{circa}} 1177\u20131197)===\n\nAndrew was the second son of King [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III]] and B\u00e9la's first wife, [[Agnes of Antioch]].{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}} The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}}{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994|p=43}}{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2012|p=86}} Andrew was first mentioned in connection to his father's invasion of the [[Principality of Halych]] in 1188.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229}} That year, B\u00e9la III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, [[Vladimir II Yaroslavich]], who had been expelled by his subjects.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=191}} B\u00e9la forced the new prince, [[Roman Mstislavich]], to flee.

[[philosopher]] [[David Hume]], published in English in 1748.<ref>See {{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David |author-link= David Hume|year=1748 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding |edition= 1 |publisher= A.

Hume was disappointed with the reception of the ''Treatise'', which \"fell dead-born from the press,\"<ref>Hume, David (1776), ''My Own Life'', Appendix A of [[Ernest Campbell Mossner]], ''The Life of David Hume'', University of Texas Press, 1954.</ref> as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.\n\nThe end product of his labours was the ''Enquiry''. The ''Enquiry'' dispensed with much of the material from the ''Treatise'', in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on [[personal identity]] do not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the role of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] in a theory of knowledge, are retained.\n\nThis book has proven highly influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today. [[Immanuel Kant]] points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described \"dogmatic slumber.\"<ref>I. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] \"[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]\"</ref> The ''Enquiry'' is widely regarded as a classic in [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophical]] literature.\n\n==Summary==\nThe argument of the ''Enquiry'' proceeds by a series of incremental steps, separated into chapters which logically succeed one another. After expounding his [[epistemology]], Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics.\n\n===Empirical epistemology===\n\n====1. ''Of the different species of philosophy''====\n\nIn the first section of the Enquiry, Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, as he calls it, \"moral philosophy\"). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.\n\n====2. ''Of the origin of ideas''====\n\nNext, Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas. By \"impressions\", he means sensations, while by \"ideas\", he means memories and imaginings. According to Hume, the difference between the two is that ideas are less ''vivacious'' than impressions. For example, the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression (or sensation) of actually eating one. Writing within the tradition of [[empiricism]], he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas.\n\nHume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation, or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation.<ref>In Locke's terminology, this was known as the division between ''simple and complex'' ideas of sense.</ref> According to Hume, the creative faculty makes use of (at least) four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense-impressions. These operations are ''compounding'' (or the addition of one idea onto another, such as a horn on a horse to create a [[unicorn]]); ''transposing'' (or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a [[centaur]]); ''augmenting'' (as with the case of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]], whose size has been augmented); and ''diminishing'' (as with [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]], whose size has been diminished). (Hume 1974:317) In a later chapter, he also mentions the operations of ''mixing'', ''separating'', and ''dividing''. (Hume 1974:340) [[File:Missing blue shade.svg|thumb|Fig. 1. The Missing Shade of Blue]]\n\nHowever, Hume admits that there is one objection to his account: the problem of ''\"[[The Missing Shade of Blue]]\"''. In this thought-experiment, he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one (see Fig. 1). He predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue, despite the fact that he has never experienced it. This seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account, though Hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions. (Hume 1974:319)\n\n====3. ''Of the association of ideas''====\n\nIn this chapter, Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: ''resemblance'', ''contiguity'' in space-time, and ''cause-and-effect''. He argues that there must be some ''universal principle'' that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas. However, he does not immediately show what this principle might be. (Hume 1974:320-321)\n\n====4. ''Sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding (in two parts)''====\n\nIn the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either \"relations of ideas\" or \"matters of fact\", which is roughly the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction]] between [[logical truth|analytic]] and [[fact|synthetic propositions]]. The former, he tells the reader, are proved by demonstration, while the latter are given through experience. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning. For Hume, every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily\u2014they are entirely distinct from one another. (Hume 1974:324)\n\nIn part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:\n\n::\"When it is asked, ''What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact?'' the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, ''What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation?'' it may be replied in one word, ''experience''. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, ''What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience?'' this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.\" (Hume 1974:328)\n\nHe shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since \"it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change\") nor experience (since that would be a [[circular argument]]). (Hume 1974:330-332) Here he is describing what would become known as the [[problem of induction]].\n\n====5. ''Sceptical solution of these doubts (in two parts)''====\n\nFor Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of ''habit or custom'', which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the \"principle\" that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, one of the many famous passages of the ''Enquiry'' is on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. In Section XII, ''Of the academical or sceptical philosophy'', Hume will argue, \n\n::''\"The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action, and employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals.\"'' (Hume 1974:425)\n\nIn the second part, he provides an account of beliefs. He explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesn't. (Hume 1974:340)\n\n====6. ''Of probability''====\n\nThis short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance. For him, \"probability\" means a ''higher chance'' of occurring, and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer. By \"chance\", he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience. However, further experience takes these equal chances, and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others. These gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes. This effect may be understood as another case of ''custom or habit'' taking past experience and using it to predict the future. (Hume 1974:346-348)\n\n===Applied epistemology===\n\n====1. ''Of the idea of necessary connection (in two parts)''====\n\n[[File:Nicolas Malebranche.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Nicolas Malebranche]], one of Hume's philosophical opponents]]\n\nBy \"necessary connection\", Hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another. He rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the \"muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits\" which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere [[Occasionalism|occasions of the will of some god(s)]], a view associated with the philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. (Hume 1974:356-359)\n\nHaving dispensed with these alternative explanations, he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of ''observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances''. In this way, people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit, and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will. (Hume 1974:361)\n\n====2. ''Of liberty and necessity (in two parts)''====\n\nHere Hume tackles the problem of how [[liberty]] may be reconciled with [[metaphysical necessity]] (otherwise known as a [[compatibilist]] formulation of [[free will]]). Hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments\u2014that is to say, arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions. He first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic, but human actions are more controversial. However, he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system. To show the compatibility of necessity and liberty, Hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one's will e.g. the capacity to will one's actions but not to will one's will. He then shows (quite briefly) how determinism and free will are compatible notions, and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life.\n\n====3. ''Of the reason of animals (comparable to man)''====\n\nHume insists that the conclusions of the Enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans. He believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do: through learned expectations. (Hume 1974:384) He also notes that this \"inferential\" ability that animals have is not through reason, but custom alone. Hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share, namely, the ability to reason experimentally (through custom). Nevertheless, he admits, humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways, including: differences in memory and attention, inferential abilities, ability to make deductions in a long chain, ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly, the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances, a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations, a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with, an ability to detach oneself and scrap one's own biases, and an ability to converse through language (and thus gain from the experience of others' testimonies). (Hume 1974:385, footnote 17.)\n\n====4. ''Of miracles (in two parts)''====\n{{Main article|Of Miracles}}\nThe next topic which Hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony, and of the role that [[social epistemology|testimony plays a part in epistemology]]. This was not an idle concern for Hume. Depending on its outcome, the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles.\n\nTrue to his empirical thesis, Hume tells the reader that, though testimony does have some force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389)\n\nAnd there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony, also based on experience. If a) testimonies conflict one another, b) there are a small number of witnesses, c) the speaker has no integrity, d) the speaker is overly hesitant or bold, or e) the speaker is known to have motives for lying, then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speaker's claims. (Hume 1974:390)\n\nThere is one final criterion that Hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony, and that is f) if the propositions being communicated are miraculous. Hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature. He argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them, and are so well demonstrated to everyone's experience, that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence. (Hume 1974:391-392)\n\nMoreover, he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity, for four reasons. First, he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts. Second, he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder, and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others. Third, he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism. Finally, since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous\u2014that is, one man's religious miracle may be contradicted by another man's miracle\u2014any testimony relating to the fantastic is self-denunciating. (Hume 1974:393-398)\n\nStill, Hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence, so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform. However, he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity. Thus, if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600, then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws, we'd come to accept it as a fact. But if every historian were to assert that Queen Elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral, and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead, then we'd have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation. (Hume 1974:400-402)\n\n====5. ''Of a particular providence and of a future state''====\n\nHume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell. The brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions, not of Hume, but of one of Hume's anonymous friends, who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher [[Epicurus]]. His friend argues that, though it is possible to [[abductive reasoning|trace a cause from an effect]], it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced. The friend insists, then, that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things\u2014God\u2014we can't infer anything about the afterlife, because we don't know anything of the afterlife from experience, and we can't infer it from the existence of God. (Hume 1974:408)\n\nHume offers his friend an objection: if we see an unfinished building, then can't we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions, and that it will be finished in the future? His friend concurs, but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we can't pretend to know the contents of the mind of God, while we can know the designs of other humans. Hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend's reasoning. (Hume 1974:412-414)\n\n====6. ''Of the academical or skeptical philosophy (in three parts)''====\n\nThe first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments. The treatment includes the arguments of atheism, Cartesian skepticism, \"light\" skepticism, and rationalist critiques of empiricism. Hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which - while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable - may only be combated through the non-philosophical adherence to custom or habit. He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies.\n\nIn the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it.\n\n::\"For here is the chief and most confounding objection to ''excessive'' skepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigor. We need only ask such a skeptic, ''What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches?'' He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer... a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: or if it had, that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge anything, that all human life must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail.\" (Hume 1974:426)\n\nHe concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all. \"''When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, ''Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?'' No. ''Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?'' No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.''\"<ref>Hume, D., ''Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals'' Reprinted from 1777 edition, Third Edition, L. A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford, Sect. XII, Part III, p.165.</ref>\n\n==Critiques and rejoinders==\nThe criteria Hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology, under the rubric of the communication-persuasion paradigm. Supporting literature includes: the work of [[social impact theory]], which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence; as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator [[credibility]] in different kinds of persuasion; and examinations of the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]worthiness of the speaker.\n\nThe \"custom\" view of learning can in many ways be likened to [[associationist]] psychology. This point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century. Still, testing on the subject has been somewhat divided. Testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect. However, it has been shown that some animals, like chimpanzees, were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals, and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere custom.<ref>Kohler, Wolfgang.

Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of [[Syria]]. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother Jacques (also a Dominican) and several others \u2013 John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert \"Le [[Sommelier]]\", Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}\n\nThe party set out on 16 February 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}}\n\nOn arrival at the supreme Mongol court \u2013 either that on the [[Emil River|Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] \u2013 Andrew found G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the \"Camus\" of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had quit \"Tartary\" [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], G\u00fcy\u00fck's successor, had been elected.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|pp=972\u2013973}}\n\nAndrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Mongols]]' homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host) are based on fact.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}\n\nMounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of \"Tartary\" (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], \"''se repenti fort''\" (\"felt very sorry\").{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}}\n\n==Death==\nThe date and location of Andrew's death is unknown.<ref name=\"Dorcy1990\">{{cite book|last=Dorcy|first=Sr. Mary Jean|title=St. Dominic's Family: Over 300 Famous Dominicans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL-cCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=24 November 1990|publisher=TAN Books|isbn=9781505103465|page=62}}</ref>\n\nWe only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv.

His father, [[Michael IX Palaiologos]], began reigning in full imperial style as co-emperor circa 1295.\n\nIn March 1318, Andronikos married [[Irene of Brunswick]], daughter of [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen]]. In circa 1321 she gave birth to a son, who died in infancy.\n\nIn 1320, Andronikos accidentally caused the death of his brother Manuel, after which their father, co-emperor [[Michael IX Palaiologos]], died in his grief.  The homicide and the general dissolute behavior of Andronikos III and his coterie, mostly the young scions of the great aristocratic clans of the Empire, resulted in a deep rift in the relations between young Andronikos and his grandfather, still reigning as Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]].\n\nEmperor Andronikos II disowned his grandson Andronikos, who then fled the capital and rallied his supporters in [[Thrace]] and began to reign as rival emperor in 1321.  Andronikos then waged the intermittent [[Byzantine civil war of 1321\u201328]] against his reigning grandfather, who granted him to reign as co-emperor Andronikos III.\n\nEmpress Irene died on 16/17 August 1324 with no surviving child.  [[Theodora Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Theodora Palaiologina]], sister of Andronikos III, married the new tsar [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria]] in 1324. Andronikos III, then a widower, married [[Anna of Savoy]] in October 1326.  In 1327 she gave birth to Maria (renamed Irene) Palaiologina.\n\nAndronikos III concluded the [[Treaty of Chernomen]] of 1327, an alliance with tsar Michael Shishman of Bulgaria against [[Stephen Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski of Serbia]].  The Byzantine civil war flared again and ultimately led to the deposition in 1328 of Emperor Andronikos II, who retired to a monastery.\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Military history===\nOttoman Turks besieged [[Nicaea]] in Asia Minor, historically the provisional capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the Fourth Crusade until the Byzantine recapture of Constantinople.  Andronikos III launched a relief attempt, which Ottoman sultan [[Orhan]] defeated at the [[Battle of Pelekanon]] on 10 or 15 June 1329. Nevertheless, Andronikos III effected the recovery of [[Lordship of Chios]] (including [[Lesbos]]) from [[Martino Zaccaria]] in a naval battle, also in 1329.\n\nAn alliance with Bulgaria failed to secure any gains for the Byzantine empire. On 28 July 1330, the Serbians decisively defeated the Bulgarians in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] (modern [[Kyustendil]], Bulgaria) without significant Byzantine participation.  The Ottomans continued to advance in 1331, finally taking [[Nicaea]] (renamed [[\u0130znik]]).  Andronikos III wanted [[Nicomedia]] and the other few Byzantine forts in [[Anatolia]] not to suffer the same fate and sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute.\n\nAndronikos III reorganized and attempted to strengthen the weakened [[Byzantine navy]], which comprised only 10 ships by 1332; in emergencies, he still could muster a hundred extra merchant ships.\n\nTo overcome his failure to secure gains against the Serbians, Andronikos III attempted to annex Bulgarian Thrace, but the new tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] defeated Byzantine forces at [[Battle of Rusokastro]] on 18 July 1332.  Territorial concessions and a diplomatic marriage between the son of the Bulgarian emperor, the future [[Michael Asen IV of Bulgaria]], and Maria (renamed Irene) Palaiologina, daughter of Andronikos III Palaiologos, secured peace with Bulgaria.\n\nThe Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Constantinople towards the end of 1332 and mentions meeting Andronikos III in his memoirs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=131\u2013132}}</ref>  Byzantine sources do not attest to the meeting.\n\n[[Stephen Gabrielopoulos]], ruler over [[Thessaly]], died circa 1333; taking advantage of the secession crisis, Andronikos III extended Byzantine control over the region.\n\n[[Syrgiannes Palaiologos]], entrusted with the governorship of [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], deserted to the side of king [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia]] and aided their advance in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].  He led the Serbians to take [[Kastoria]], [[Ohrid]], [[Prilep]], [[Strumica]], and possibly [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] circa 1334 and advanced as far as Thessalonica.  Byzantine general Sphrantzes Palaiologos, posing as a deserter, entered the Serbian camp and killed Syrgiannes Palaiologos, ending his advance and bringing the Serbian army into disarray.<ref>Norwich, John Julius.

''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'' p. 284</ref>\n\nAndronikos III meanwhile effected the recovery of [[Phocaea]] in 1334 from the last Genoese governor, [[Domenico Cattaneo]]. However, this victory failed to stem significantly the Ottoman advance in Asia Minor. Byzantine rule gradually vanished from Anatolia as tribute failed to appease Ottoman sultan [[Orhan]], who took [[Nicomedia]] (renamed [[\u0130zmit]]) in 1337, leaving only [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelpheia]] and a handful of ports under Byzantine control.\n\nDespite these troubles, Andronikos III took advantage of a secession crisis in [[Despotate of Epirus]] to seize Byzantine control from [[Nikephoros II Orsini]] in 1337.\n\n===Domestic policy===\n[[John Kantakouzenos]], ''[[megas domestikos]]'' of Andronikos III and later emperor, wielded effective administrative authority during the reign, while the Emperor personally enjoyed hunting and waging war.\n\nAndronikos III also reformed the judiciary through his creation of a panel of four judges, designated \"[[Universal Justices of the Romans]]\".{{sfn|PLP|loc=21437. \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 III. \u0394\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}\n\n==Family==\nAndronikos III was first married in 1318 with [[Irene of Brunswick]], daughter of [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]; she died in 1324. They had an unnamed son, who died shortly after birth in 1321.\n\nIn 1326, Andronikos III married as his second wife [[Anna of Savoy]], daughter of [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] and of his second wife [[Marie of Brabant, Countess of Savoy]].  Their marriage produced several children, including:\n\n* [[Maria-Irene Palaiologina|Maria (renamed Eirene) Palaiologina]], who married [[Michael Asen IV of Bulgaria]]\n* [[John V Palaiologos]] (born 18 June 1332)\n* [[Michael Palaiologos (son of Andronikos III)|Michael Palaiologos]], ''[[despotes]]'' (designated successor)\n* Eirene (renamed Maria) Palaiologina, who married [[Francesco I Gattilusio]].\n\nAccording to Byzantine historian [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], Andronikos also had an illegitimate daughter, [[Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond]], who married emperor [[Basil of Trebizond]] and took over the throne of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] from 1340 to 1341.<ref>William Miller, ''Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461'', 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 46</ref>\n\nIn his ''Dictionnaire historique et G\u00e9n\u00e9alogique des grandes familles de Gr\u00e8ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983), Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza mentions a second illegitimate daughter of Andronikos, who converted (likely under duress) to [[Islam]] under the name Bayalun as one among several wives of [[\u00d6z Beg Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]].<ref>Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, ''Dictionnaire historique et G\u00e9n\u00e9alogique des grandes familles de Gr\u00e8ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983), page 373</ref> This daughter is also earlier mentioned in the 14th century traveller [[Ibn Battuta]]'s work ''The Travels'',<ref>Ibn Battutah, ''The Travels of Ibn Battutah'', Pan Macmillan; New Ed edition (June 1, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0330418799}}</ref> in which Ibn Battuta claimed that he had accompanied Bayalun traveling from Khan's court to [[Constantinople]]. Detlev Schwennicke does not include this daughter in ''[[Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln]]: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ\u00e4ischen Staaten'' (1978), and the theory of her existence may reflect theories of Sturdza.\n\n==Succession and legacy==\nAndronikos III died at [[Constantinople]], aged 44, on 15 June 1341, possibly due to chronic [[malaria]].{{sfn|Lascaratos|Marketos|1997|pp=106\u2013109}}  Historians contend that his reign ended with the Byzantine Empire in a still-tenable situation and generally do not implicate deficiencies in his leadership in its later demise. [[John V Palaiologos]] succeeded his father as Byzantine emperor, but at only 9 years of age, he required a regent.\n\nThe energetic campaigns of emperor Andronikos III simply lacked sufficient strength to defeat the imperial enemies and led to several significant Byzantine reverses at the hands of Bulgarians, Serbians, and Ottomans.  Andronikos III nevertheless provided active leadership and cooperated with able administrators. The empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkans and Greek peninsula after the Fourth Crusade. The loss of a few imperial territories in Anatolia, however, left the Ottoman Turks poised to expand into Europe.\n\nWithin a few months after the death of Andronikos III, controversy over the right to exercise the regency over the new emperor John V Palaiologos and the position of John Kantakouzenos as all-powerful chief minister and friend of Andronikos led to the outbreak of the destructive [[Byzantine civil war of 1341\u201347]], which consumed the resources of the empire and left it in an untenable position. The weakened Byzantine Empire failed to prevent the formation of the Serbian Empire or, more ominously, the Ottoman invasion of Europe.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

During his reign, the Turks conquered most of the Western Anatolian territories of the Empire and, during the last years of his reign, he also had to fight his grandson [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos]] in the [[First Palaiologan Civil War]]. The civil war ended in Andronikos&nbsp;II's forced abdication in 1328 after which he retired to a monastery.\n\n==Life==\nAndronikos II was born Andronikos Doukas Angelos Komnenos Palaiologos ({{lang|gkm|\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f0c\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}}) at [[Nicaea]]. He was the eldest surviving son of [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and [[Theodora Palaiologina (Byzantine empress)|Theodora Palaiologina]], grandniece of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]].\n\nAndronikos was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261, after his father Michael VIII recovered [[Constantinople]] from the [[Latin Empire]], but he was not crowned until 1272. Sole emperor from 1282, Andronikos II immediately repudiated his father's unpopular Church union with the [[Papacy]], which he had been forced to support while his father was still alive, but he was unable to resolve the related schism within the Orthodox clergy until 1310.\n\nAndronikos II was also plagued by economic difficulties. During his reign the value of the Byzantine ''[[hyperpyron]]'' depreciated precipitously, while the state treasury accumulated less than one seventh the revenue (in nominal coins) that it had previously. Seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenses, Andronikos II raised taxes, reduced tax exemptions, and dismantled the Byzantine fleet (80 ships) in 1285, thereby making the Empire increasingly dependent on the rival republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 1291, he hired 50\u201360 Genoese ships, but the Byzantine weakness resulting from the lack of a navy became painfully apparent in the two wars with Venice in [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian War (1296\u20131302)|1296\u20131302]] and [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian War (1306\u201310)|1306\u201310]]. Later, in 1320, he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys, but failed.\n\nAndronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the [[Byzantine Empire]] through diplomacy. After the death of his first wife Anne of Hungary, he married [[Irene of Montferrat|Yolanda (renamed Irene) of Montferrat]], putting an end to the Montferrat claim to the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. Andronikos II also attempted to marry off his son and co-emperor [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] to the Latin Empress [[Catherine I of Courtenay]], thus seeking to eliminate Western agitation for a restoration of the Latin Empire. Another marriage alliance attempted to resolve the potential conflict with [[Serbia]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], as Andronikos II married off his five-year-old daughter [[Simonida|Simonis]] to King [[Stefan Milutin]] in 1298.\n\n[[Image:AndronikosIIandMichaelIXPalaeologusSilverBasilikon.jpg|thumb|left|Andronikos II and [[Michael IX Palaeologus]] (Silver basilikon)]]\n\nIn spite of the resolution of problems in [[Europe]], Andronikos II was faced with the collapse of the Byzantine frontier in [[Asia Minor]], despite the successful, but short, governorships of [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] and [[John Tarchaneiotes]]. The successful military victories in Asia Minor by [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] and [[John Tarchaneiotes]] against the Turks were largely dependent on a considerable military contingent of Cretan escapees, or exiles from Venetian-occupied Crete, headed by Hortatzis, whom [[Michael VIII]] had repatriated to Byzantium through a treaty agreement with the Venetians ratified in 1277.<ref>Agelarakis, P. A. (2012), Cretans in Byzantine foreign policy and military affairs following the Fourth Crusade. Cretika Chronika, 32, 41-78.</ref> Andronikos II had resettled those Cretans in the region of Meander river, the southeastern Asia Minor frontier of Byzantium with the Turks.\n\nAfter the failure of the co-emperor Michael IX to stem the Turkish advance in Asia Minor in 1302 and the disastrous [[Battle of Bapheus]], the Byzantine government hired the [[Catalan Company]] of [[Almogavars]] (adventurers from [[Catalonia]]) led by [[Roger de Flor]] to clear Byzantine Asia Minor of the enemy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In spite of some successes, the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains. Being more ruthless and savage than the enemy they intended to subdue they quarreled with Michael IX, and eventually openly turned on their Byzantine employers after the murder of Roger de Flor in 1305; together with a party of willing Turks they devastated [[Thrace]], Macedonia, and [[Thessaly]] on their road to Latin occupied southern Greece. There they conquered the [[Duchy of Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions, and [[Bursa, Turkey|Prusa]] fell in 1326.

The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage, between Michael IX's daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor. The dissolute behavior of Michael IX's son [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] led to a rift in the family, and after Michael IX's death in 1320, Andronikos II disowned his grandson, prompting a [[First Palaiologan Civil War|civil war]] that raged, with interruptions, until 1328. The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement, and [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]] attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support.

He was the son of [[Isaac Komnenos (d. 1152)|Isaac Komnenos]] and the grandson of the emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]].\n{{TOClimit|2}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nAndronikos Komnenos was born around 1118. He was handsome and eloquent, active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician, but also licentious.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} His early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service.\n\nIn 1141 he was taken captive by the [[Seljuq Turks]] and remained in their hands for a year. On being ransomed, he went to [[Constantinople]], where he was held at the court of his [[first cousin]], the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I Komnenos]], to whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, Eudoxia, attracted him and she became his mistress.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in [[Cilicia]]. [[Battle of Mamistra|Failing]] in his principal enterprise, an attack upon [[Mopsuestia]], he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province.  This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Exile===\nAbout 1153, a conspiracy against the Emperor in which Andronikos participated was discovered, and he was thrown in prison. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he escaped in 1165.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} After passing through many dangers, including captivity in [[Vlach]] territory,{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=131}} he reached [[Kiev]], where his cousin [[Yaroslav Osmomysl]] of [[Principality of Halych|Galicia]] held court. While under the protection of Yaroslav, Andronikos formed an alliance with the Emperor Manuel I, and with a Galician army he joined Manuel in the invasion of [[Hungary]], assisting at the siege of [[Zemun|Semlin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The campaign was successful, and Andronikos returned to Constantinople with Manuel I in 1168; a year later, however, Andronikos refused to take the oath of allegiance to the future king [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], whom Manuel desired to become his successor. Andronikos was removed from court but received the province of [[Cilicia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nStill under the displeasure of the Emperor, Andronikos fled to the court of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]]. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the Prince, [[Philippa of Antioch|Philippa]], sister of the Empress [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]]. The Emperor was again angered by this dishonour, and Andronikos was compelled to flee.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} He took refuge with King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the [[Principality of Galilee|Lordship of Beirut]]. In Jerusalem he saw [[Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Theodora Komnene]], the beautiful widow of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and niece of the Emperor Manuel. Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronikos to the court of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the [[Rulers of Damascus|Sultan of Damascus]]. Feeling unsafe there, they continued their perilous journey through the [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} They were well received by King [[George III of Georgia]], whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of Andronikos.\n\nAndronikos was granted estates in [[Kakhetia]], in the east of Georgia. In 1173 or 1174, he accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to [[Shirvan]] up to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shores, where George recaptured the fortress of Shabaran from the invaders from [[Derbent|Darband]] for his cousin, the [[Shirvanshah]] [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Akhsitan I]].{{sfn|Minorsky|1945|pp=557\u2013558}} Finally, Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at [[Oinaion]], on the shores of the [[Black Sea]], between [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]].<ref>Speros Vryonis Jr., ''The Decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century'', (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), p. 127</ref> While Andronikos was on one of his incursions into Trebizond, his castle was surprised by the governor of that province, and Theodora and her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, besought pardon. This he obtained, and he was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Emperor===\nIn 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son [[Alexius II Comnenus|Alexios II]], who was under the guardianship of his mother, Empress Maria.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Her Latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her Greek subjects. They had felt insulted by the Western tastes of Manuel, and being ruled by his Western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This gave Andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself, leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents.<ref>\n* [[Ibn Jubayr]] p. 355 Broadhurst (Turks and Arabs);{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[William of Tyre]], ''Historia Transmarina'' 22.11 (''innumeras Barbararum nationum secum trahens copias'');{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[Walter Map]], ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' 2.18 (Turks).{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n</ref> The defection of the commander of the Byzantine navy, ''[[megas doux]]'' [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]], and the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter Constantinople.{{sfn|Angold|1997|p=267}}\n\nThe arrival of Andronikos Komnenos was soon followed by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of the city's Latin inhabitants]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who virtually controlled its economy, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Westerners. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister [[Maria Komnene (Porphyrogenita)|Maria the Porphyrogenita]] and her husband [[Renier of Montferrat]], although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene; the poisoner was said to be the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Pterygeonites.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the poisoning and the details}} Soon afterwards Andronikos had the Empress Maria imprisoned and then killed \u2014 forcing a signature from the child Emperor Alexios to put his mother to death \u2014 by Pterygeonites and the ''[[hetaireiarches]]'' Constantine Tripsychos.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalk\u00e8]] and was then quickly put to death in turn; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos, and [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]].{{sfn|Choniates|1984|pp=260\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1183, sixty-five year old Andronikos married twelve-year-old [[Agnes of France, Empress consort of the Eastern Roman Empire|Agnes of France]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Ad\u00e8le of Champagne]] \u2014 Agnes had been betrothed to Alexios II.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the previous betrothal}} By November 1183, Andronikos had associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In 1184, a Venetian embassy visited Constantinople, and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1,500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe reign of Andronikos was characterized by his harsh measures. He resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check [[feudalism]] and limit the power of the nobles, who were rivals for his throne. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of Manuel I's rule.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent, however, and the Empire descended into a terror state.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. In September 1185, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, exiles, and their families for collusion with the invaders. The aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} and there were several revolts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe stories of chaos led to an invasion by King [[William II of Sicily|William]] of the Norman Sicilians.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} William landed in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] with a strong force of 200 ships and 80,000 men, including 5,000 knights,{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers}} and marched as far as [[Thessalonica]], which he [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|took and pillaged]] ruthlessly (7,000 Greeks died).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers and ethnicity}} Andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the Sicilian army from reaching Constantinople, but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills. Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor, [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for everything since the last Chisholm 1911 as none of these details are in EB1911 so they need a citation from another source}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Death of andronic I.png|thumb|250px|A medieval depiction of the death of Andronikos.

But on September 11, 1185, during his absence from the capital{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Stephen Hagiochristophorites, his lieutenant, moved to arrest [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]], whose loyalty was suspect.{{sfn|Harris|2003|p=136}} Angelos killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nWhen Andronikos arrived he found that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The deposed emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but they were captured (though some claim that Andronikos survived and managed to escape to the self-proclaimed kingdom of [[Cyprus]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Angelos handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face, punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} At last he was led to the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] and hung by his feet between two pillars.

He professes to have been \"a former soldier and a [[Greek people|Greek]]\" (''miles quondam et graecus''),<ref>Amm. 31.16.9</ref> and his enrollment among the elite ''protectores domestici'' (household guards) shows that he was of middle class or higher birth. Consensus is that Ammianus probably came from a curial family, but it is also possible that he was the son of a ''comes Orientis'' of the same family name. He entered the army at an early age, when [[Constantius II]] was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], governor of [[Nisibis]] in [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], and ''magister militum''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:Diyarbakirwalls2.jpg|thumb|The walls of Amida, built by [[Constantius II]] before the [[Siege of Amida]] of 359.

Silvanus had been forced by the allegedly false accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in [[Gaul]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Ammianus campaigned in the East twice under Ursicinus. On one occasion, he became separated from the officer's entourage and took refuge in [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]] during the [[Siege of Amida|siege of the city]] by the Sassanids under King [[Shapur II]]; he reportedly barely escaped with his life.<ref>The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan pp29-30</ref>\n\nWhen Ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by Constantius, Ammianus too seems to have retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in [[Julian (emperor)|Julian's]] Persian campaigns has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.\nHe accompanied Julian, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the [[Alamanni]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \nAfter Julian's death, Ammianus accompanied the retreat of the new emperor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]], as far as Antioch. \nHe was residing in Antioch in 372 when a certain [[Theodorus (usurper)|Theodorus]] was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor [[Valens]] by divination. \nSpeaking as an alleged eyewitness, Marcellinus recounts how Theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture, and cruelly punished.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:IVLIANVS.png|thumb|200 px|Portrait of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] on a bronze coin of [[Antioch]]]] \nHe eventually settled in Rome and began the ''Res Gestae''.

The ''Res Gestae'' (''Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI'') was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost (historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which if correct would mean that eighteen books have been lost{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fisher, H. A. L.|authorlink=H. A. L.

It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the ''Res Gestae'' into question.\n\nHis work has suffered substantially from manuscript transmission. Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books, the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]]. The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] text, Vatican lat. 1873 (''V''), produced in [[Fulda]] from an insular exemplar. The only independent textual source for Ammianus lies in Fragmenta Marbugensia (''M''), another ninth-century [[Franks|Frankish]] [[codex]] which was taken apart to provide covers for account-books during the fifteenth century. Only six leaves of ''M'' survive; however, before this manuscript was dismantled the Abbot of Hersfeld lent the manuscript to [[Sigismund Gelenius]], who used it in preparing the text of the second Froben edition (''G''). The dates and relationship of V and M were long disputed until 1936 when R. P. Robinson demonstrated persuasively that V was copied from M. As L.D. Reynolds summarizes, \"M is thus a fragment of the archetype; symptoms of an insular pre-archetype are evident.\"<ref name=Reynolds>L.D. Reynolds (ed.), ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), pp. 6ff</ref>\n\nHis handling from his earliest printers was little better. The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was printed in 1474 in Rome by Georg Sachsel and Bartholomaeus Golsch, which broke off at the end of Book 26. The next edition (Bologna, 1517) suffered from its editor's  conjectures upon the poor text of the 1474 edition; the 1474 edition was pirated for the first Froben edition (Basle, 1518). It was not until 1533 that the last five books of Ammianus' history were put into print by Silvanus Otmar and edited by Mariangelus Accursius. The first modern edition was produced by C.U. Clark (Berlin, 1910\u20131913).<ref name=Reynolds/> The first English translations were by [[Philemon Holland]] in 1609, and later by [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D. Yonge]] in 1862.<ref>J.C.

As a result, it is difficult for the reader to understand why the battles he describes had the outcome they did.<ref>The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, pp. 27\u201329.</ref>\n\nAmmianus' work contains a detailed description of the [[365 Crete earthquake|tsunami]] in Alexandria which devastated the metropolis and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean on 21 July 365.

The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert|John L. \"Jack\" Swigert]] as Command Module Pilot and [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise]] as Lunar Module Pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to [[Rubella|German measles]].\n\nThe story of the Apollo 13 mission has been dramatized multiple times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.\n\n==Crew==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut\n|position1        = Commander\n|crew1_up         = [[Jim Lovell]]\n|flights1_up      = Fourth and last\n|position2        = Command Module Pilot\n|crew2_up         = [[Jack Swigert]]\n|flights2_up      = Only\n|position3        = Lunar Module Pilot\n|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise]]\n|flights3_up      = Only\n}}\n\n===Prime and backup crew===\nAccording to the standard crew rotation in place during the Apollo program, the prime crew for Apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for [[Apollo 10]] with Mercury and Gemini veteran [[L.

Mitchell]] (Lunar Module Pilot).\n\n[[Deke Slayton]], NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, never intended to rotate Cooper and Eisele to another mission, as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7]] and an extra-marital [[affair]]). He assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made.<ref name=\"slayton\">{{Cite book |title=Deke!

[[Lyndon B.

Oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero. About three minutes later, the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed. Lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting \"a gas of some sort\" into space. The number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.<ref name=\"report\" />\n\nBecause the fuel cells generated the Command/Service Module's electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water, when oxygen tank 1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell finally shut down, leaving the craft on the Command Module's limited-duration battery power and water.

The existing abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module Propulsion System (SPS) engine to achieve a {{convert|6079|ft/s|m/s|adj=on}} [[delta-v|delta-''v'']].<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;III-14</sup> Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-''v'' was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first,<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;II-1</sup> and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was \"out of the question.\"<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;III-17</sup> An alternative would have been to burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the Service Module and make a second burn with the LM [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the Service Module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the Command Module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of gravitational influence]] (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn.<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p. B-5</sup> There also was concern about \"the structural integrity of the Service Module,\"<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;III\u201123</sup> so mission planners were instructed that the SPS engine would not be used \"except as a last-ditch effort.\"<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;III-14</sup>\n\nFor these reasons, Kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option, using the Moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial [[free-return trajectory]] earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon (\"PC+2 burn\"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort,<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;III-20</sup> but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.\n\n[[File:Apollo13 apparatus.jpg|thumb|Astronaut John L.

Low power levels made even voice communications difficult.\n\nThe Lunar Module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half, not three people for four days. Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. Unlike the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM), which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by [[Silver-oxide battery|silver-zinc batteries]], so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until re-entry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible. In particular, the LM's [[Abort Guidance System]] was used for most of the coast back to Earth instead of the primary guidance system, as it used less power and water.<ref name = \"missionopreport\"/><sup>pp.&nbsp;III\u201117,33,40</sup>\n\nAvailability of [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH) for [[carbon dioxide scrubber|removing carbon dioxide]] presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose. NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as \"the mailbox\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo13/html/as13-62-8929.html |title=AS13-62-8929 |work=Apollo Imagery |publisher=NASA |date=April 11\u201317, 1970 |id=NASA photo ID: [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS13/10075507.htm AS13-62-8929]; GRIN DataBase Number: GPN-2002-000056 |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Barell |first1=John| title=Antarctic Adventures: Life Lessons from Polar Explorers |date=November 18, 2016 |publisher=Balboa Press |isbn=9781504366526 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJiaDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT154 |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight.

The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's [[reaction control system]] (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist [[Bernard Etkin]], was formed to solve the problem within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using [[slide rule]]s. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.<ref name=\"G&M\">{{cite news|title=Bernard Etkin helped avert Apollo 13 tragedy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/bernard-etkin-helped-avert-apollo-13-tragedy/article19735265/#dashboard/follows/|accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=''The Globe and Mail''}}</ref>\n\n===Re-entry and splashdown===\n[[File:Apollo13 splashdown.jpg|thumb|Apollo 13 splashes down in the South Pacific on April 17, 1970]]\nAs Apollo 13 neared Earth, the crew first jettisoned the Service Module, using the LM's [[reaction control system]] to pull themselves a safe distance from it, instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the SM's RCS. They photographed it for later analysis of the accident's cause. It was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire Sector 4 panel had been blown off. According to the analysts, these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment.\n\nFinally, the crew jettisoned the Lunar Module ''Aquarius'' using the above procedure worked out at the University of Toronto, leaving the Command Module ''Odyssey'' to begin its lone re-entry through the atmosphere. The re-entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the Command Module. The blackout in Apollo 13's reentry lasted six minutes, which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected.<ref>{{cite news |title=Did Ron Howard exaggerate the reentry scene in the movie Apollo 13? |first=Joe |last=Pappalardo |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/need-to-know/did-ron-howard-exaggerate-the-reentry-scene-in-the-movie-apollo-13-17639496/ |work=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> The possibility of heat-shield damage from the {{chem|O|2}} tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period.\n\n''Odyssey'' regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean, {{Coord|21|38|24|S|165|21|42|W|type:event|name=Apollo 13 splashdown}}, southeast of [[American Samoa]] and {{convert|6.5|km|nmi|abbr=on}} from the recovery ship, [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']].\nThe crew was in good condition except for Haise, who was suffering from a serious [[urinary tract infection]] because of insufficient water intake.

The shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.<ref name=\"report\" />\n\nThe board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events. Tanks storing [[cryogen]]s, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, extremely good insulation, or both, in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks' contents. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water. The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible.\n\nThe tank contained several components relevant to the accident:\n* a quantity sensor;\n* a fan to stir the tank contents for more accurate quantity measurements;\n* a [[heater]] to vaporize liquid oxygen as needed;\n* a [[thermostat]] to protect the heater;\n* a [[temperature sensor]];\n* fill and drain valves and piping.\n\nThe heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the Command Module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. [[Beechcraft]], the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage.\n\nThe oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the Apollo 10 Service Module, but was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped about {{convert|2|in|cm|0}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The tank appeared to be undamaged, but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged, and photographs suggested that the close-out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf. The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be \"rather low.\"<ref name=\"report\" />\nAfter the tank was filled for ground testing, it could not be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of {{convert|27|C|F}}. When the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered. The board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage.\nThis raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated {{convert|540|C|F|-1}}. A [[chart recorder]] on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the {{convert|27|C|F}} thermostat opening temperature, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html |last=Williams |first=David R. |title=The Apollo 13 Accident |work=National Space Science Data Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"lostMoon\">{{cite book |last1= Lovell |first1=Jim |last2=Kluger |first2=Jeffrey |title=[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]] |year=1994 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-67029-2 |lccn=94028052 |pages=349\u201350}}</ref> The gas boiled off in hours rather than days.\n\nThe sustained high temperatures melted the [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed. When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off. During the \"cryo stir\" procedure, fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted, producing sparks and igniting the Teflon. This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it.\n\n[[File:Apollo13 tank2.jpg|thumb|Apollo 13 details of oxygen tank number 2 and the heater and thermostat unit]]\nIn June 1970, the Cortright Report<ref name=\"report\" /> provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices. It included a copy of established NASA procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank, to include:\n*Turning the four tank heaters and fans off;\n*Pulling the two heater circuit breakers to open to remove the energy source;\n*Performing a 2-minute purge, or directly opening the O<sub>2</sub> valve.\n[[File:TankRuptureParametersGraph - Apollo13 CortrightReport pg B-47 (pg A-209 inlay).png|thumb|Telemetered parameters of the oxygen tank rupture incident, with inset image of pressure relief valve]]\nThis procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued.

Prior to the accident, the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours. This was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium (SHe) tank in the LM descent stage, which had been suspect since before launch. After the abort decision, the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture. The helium tank [[burst disc]] ruptured at 108:54, after the lunar flyby.

It was the first mission in the United States' [[Apollo program]] to carry a crew into space. It was also the first U.S. spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]] in November 1966. The [[Apollo 1|AS-204 mission]], also known as \"Apollo 1\", was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program. It was scheduled to launch in February 1967, but a [[Apollo 1#Accident|fire]] in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. Manned flights were then suspended for 21 months, while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures, and unmanned test flights of the [[Saturn V]] rocket and [[Apollo Lunar Module]] were made. Apollo 7 fulfilled Apollo 1's mission of testing the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) in [[low Earth orbit]].\n\nThe Apollo 7 crew was commanded by [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]], with senior pilot / navigator [[Donn F. Eisele]], and pilot / systems engineer [[Walter Cunningham|R. Walter Cunningham]]. Official crew titles were made consistent with those that would be used for the manned lunar landing missions: Eisele was ''Command Module Pilot'' and Cunningham was ''Lunar Module Pilot''. Their mission was [[List of Apollo mission types|Apollo's 'C' mission]], an 11-day Earth-orbital test flight to check out the redesigned Block II CSM with a crew on board. It was the first time a [[Saturn IB]] vehicle put a crew into space; Apollo 7 was the first three-person American space mission, and the first to include a live TV broadcast from an American spacecraft. It was launched on October 11, 1968, from what was then known as [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]], Florida. Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a complete technical success, giving [[NASA]] the confidence to send [[Apollo 8]] into orbit around the [[Moon]] two months later. The flight would prove to be the final space flight for all of its three crew members\u2014and the only one for both Cunningham and Eisele\u2014when it splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on October 22, 1968. It was also the only [[Human spaceflight|manned launch]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]], as well as the last launch from the complex.\n\n==Crew==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut<ref name=\"crew\">{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/orbital-missions/apollo7-crew.cfm|title=Apollo 7 Crew - National Air and Space Museum|website=airandspace.si.edu|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n|position1        = Commander\n|crew1_up         = [[Wally Schirra|Walter M.

They were to fly a second Earth orbital test of the original Block I Command/Service module (not designed to dock with the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] for lunar flight) after [[Apollo 1]], the first manned flight, to be made by [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]]. In December 1966, the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled, and Schirra's crew were reassigned as Grissom's backup.\n\nPlans for the first manned Apollo flights were completely disrupted by the January 27, 1967 cabin fire which killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee. Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first manned flight, which would now use the Block II spacecraft designed for the lunar missions. The [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) and astronauts' spacesuits had been extensively redesigned, to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew. Schirra thus became the only astronaut to fly [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and Apollo missions.<ref name=\"Schirra's Obituary\">{{cite news |last=Watkins |first=Thomas |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Astronaut Walter Schirra dies at 84 |url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/latest_news/article_b5ab61b9-cbe9-5db5-b76f-8cfd89096919.html |newspaper=[[Valley Morning Star]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=Harlingen, Texas |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> His crew would test the life support, propulsion, guidance and control systems during this \"open-ended\" mission (meaning it would be extended as it passed each test).

The astronauts described it as very smooth riding compared to the rough, bumpy Titan II used to launch the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spacecraft.\n\nFollowing orbital injection and separation from the [[S-IVB]], the crew turned the CSM around using its [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control System]] thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated Lunar Module rendezvous and docking, using a visual reference target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOM]] [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]] of his \"angry alligator\" experience on [[Gemini 9A]], when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |title=Apollo 7 |last=Wade |first=Mark |website=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |accessdate=October 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012111046/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight firings, performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and [[specific impulse]] values. As the Saturn IB itself had performed very smoothly during launch, the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the SPS, leading to Schirra yelling \"Yabbadabbadoo!\" in reference to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon. Don Eisele called it \"a real boot in the rear.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf |title= Apollo 7 Mission Report |date= December 1, 1968 | publisher=NASA |pages=5\u2013158 |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nAn assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight; these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days, a momentary undervoltage of the main AC buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module LOX and LH2 tanks, and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following SM jettison at the end of the mission, meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost. Aside from the last event, which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator, all of the problems on Apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions.\n\nApollo promised the best food preparation yet seen on a manned spacecraft. For the first time, astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with (the food came in freeze-dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water) and Wally Schirra, who had  had only toothpaste-like tubes for food on his [[Mercury-Atlas 8|Mercury flight]], described the food as \"Still does not match home cooking, but it comes a lot closer than space food used to.\" Thirty-three meals were provided for the three crewmen, allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space. Even so, the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet, although the menus had been prepared based on their personal preferences.\n\nEarly fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was \"incredibly easy\" with no gravity to work against. As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful, a stretching device called the Exer-Genie was provided for relaxing aching muscles.<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nAnother mission goal was the first [[Apollo TV camera|live television]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had transmitted [[Slow-scan television|slow scan television]] pictures from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|''Faith 7'']] in 1963, which were never broadcast).<ref name=\"Apollo video camera\">[[#Steven-Boniecki 2010|Steven-Boniecki 2010]], pp. 55\u201358</ref> It was initially scheduled for midday on day two, but Schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] test.<ref name=\"Schirra Cancels TV\">{{cite news |title=Schirra rules no telecast |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjQ_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=cVEMAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%207%20television%20broadcast&pg=1799%2C3226547 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |newspaper=[[Windsor Star|The Windsor Star]] |date=October 12, 1968 |agency=United Press International |location=Windsor, Ontario |page=1 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"Mutiny\" in space===\nEven though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less-than-ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew [[motion sickness]], which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe [[Common cold|head cold]]. As a result, he became irritable with requests from [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)|Mission Control]] and all three astronauts began \"talking back\" to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:\n[[Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Schirra]] looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission]]\n<blockquote>\nSCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.<br />\nCAPCOM ([[Jack Swigert]]): Roger. Copy.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.<br />\nSCHIRRA: Roger.<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7<br />\nCAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.<br />\nSCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |pages=117\u2013118 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to [[Valsalva maneuver|pinch their noses and blow]] to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous \"fishbowl\" type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:\n<blockquote>\nCAPCOM Number 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand that there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. <br />\nSCHIRRA: And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one. <br />\nCAPCOM: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. <br />\nCAPCOM: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. <br />\nCAPCOM: Yes. <br />\nSCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. <br />\nCAPCOM: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less\nabout the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. <br />\nSCHIRRA: Thank you, babe. <br />\nCAPCOM: Over and out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |page=1170 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nExchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions (Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA).<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" /> Some scientists{{who|date=October 2018}} have observed that the psychology unique to the high-pressure spaceflight environment that led to such workplace tension was poorly grasped at the time, but it became better understood during the [[Skylab]] program and especially by the much-later [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]].\n\n===Reentry and post-flight evaluation===\n\nThe [[splashdown]] point was {{coord|27|32|N|64|04|W}}, {{convert|200|nmi|km}} SSW of [[Bermuda]] and {{convert|7|nmi|km|abbr=on}} north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']].<ref name=\"astronautix.com\" />\n\nDespite the difficulties between the crew and Mission Control, the mission successfully met its objectives to verify the Apollo Command and Service Modules' flight worthiness, allowing Apollo 8's flight to the Moon to proceed just two months later.<ref name=\"Apollo Crew Honored 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102008a.html |title=First Apollo flight crew last to be honored |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=October 20, 2008 |website=collectSPACE |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Apollo 7 was Project Apollo's only human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].<ref>The Air Force Station was originally named Cape Canaveral, but the name was changed to Cape Kennedy by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

The mission was the second crewed launch of a [[Saturn V]] [[rocket]].\n\nAfter launching on March 3, 1969, the crew performed the first crewed flight of a LM, the first docking and extraction of a LM, two [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]] (EVA), and the second docking of two crewed [[spacecraft]]\u2014two months after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] performed a spacewalk crew transfer between [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]]. The mission proved the LM worthy of crewed spaceflight. Further tests on the [[Apollo 10]] mission would prepare the LM for its ultimate goal, landing on the Moon.

By December 1966, the original AS-205 mission was cancelled, Schirra's crew was named as Grissom's backup, and McDivitt's crew was promoted to prime crew for the LM test mission,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

NASA was able to use the 18-month hiatus to catch up with development and un-crewed testing of the LM and the Saturn V launch vehicle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

This would be followed by a higher Earth orbit flight ('''E Mission'''), to be crewed by [[Frank Borman]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[William Anders]] in early 1969.\n\nHowever, LM problems again prevented it from being ready for the D mission by December, so NASA officials created another mission for [[Apollo 8]] using the Saturn V to launch only the CSM on the first crewed flight to orbit the Moon, and the E mission was cancelled as unnecessary. Slayton asked McDivitt and Borman which mission they preferred to fly; McDivitt wanted to fly the LM, while Borman volunteered for the pioneering lunar flight. Therefore, Slayton swapped the crews, and McDivitt's crew flew Apollo 9.\n\nThe crew swap also affected who would be the first crew to land on the Moon; when the crews for Apollo 8 and 9 were swapped, their backup crews were also swapped. Since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later, this put [[Neil Armstrong]]'s crew (Borman's backup) in position for the first landing mission [[Apollo 11]] instead of [[Pete Conrad]]'s crew, who made the second landing on [[Apollo 12]].\n\n==Mission highlights==\n[[File:Apollo-9-Lancering.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 9 launches from [[Kennedy Space Center]], March 3, 1969]]\n\nApollo 9 was the first space test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the third critical piece of Apollo hardware besides the Command/Service Module and the Saturn V launch vehicle\u2014the Lunar Module. It was also the first [[space rendezvous|space docking]] of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them. For ten days, the astronauts put both Apollo spacecraft through their paces in Earth orbit, including an undocking and redocking of the LM with the CSM, just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task, on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend.\n\nFor this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft (the last spacecraft to have been named was [[Gemini 3]]). The gangly LM was named ''Spider'', and the CSM was labeled ''Gumdrop'' because of the Command Module's shape, and because of the blue wrapping in which the craft arrived at [[Kennedy Space Center]]. These names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently.\n\nSchweickart and Scott performed an EVA\u2014Schweickart checked out the new [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Apollo spacesuit]], the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft, while Scott filmed him from the Command Module hatch. Schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit, and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an EVA from the Lunar Module to the Command Module in an emergency, but as he had been suffering from [[Space adaptation syndrome|space sickness]] the extra tests were scratched.\n\n[[File:Apollo 9 approaches splashdown.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 9 approaches [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], March 13, 1969]]\n\nMcDivitt and Schweickart later test-flew the LM, and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in Earth orbit. They flew the LM up to {{convert|111|mi|km}} from ''Gumdrop'', using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally, before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return. This test flight represented the first flight of a crewed spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe splashdown point was 23\u00b015\u2032N, 67\u00b056\u2032W, {{convert|290|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}}<!--Must do it this way; for some reason, 160 nmi converts to 300 km, which is incorrect--> east of [[the Bahamas]] and within sight of the recovery ship [[USS Guadalcanal (LPH-7)|USS ''Guadalcanal'']]. Apollo 9 was the last spacecraft to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Command Module was displayed at the Michigan Space and Science Center, [[Jackson, Michigan]], until April 2004 when the center closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/3548|title=Jackson, MI - Michigan Space Center (Closed)|website=www.roadsideamerica.com}}</ref> In May 2004, it was moved to the [[San Diego Air & Space Museum|San Diego Aerospace Museum]] (now named the San Diego Air & Space Museum). The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on October 23, 1981, the LM descent stage (1969-018D) orbit decayed March 22, 1969. The [[S-IVB]] stage [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine was restarted after Lunar Module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion.\n\nThe [[S-IVB|Saturn IVB]] [[third stage]] became a [[:Category:Derelict satellites in heliocentric orbit|derelict]] [[space debris|object]] where it would continue to [[heliocentric orbit|orbit the Sun]] for many years.  {{asof|2014|11}}, it remains in orbit.<ref name=ha20130923>{{cite web |title=Saturn S-IVB-504N - Satellite Information |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SatInfo.aspx?satid=3770&lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT |work=Satellite database |publisher=Heavens-Above |accessdate=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Mission insignia==\n[[File:Apollo 9 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-260).jpg|thumb|Apollo 9 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]\nThe circular patch shows a drawing of a Saturn V rocket with the letters USA on it.

In recent years{{when|date=November 2017}}, some joint or limb deformities, such as knock-knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia, have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65.

The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and [[cartilage]] which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. RA often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows, is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body), and can lead to severe [[deformity]] in a few years if not treated. RA occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin [[rash]], [[fever]], [[pain]], disability, and limitations in daily activities. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. The drugs to treat RA range from [[corticosteroid]]s to [[monoclonal antibodies]] given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. Treatments also include analgesics such as [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s and [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs), while in rare cases, surgery may be required to replace joints, but there is no cure for the disease.<ref>[http://www.aihw.gov.au/rheumatoid-arthritis/management/ Medications used to manage rheumatoid arthritis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030828/http://www.aihw.gov.au/rheumatoid-arthritis/management/ |date=2015-11-17 }}, Australian Institute Of Health And Welfare.

Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities. Assistive technology is a tool used to aid a person's disability by reducing their physical barriers by improving the use of their damaged body part, typically after an amputation. Assistive technology devices can be customized to the patient or bought commercially. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aota.org/About-Occupational-Therapy/Professionals/RDP/assistive-technology.aspx|title=The Role of Occupational Therapy in Providing Assistive Technology Devices and Services|last=|first=|date=2018|website=www.aota.org|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Medications===\nThere are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis.

From India, the system was adopted by [[Arabic mathematics|Arabic mathematicians]] in [[Baghdad]] and passed on to the Arabs farther west. The current form of the numerals developed in North Africa.

The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade, books and [[colonialism]].\n\nThe term ''Arabic numerals'' is ambiguous, it may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]]. Although the phrase \"Arabic numeral\" is frequently capitalized, it is sometimes written in lower case: for instance in its entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'',<ref>\"Arabic\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition</ref> which helps to distinguish it from \"Arabic numerals\" as the Eastern Arabic numerals.\n\nAlternative names are '''Western Arabic numerals''', '''Western numerals''', '''Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals''', '''Hindu numerals''',<ref name=\"UniOfNthC1\"/> and [[Unicode]] calls them '''digits'''.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf Official Unicode Consortium code chart]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n{{Main|History of the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system}}\n[[File:Gwalior zeros.jpg|thumb|The numeral \"zero\" as it appears in two numbers (50 and 270) in an inscription in [[Gwalior]].

The system was revolutionary by including zero in [[positional notation]], thereby limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics. One may distinguish between this positional ''system'', which is identical throughout the family, and the precise [[glyph]]s used to write the numerals, which varied regionally.\n\nThe glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the [[Latin script]] since [[Early modern period|early modern times]] are <big>[[0 (number)|0]] [[1 (number)|1]] [[2 (number)|2]] [[3 (number)|3]] [[4 (number)|4]] [[5 (number)|5]] [[6 (number)|6]] [[7 (number)|7]] [[8 (number)|8]] [[9 (number)|9]]</big>.\nThe first universally accepted inscription containing the use of the 0 glyph in India is first recorded in the 9th century, in an inscription at [[Gwalior]] in [[Central India]] dated to 870. Numerous Indian documents on [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] exist, with the same symbol for zero in them, dated back as far as the 6th century AD, but their dates are uncertain.

The [[decimal point]] notation was introduced by [[Sind ibn Ali]], who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.\n\nA distinctive West Arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]] (sometimes called ''ghubar'' numerals, though the term is not always accepted), which are the direct ancestor of the modern \"Arabic numerals\" used throughout the world.<ref>\n{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|pp=12\u201313}}: \"While specimens of Western Arabic numerals from the early period\u2014the tenth to thirteenth centuries\u2014are still not available, we know at least that Hindu reckoning (called ''\u1e25is\u0101b al-ghub\u0101r'') was known in the West from the tenth century onward...\"\n</ref>\nWoepecke has proposed that the Western Arabic numerals were already in use in Spain before the arrival of the Moors, purportedly received via Alexandria, but this theory is not accepted by scholars.<ref>\n{{harvnb|Kunitzsch, The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered|2003|pp=12\u201313}}: \"Since edition of and research on the Pseudo-Boethius[41] we now know that the texts running under his name and carrying Arabic numerals date from the eleventh century.

Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth. He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.\n\n[[Leonardo Fibonacci]] ([[Leonardo of Pisa]]), a mathematician born in the [[Republic of Pisa]] who had studied in [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] (Bougie), [[Algeria]], promoted the Indian numeral system in Europe with his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'':\n\n<blockquote>When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa|Bugia]] acting for the [[Pisa]]n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.</blockquote>\n\nThe numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, from the point of view of the reader, numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.\n\nThe reason the digits are more commonly known as \"Arabic numerals\" in Europe and the Americas is that they were introduced to Europe in the 10th century by Arabic-speakers of North Africa, who were then using the digits from Libya to Morocco. Arabs, on the other hand, call the system \"[[Hindu]] numerals\",<ref name=\"UniOfNthC1\">{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and \"Arabic\" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=4 July 2004|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"TWPTakeANo\">{{Citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-909875.html|title=Article: Take a Number, Please.|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Achenbach|date=16 September 1994|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref> referring to their origin in India.

(See G.F. Hill, ''The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe'' for more examples.) In central Europe, the [[King of Hungary]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456.<ref>Erd\u00e9lyi: Magyar m\u0171vel\u0151d\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9net 1-2. k\u00f6tet.

Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, potentially including both symbols that evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]], and symbols that developed independently. The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]]:\n\n* The widespread Western Arabic numerals used with the [[Latin script]], in the table below labelled ''European'', descended from the West Arabic numerals developed in [[al-Andalus]] ([[Andaluc\u00eda]], [[Spain]]) and the [[Maghreb]]. Spanish scholars, because of the geographic proximity, trade, and constant warfare with the Muslim kingdoms of Southern Spain, saw a potential in the simplicity of Arabic numbers, and decided to adopt those symbols, and later other Europeans followed suit. There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as [[text figures|lining figures and text figures]].\n* The Arabic\u2013Indic or [[Eastern Arabic numerals]], used with the [[Arabic script]], developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown below as East Arabic-Indic.\n* The [[Devanagari numerals]] used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants are grouped as [[Indian numerals]].\n\nThe evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown here in a table created by the French scholar [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla]] in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:\n\n[[File:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|frameless|upright=2.25|Table of numerals]]\n[[File:Apices du moyen-\u00e2ge.PNG|frameless|upright=2.25]]\n\n===Encoding===\n\nThe Arabic numerals 0\u20139 are encoded in [[ASCII]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39. Masking to the lower 4 binary bits (or taking the last [[hexadecimal]] digit) gives the value of the digit, a great help in converting text to numbers on early computers. These positions were inherited in [[Unicode]]<ref>https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf</ref> and in virtually all other encodings based in any way on ASCII. [[EBCDIC]] used different values, but also had the lower 4 bits equal to the digit value.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5.5em\"|Binary\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Octal\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Decimal\n!style=\"width: 2.5em\"|Hex\n!Glyph\n!Unicode\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0000\n|060\n|48\n|30\n|0||U+0030 DIGIT ZERO\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0001\n|061\n|49\n|31\n|1||U+0031 DIGIT ONE\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0010\n|062\n|50\n|32\n|2||U+0032 DIGIT TWO\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0011\n|063\n|51\n|33\n|3||U+0033 DIGIT THREE\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0100\n|064\n|52\n|34\n|4||U+0034 DIGIT FOUR\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0101\n|065\n|53\n|35\n|5||U+0035 DIGIT FIVE\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0110\n|066\n|54\n|36\n|6||U+0036 DIGIT SIX\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;0111\n|067\n|55\n|37\n|7||U+0037 DIGIT SEVEN\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;1000\n|070\n|56\n|38\n|8||U+0038 DIGIT EIGHT\n|-\n|0011&nbsp;1001\n|071\n|57\n|39\n|9||U+0039 DIGIT NINE\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abjad numerals]]\n* [[Chinese numerals]]\n* [[Counting rods]] \u2013 decimal positional numeral system with zero\n* [[Decimal]]\n* [[Greek numerals]]\n* [[Japanese numerals]]\n* [[Maya numerals]]\n* [[Regional handwriting variation#Arabic numerals|Regional variations in modern handwritten Arabic numerals]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citation |first=Paul |last= Kunitzsch |chapter=The Transmission of Hindu-Arabic Numerals Reconsidered |editor1=J.

The best known of them were the Roman author Apuleius, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and St. Augustine''\", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', Scholastic Library Publishing, 2005, v.3, p. 569</ref> and was from [[Madauros]] (now [[M'Daourouch]], [[Algeria]]). He studied Platonism in [[Athens]], travelled to [[Roman Italy|Italy]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], and was an initiate in several cults or [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the [[proconsul]] and a court of magistrates convened in [[Sabratha]], near ancient [[Tripoli]], Libya. This is known as the ''Apologia''.\n\nHis most famous work is his [[ribaldry|bawdy]] [[picaresque novel]], the ''Metamorphoses'', otherwise known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a [[donkey]].\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Apuleius, Opera omnia, 1621 - BEIC 9468424.tiff|thumb|''Apuleii Opera omnia'' (1621)]]\nApuleius was born in Madauros, a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' in [[Numidia]] on the [[North Africa]]n coast bordering [[Gaetuli]]a, and he described himself as \"half-Numidian half-Gaetulian.\"<ref name=\"Apuleius, Apology, 24\">Apuleius, ''Apology'', 24</ref> Madaurus was the same ''colonia'' where [[Augustine of Hippo]] later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no ''[[praenomen]]'' is given in any ancient source;<ref>P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', page xi. Oxford University Press.</ref> late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him ''Lucius'' from the name of the hero of his novel.<ref>Julia Haig Gaisser, (2008), ''The fortunes of Apuleius and the Golden Ass: a study in transmission and Reception'', page 69. Princeton University Press.</ref> Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (''Apology'') and his work ''[[Florida (Apuleius)|Florida]]'', which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.\n\nHis father was a provincial magistrate (''[[Duumviri|duumvir]]'')<ref name=\"Apuleius, Apology, 24\" /> who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million [[sestertius|sesterces]] to his two sons.<ref>Apuleius, ''Apology'', 23</ref> Apuleius studied with a master at [[Carthage]] (where he later settled) and later at [[Athens]], where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to [[Rome]]<ref>Apuleius, ''Florida'', 17.4</ref> to study Latin [[rhetoric]] and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.\n\nApuleius was an initiate in several [[Greco-Roman mysteries]], including the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].<ref>As he proudly claims in his ''Apologia''. (Winter, Thomas Nelson (2006) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=classicsfacpub ''Apology as Prosecution: The Trial of Apuleius''])</ref> He was a priest of [[Asclepius]]<ref>Apuleius, ''Florida'' 16.38 and 18.38</ref> and, according to Augustine,<ref>Augustine, ''Epistle'' 138.19.</ref> ''sacerdos provinciae Africae'' (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).\n\nNot long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to [[Alexandria]].<ref name=\"Apuleius, Apology, 72\">Apuleius, ''Apology'', 72.</ref> On his way there he was taken ill at the town of [[Oea]] (modern-day [[Tripoli]]) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens.<ref name=\"Apuleius, Apology, 72\" /> The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent&nbsp;\u2013 indeed encouragement&nbsp;\u2013 Apuleius agreed to marry her.<ref>Apuleius, ''Apology'', 73</ref> Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells.<ref>Apuleius, ''Apology'', 53, 66, 70, etc</ref> The case was heard at [[Sabratha]], near Tripoli, c.&nbsp;158&nbsp;AD, before [[Claudius Maximus]], [[proconsul]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].<ref>Apuleius, ''Apology'', 1, 59, 65</ref> The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''.<ref name=\"GTUApo\" />\n\nApuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.<ref>Apuleius, ''Apology'', 75\u201376; Rebecca Flemming (1999), \"''Quae corpore quaestum facit'': The Sexual Economy of Female Prostitution in the Roman Empire,\" ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89, p.&nbsp;41.</ref>\n\nOf his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature.

It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this [[frame story]] are found many [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]].\n\nThe ''Metamorphoses'' ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the [[mysteries of Isis|mystery cult of Isis]]; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]''. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the ''pastophoroi''&nbsp;\u2013 a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.<ref>Iles Johnson, Sarah, ''Mysteries'', in ''Ancient Religions'' pp. 104\u20135, The Belknap Press of Harvard University (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-674-02548-6}}</ref> The adventures of the ass stand at the beginning of the [[picaresque novel]] tradition which eventually produced ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]''.<ref>The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition.

Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections:\n* in the first, the writer refutes the accusations leveled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents.\n* The second tends to prove that his so-called \"magical operations\" were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist.\n* The third recounts the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him.\nThe main interest of the Apology is historical: it offers a lot of information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century. But, it is not devoid of literary value.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1989|title=Apul\u00e9e|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e9die berb\u00e8re]]|publisher=Edisud|url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2565|last=C\u00e8be|first=Jean-Pierre|date=|publication-place=Aix-en-Provence|volume=6 {{!}} Antilopes \u2013 Arzuges|pages=820-827}}</ref>\n\n=== Other works ===\nHis other works are:\n\n* ''Florida''.

He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard {{HMS|Weymouth|1693|6}} off West Africa.\n\nSelkirk was an unruly youth, and joined [[buccaneer]]ing voyages to the South Pacific during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. One such expedition was on ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', captained by Thomas Stradling and under the overall command of [[William Dampier]]. Stradling's ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.\n\nWhen he was eventually rescued by English privateer [[Woodes Rogers]], in company with Dampier, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicised after their return to England, becoming a source of inspiration for writer [[Daniel Defoe]]'s fictional character [[Robinson Crusoe]].\n\n==Early life and privateering==\nAlexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in [[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], Scotland, born in 1676.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=18\u201319}} In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. He was summoned before the [[Kirk Session]] in August 1693{{sfnp|Takahashi|Caldwell|C\u00e1ceres|Calder\u00f3n|2007|loc=n.&nbsp;11|ps=, \"Date of 1693, verified from the original Kirk Session Records (CH2/960/2, pp.&nbsp;29, 30), is erroneously given in other printed sources as 1695.\"}} for his \"indecent conduct in church\", but he \"did not appear, being gone to sea\". He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for assaulting his brothers.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nEarly on, he was engaged in [[buccaneer]]ing. In 1703 he joined an expedition of English [[privateer]] and explorer William Dampier to the [[South Pacific Ocean]],{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=1\u20132}} setting sail from [[Kinsale]] in Ireland on 11 September.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=3}} They carried [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] from the [[Prince George of Denmark|Lord High Admiral]] authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was then going on between England and Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/journeys/voyage_html/transcripts/stgeorge.htm|title=Letters of Marque and Reprisal for the St George, Declaration of William Dampier|website=The National Archives|date=13 October 1702|access-date=13 March 2016}}</ref> Dampier was [[captain (nautical)|captain]] of ''St George'' and Selkirk served on ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', ''St George''{{'}}s companion ship, as [[sailing master]] under Captain Thomas Stradling.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=33, 37\u201338}} By this time, Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea.{{sfnp|Howell|1829|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nIn February 1704, following a stormy passage around [[Cape Horn]],{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=14\u201315}} the privateers fought a long battle with a well-armed French vessel, ''St Joseph'', only to have it escape to warn its Spanish allies of their arrival in the Pacific.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=26}} A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of [[Santa Mar\u00eda, Herrera|Santa Mar\u00eda]] failed when their landing party was [[ambush]]ed.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=44\u201345}} The easy capture of ''Asunci\u00f3n'', a heavily laden merchantman, revived the men's hopes of plunder, and Selkirk was put in charge of the [[prize ship]]. Dampier took off some much-needed provisions of wine, brandy, sugar and flour; then abruptly set the ship free, arguing that the gain was not worth the effort. In May 1704 Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=45\u201347}}\n\n==Castaway==\n[[File:Rob-cru.png|thumb|left|alt=Shaded relief map of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands with blue ocean he died on the island background|Map of the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], where Selkirk lived as a castaway]]\nIn September 1704, after parting ways with Dampier,{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|pp=46\u201347}} Captain Stradling brought ''Cinque Ports'' to an island known to the Spanish as [[M\u00e1s a Tierra]] located in the uninhabited [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez archipelago]] {{convert|670|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies.{{sfnp|Lee|1987|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nSelkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel, and wanted to make the necessary repairs before going any farther. He declared that he would rather stay on Juan Fern\u00e1ndez than continue in a dangerously leaky ship.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}} Stradling took him up on the offer and landed Selkirk on the island with a [[musket]], a [[hatchet]], a knife, a cooking pot, a [[King James Bible|Bible]], bedding and some clothes.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=126}} Selkirk immediately regretted his rashness, but Stradling refused to let him back on board.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}}\n\n''Cinque Ports'' did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now Colombia. Stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish. The survivors were taken to [[Lima, Peru]], where they endured a harsh imprisonment.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=145, 333}}\n\n===Life on the island===\nAt first, Selkirk remained along the shoreline of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. During this time he ate [[spiny lobster]]s and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous [[Mirounga leonina|sea lions]], gathered on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island's interior.{{sfnp|Steele|1713|p=169\u2013171}} Once inland, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were available there: [[feral goat]]s\u2014introduced by earlier sailors\u2014provided him with meat and milk, while wild [[turnip]]s, [[Dendroseris litoralis|cabbage leaves]] and dried [[pink peppercorn|pepper berries]] offered him variety and spice. [[Rat]]s would attack him at night, but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near [[feral cat]]s.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\n[[File:Selkirk reading his Bible.png|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of Selkirk sitting in the doorway of a hut reading a Bible|Selkirk reading his Bible in one of two huts he built on a mountainside]]\nSelkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island: he forged a new knife out of [[barrel]] hoops left on the beach,{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=128}} he built two huts out of [[Schinus molle|pepper]] trees, one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping, and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nChildhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he had no need to replace them, since his toughened, calloused feet made protection unnecessary.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=128}} He sang [[Psalms#The Psalms in Christian worship|psalms]] and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=126}}\n\nDuring his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor. Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and a privateer, he would have faced a grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide himself. Once he was spotted and chased by a group of Spanish sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to notice him. The would-be captors then gave up and sailed away.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=125}}\n\n===Rescue===\n[[File:Serkirk being taken aboard the Duke.jpg|thumb|alt=Selkirk, seated in a ship's boat, being taken aboard ''Duke''.|The rescued Selkirk, seated at right, being taken aboard ''Duke''.]]\nSelkirk's long-awaited deliverance came on 2 February 1709 by way of ''Duke'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=124\u2013125}} a privateering ship [[maritime pilot|piloted]] by William Dampier, and its sailing companion ''Duchess''.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=6}} [[Thomas Dover]] led the landing party that met Selkirk.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=124}} After four years and four months without human company, Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=129}} The ''Duke''{{'s}} captain and leader of the expedition was [[Woodes Rogers]], who mischievously referred to Selkirk as the governor of the island. The agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of Rogers' men, who were suffering from [[scurvy]].{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nCaptain Rogers was impressed by Selkirk's physical vigour, but also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island, observing: \"One may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was.\"{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=130}} He made Selkirk ''Duke''{{'}}s [[second mate]], later giving him command of one of their prize ships, ''Increase'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=147}} before it was ransomed by the Spanish.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=220}}\n\nSelkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance. At [[Guayaquil]] in present-day Ecuador, he led a boat crew up the [[Guayas River]] where a number of wealthy Spanish ladies had fled, and looted the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|pp=178\u2013179}} His part in the hunt for treasure [[Manila galleon|galleons]] along the coast of Mexico resulted in the capture of ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Encarnaci\u00f3n y Desenga\u00f1o|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Encarnaci\u00f3n y Desenga\u00f1o]]'',{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=294}} renamed ''Bachelor'', on which he served as sailing master under Captain Dover to the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=312}} Selkirk completed the around-the-world voyage by the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as the sailing master of ''Duke'',{{sfnp|Cooke|1712|p=61}} arriving at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]] off the English coast on 1 October 1711.{{sfnp|Rogers|1712|p=427}} He had been away for eight years.{{sfnp|Funnell|1707|p=3}}\n\n==Later life and influence==\n[[File:Robinson svensk1732.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Engraving of Robinson Crusoe standing on the shore of an island, dressed in hair-covered goatskin clothing|An illustration of [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] in goatskin clothing shows the influence of Selkirk]]\nSelkirk's experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in England.

The current GMD system is intended to shield the United States mainland against a limited nuclear attack by a [[rogue state]] such as North Korea. GMD does not have the ability to protect against an all-out nuclear attack from Russia, as there are currently 44 ground-based interceptors deployed against crossing projectiles headed toward the homeland.

Under the lend-lease program, 200 US [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm AA]] guns with [[SCR-584 radar]]s and [[Western Electric]]/[[Bell Labs]] computers were sent to the UK. These demonstrated a 95% success rate against V-1s that flew into their range.<ref name=cav>Gregory Canavan, [http://missilethreat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/20030000-Heritage-canavan.pdf \"Missile Defense for the 21st Century\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713192027/http://missilethreat.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/20030000-Heritage-canavan.pdf |date=13 July 2015 }}, Heritage Foundation, 2003, p.3</ref>\n\nThe V-2, the first true ballistic missile, was impossible to destroy in the air. SCR-584's could be used to plot the trajectories of the missiles and provide some warning, but were more useful in backtracking their ballistic trajectory and determining the rough launch locations. The Allies launched [[Operation Crossbow]] to find and destroy V-2s before launch, but these operations were largely ineffective. In one instance a Spitfire happened upon a V-2 rising through the trees, and fired on it with no effect.<ref name=cav/> This led to allied efforts to capture launching sites in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nA wartime study by Bell Labs into the task of shooting down ballistic missiles in flight concluded it was not possible. In order to intercept a missile, one needs to be able to steer the attack onto the missile before it hits. A V-2's speed would require guns of effectively infinite reaction time, or some sort of weapon with ranges on the order of dozens of miles, neither of which appeared possible. This was, however, just before the emergence of high-speed computing systems. By the mid-1950s, things had changed considerably, and many forces worldwide were considering ABM systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. [[Project Wizard]] began in 1946, with the aim of creating a missile capable of intercepting the V-2.\n\nBut defences against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in ICBM technology with the launch of [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]], the Earth's first artificial satellite. The [[US Army]] accelerated development of their [[LIM-49 Nike Zeus]] system in response. Zeus was criticized throughout its development program, especially from those within the [[US Air Force]] and nuclear weapons establishments who suggested it would be much simpler to build more nuclear warheads and guarantee [[mutually assured destruction]]. Zeus was eventually cancelled in 1963.\n\nIn 1958, the U.S. sought to explore whether airbursting nuclear weapons might be used to ward off ICBMs. It conducted several test explosions of low-yield [[nuclear weapon]]s \u2014 1.7kt boosted fission [[W25 (nuclear warhead)|W25 warheads]] \u2014 launched from ships to very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic Ocean.<ref>Nuclear Weapon Archive.org. [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Argus.html Argus].</ref> Such an explosion releases a burst of [[X-ray]]s in the Earth's atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. These can become trapped in the Earth' magnetic field, creating an artificial radiation belt. It was believed that this might be strong enough to damage warheads traveling through the layer. This proved not to be the case, but [[Operation Argus|Argus]] returned key data about a related effect, the [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] (NEMP).\n\n===Canada===\nOther countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at [[DRE Valcartier|CARDE]] in Canada, which researched the main problems of ABM systems. A key problem with any radar system is that the signal is in the form of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like ABM systems, the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a [[terminal guidance]] system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced [[infrared]] detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was [[Gerald Bull]]'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a [[sabot]] round, which would later be the basis of [[Project HARP]]. Another was the [[CRV7]] and [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]] rockets, which used the new solid rocket fuel.\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:V-1000 ABM prototype.svg|thumb|V-1000]]\nThe Soviet military had requested funding for ABM research as early as 1953, but were only given the go-ahead to begin deployment of such a system on 17 August 1956. Their test system, known simply as System A, was based on the V-1000 missile, which was similar to the early US efforts. The first successful test interception was carried out on 24 November 1960, and the first with a live warhead on 4 March 1961. In this test, a dummy warhead was released by a [[R-12 (missile)|R-12]] [[ballistic missile]] launched from the [[Kapustin Yar]],<ref name=gobarev>{{cite journal |last1=Gobarev |first1=Victor |year=2001 |title=The early development of Russia's ballistic missile defense system |journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=29\u201348|doi=10.1080/13518040108430478}} Viewed 26 May 2012.</ref> and intercepted by a V-1000 launched from  [[Sary-Shagan]]. The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 16,000 [[tungsten-carbide]] spherical [[impactors]] 140 seconds after launch, at an altitude of {{convert|25|km|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Karpenko1999\">{{Cite journal| first = A| last = Karpenko| year = 1999| title = ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE| journal = Nevsky Bastion| volume = 4| pages = 2\u201347| url = https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/soviet/990600-bmd-rus.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favour of nuclear-armed ABMs. A much larger missile, the [[ABM-1 Galosh|Fakel 5V61]] (known in the west as Galosh), was developed to carry the larger warhead and carry it much further from the launch site. Further development continued, and the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]], designed to protect Moscow, became operational in 1971. A-35 was designed for exoatmospheric interceptions, and would have been highly susceptible to a well-arranged attack using multiple warheads and radar black-out techniques.\n\nA-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system, the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the [[53T6|Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3)]] short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. The A-135 system is considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975.<ref>GlobalSecurity.org. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/abm3.htm -135 anti-ballistic missile system].</ref>\n\n===American Nike-X and Sentinel===\n[[Nike Zeus]] failed to be a credible defence in an era of rapidly increasing ICBM counts due to its ability to attack only one target at a time. Additionally, significant concerns about its ability to successfully intercept warheads in the presence of high-altitude nuclear explosions, including its own, lead to the conclusion that the system would simply be too costly for the very low amount of protection it could provide.\n\nBy the time it was cancelled in 1963, potential upgrades had been explored for some time. Among these were radars capable of scanning much greater volumes of space and able to track many warheads and launch several missiles at once. These, however, did not address the problems identified with radar blackouts caused by high-altitude explosions. To address this need, a new missile with extreme performance was designed to attack incoming warheads at much lower altitudes, as low as 20&nbsp;km. The new project encompassing all of these upgrades was launched as [[Nike-X]].\n\nThe main missile was [[LIM-49 Spartan]]\u2014a Nike Zeus upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megaton warhead intended to destroy enemy's warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources{{who|date=March 2015}} claimed it accelerated to 8,000&nbsp;mph (13&nbsp;000&nbsp;km/h) within 4 seconds of flight\u2014an average acceleration of ''90 [[g-force|g]]'') and had a smaller W66 [[Neutron bomb|enhanced radiation]] warhead in the 1\u20133 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions.\n\nThe experimental success of Nike X persuaded the [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administration to propose a thin ABM defense, that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] referred to it as \"[[Sentinel program|Sentinel]]\". McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see [[cost-exchange ratio]]), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union's missiles (since the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn the meantime, a public debate over the merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack. One problem was the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]] (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.\n\nWhen this proved infeasible for economic reasons, a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed, namely Safeguard (described later).\n\n===Defense against MIRVs===\n[[File:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles, all eight shot from only one missile. Each line represents the path of a warhead which, were it live, would detonate with the explosive power of twenty-five [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-style]] weapons.]]\nABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, the price of the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn practice, the price of the interceptor missile was considerable, due to its sophistication. The system had to be guided all the way to an interception, which demanded guidance and control systems that worked within and outside the atmosphere. The Nike Zeus was expected to cost about $1 million{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, about the same as an ICBM{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. However, due to their relatively short ranges, an ABM missile would be needed to counter an ICBM wherever it might be aimed. That implies that dozens of interceptors are needed for every ICBM.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This led to intense debates about the \"[[cost-exchange ratio]]\" between interceptors and warheads.\n\nConditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]] (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly, each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. These would spread out in space, ensuring that a single interceptor would be needed for each warhead. This simply added to the need to have several interceptors for each warhead in order to provide geographical coverage. Now it was clear that an ABM system would always be many times more expensive than the ICBMs they defended against{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.\n\n===The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972===\n{{main|Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}}\nTechnical, economic and political problems described resulted in the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]] of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) anti-ballistic missiles.\n\nBy the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single, small area. The Soviets retained their Moscow defences. The U.S. designated their ICBM sites near Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where Safeguard was already under advanced development. The radar systems and anti-ballistic missiles were approximately 90 miles north/northwest of Grand Forks AFB, near Concrete, North Dakota. The missiles were deactivated in 1975. The main radar site (PARCS) is still used as an early warning ICBM radar, facing relative north. It is located at Cavalier Air Force Station, North Dakota.\n\n===Brief use of Safeguard in 1975/1976===\nThe U.S. [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard]] system, which utilized the nuclear-tipped [[LIM-49A Spartan]] and [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missiles, in the short operational period of 1975/1976, was the second counter-ICBMs system in the world. Safeguard protected only the main fields of US ICBMs from attack, theoretically ensuring that an attack could be responded to with a US launch, enforcing the [[mutually assured destruction]] principle.\n\n===SDI experiments in the 1980s===\n{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}\nThe [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (often referred to as \"Star Wars\"), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies.\n\nSDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray [[laser]]s were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).\n\nLasers originally developed for the SDI plan are in use for astronomical observations. Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere, they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Military Magic Boosts Astronomy : Declassified technology enhances celestial knowledge|journal=Astronomy|date=January 2001|volume=29|issue=1|page=48|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=d2b37e4a-4a62-4a05-8cc7-7521f023995e%40sessionmgr101&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=edsgcl.75029301&db=edsgbc|accessdate=26 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Tactical ABMs deployed in 1990s===\nThe Israeli [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]] system was tested initially during 1990, before the [[first Gulf War]]. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s.\n\nThe [[Patriot missile|Patriot]] was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi [[Scud]] missiles. Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry.\n\n<!--[https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/nmd/index.html FAS] also has a time line for ABM/NMB/TBMD starting in [https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones]-->\nTesting ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success. After the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. A new Patriot, [[PAC-3]], was developed and tested\u2014a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war, including a totally new missile.\nThe improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Patriot PAC-3s had a nearly 100% success rate against Iraqi TBMs fired. However, since no longer range Iraqi Scud missiles were used, PAC-3 effectiveness against those was untested. Patriot was involved in three [[friendly fire]] incidents: two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery.<ref>Defense Science Board Task Force.

Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures, but successful intercepts occurred from 1999 onward.  Full fielding of the first THAAD battery began in 2009.<ref>[http://newsblaze.com/usnews/military/first-battery-of-thaad-weapon-system-activated-at-fort-bliss_78215/ \"First Battery of THAAD Weapon System Activated at Fort Bliss\"]. Lockheed Martin via ''newsblaze'', 28 May 2008</ref>\n\n===Brilliant Pebbles concept===\nApproved for acquisition by the Pentagon during 1991 but never realized, [[Brilliant Pebbles]] was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that was meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.\nIt promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.\n\nThe name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.\n\n===Transformation of SDI into MDA, development of NMD/GMD===\nWhile the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President [[George H. W. Bush]] called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. Such system was developed since 1992, was expected to become operational in 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/gmd.html|publisher=MDA|accessdate=8 February 2011|quote=\"A total of 30 interceptors are planned for deployment by the end of 2010. \"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206200507/http://www.mda.mil/system/gmd.html|archivedate=6 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs. First called the National Missile Defense (NMD), since 2002 it was renamed [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD). It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System or by ground-based missiles in other locations.\n\nDuring 1998, Defense secretary [[William Cohen]] proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.<ref>PBS. [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]].

In 2002, it was renamed to [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).\n\n===U.S withdrawal from Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002===\nOn 13 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and recommenced developing missile defense systems that would have formerly been prohibited by the bilateral treaty. The action was stated as needed to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a [[rogue state]].\n\nThe next day, the Russian Federation dropped the [[START II]] agreement, intended to completely ban [[MIRV]]s.\n\n===ABM test targets===\nOn 15 December 2016, the US Army [[SMDC]] had a successful test of a U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket, to be used as a target for exercising various anti-ballistic missile scenarios. The rocket was launched as part of NASA's [[sounding rocket]] program, at White Sands Missile Range.<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/179788/us_army_announces_successful_test_of_us_army_zombie_pathfinder_rocket U.S. Army announces successful test of U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket] accessdate=2017-01-08</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Missile defense]]\n* [[Iron Dome]]\n* [[National Missile Defense]]\n* [[Nuclear disarmament]]\n* [[Nuclear proliferation]]\n* [[Nuclear warfare]]\n* [[Atmospheric entry]]\n* [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]]\n* [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]]\n* [[Sprint (missile)]]\n* [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan (missile)]]\n* [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard/Sentinel ABM system]]\n* [[Multiple Kill Vehicle]]\n* [[2010 Chinese anti-ballistic missile test]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Clark A.

While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840&nbsp;square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based.

A [[square]] enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57&nbsp;yards, or 208&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp;inches ({{convert|208.71|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=out}}) on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560&nbsp;square feet is an acre.\n\n==Differences between international and US survey acres==\nIn the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144&nbsp;metres.<ref>National Bureau of Standards. (1959). [http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound].</ref> By inference, an \"international acre\" may be declared as exactly {{gaps|4,046.856|422|4}}&nbsp;square metres but it does not have a basis in any international agreement.\n\nBoth the international acre and the US survey acre contain {{frac|640}} of a square mile or 4,840&nbsp;square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see [[Foot (unit)#Survey foot|survey foot]] and [[Yard#Conversions|survey yard]]), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about {{gaps|4,046.872|609|874|252}} square metres; its exact value ({{sfrac|4046|13,525,426|15,499,969}}&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) is based on an inch defined by 1&nbsp;metre = 39.37&nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the [[Mendenhall Order]]. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.<ref>[[National Geodetic Survey]], (January 1991), \"[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/Policy/st_plane.html Policy of the National Geodetic Survey Concerning Units of Measure for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983].</ref>\n\nSince the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016&nbsp;square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8&nbsp;square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed.

The full field, including the end zones, covers about {{convert|1.32|acres|2|abbr=on}}.\n\nFor residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide [[Association football pitch|association football (soccer) pitch]].\n\nIt may also be remembered as 44,000&nbsp;square feet, less 1%.\n\n== Historical origin ==\n{{Anthropic_Farm_Units}}\nThe word \"acre\" is derived from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00e6cer}} originally meaning \"open field\", [[cognate]] to west coast Norwegian {{lang|no|\u00e6kre}} and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] {{lang|sv|\u00e5ker}}, German {{lang|de|Acker}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|akker}}, [[Latin]] {{lang|la|ager}}, [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|ajr}}, and Greek {{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|el-Latn|agros}}). In English, it was historically spelled ''[[wikt:aker|aker]]''.\n\nA possible wording of the [[Act on the Composition of Yards and Perches]], dating from around 1300, is:\n<blockquote>It is ordained that 3 [[barleycorn (unit)|grains of barley]] dry and round do make an [[inch]], 12 inches make 1 [[foot (unit)|foot]], 3 feet make 1 yard, 5 yards and a half make a [[perch (unit)|perch]], and 40 perches in length and 4 in breadth make an '''acre'''.</blockquote>\n\nThe acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/1769|title=acre, n.|encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | date = December 2011}}</ref> This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one [[chain (length)|chain]] and one [[furlong]]. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word \"furlong\" itself derives from the fact that it is one [[Plough|furrow]] long.\n\nBefore the enactment of the [[metric system]], many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries: for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221&nbsp;square metres,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} whereas in Germany there were many variants of \"acre\", differing between the German states:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000&nbsp;acres of land, not 50&nbsp;square miles of land.\n\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640&nbsp;acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280&nbsp;feet (1760&nbsp;yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of {{frac|1|2}} mile (880&nbsp;yards) and is {{frac|1|4}} square mile in area, or 160&nbsp;acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being {{frac|1|4}} mile long, and being {{frac|1|16}} of a square mile in area, or 40&nbsp;acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \"the back 40\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the [[Canadian Prairie Provinces]] and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.\n\n==Legacy acres==\n* '''Customary acre''' \u2013 The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in [[carucate]]s, [[virgate]]s, [[Oxgang|bovates]], nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.\n* '''Builder's acre''' \u2013 In US construction and real estate development, an area of 40,000&nbsp;square feet.

Two equivalents of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]].

Phase 1, \"the preparatory phase\", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in the Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as \"Priming Steps\". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates . In Step 7, two ATP are produced. In addition, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs are formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.  \n\n=====Regulation=====\nIn glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&nbsp;\u2013 the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.<ref name=\"Voet\" /> A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.<ref name=Voet/>\n\n====Citric acid cycle====\n{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}\n\nIn the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate,  three equivalents of [[NADH]], and one equivalent of [[Flavin group|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are recycled (to NAD<sup>+</sup> and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively), generating additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2\u20133 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH<sub>2</sub> yields between 1\u20132 equivalents of ATP.<ref name=Rich/> The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O<sub>2</sub> is used to recycle the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.<ref name=Lodish/>\n\nThe generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[glycerol-phosphate shuttle]]) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup>. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD<sup>+</sup>.

ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane's electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H<sup>+</sup>. One ATP costs about 3  H<sup>+</sup>. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires  4H<sup>+.</sup> The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.<ref name=Brandolin>{{cite journal |last1=Dahout-Gonzalez |first1=C. |last2=Nury |first2=H. |last3=Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet |first3=V. |last4=Lauquin |first4=G. |last5=Pebay-Peyroula |first5=E. |last6=Brandolin |first6=G. | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology | volume = 21 | pages = 242\u2013249 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/21/4/242 | issue = 4 }}</ref> This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient. After completing glycolysis, the Citric Acid Cycle, electrons transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30-38 ATP are produced per glucose. \n\n=====Regulation=====\nThe citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]]&nbsp;\u2013 the ion that gives its name to the cycle&nbsp;\u2013 is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.<ref name=Voet/>\n\n====Beta oxidation====\n{{Main|Beta-oxidation}}\nIn the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to [[acetyl-CoA]]. The pathway is called [[beta-oxidation]]. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are used  by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.  Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ronnett |first1=G. |last2=Kim |first2=E. |last3=Landree |first3=L. |last4=Tu |first4=Y. | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol.

Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]], and carbon dioxide.\n\n===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===\nATP can also be synthesized through several so-called \"replenishment\" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the [[ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family|ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase]] family.\n\n===ATP production during photosynthesis===\nIn plants, ATP is synthesized in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]].  The process is called photophosphorylation. The \"machinery\" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force.

However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.<ref name=\"mrever\" />\n\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971\u201374 competitions.<ref name=\"mrever\" /> In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,<ref name=\"mrever\" /> beating [[Franco Columbu]]. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.<ref name=\"mrever\" />\n\nMonths before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called ''[[Pumping Iron]].'' Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]]. [[Lou Ferrigno]] proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\n\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> Schwarzenegger was training for his role in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'', and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide [[color commentary]] for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.\n\n===Steroid use===\nSchwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]]s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that \"steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest.

Credited under the [[stage name]] \"Arnold Strong\", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] after production.<ref name=\"profilear\" /> His second film appearance was as a [[deaf-mute]] mob hitman in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film ''[[Stay Hungry (film)|Stay Hungry]]'' (1976), for which he won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor]]. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: \"It was very difficult for me in the beginning&nbsp;\u2013 I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long.

Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', but did not win the role because of his height. Later, [[Lou Ferrigno]] got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Ann-Margret]] in the 1979 comedy ''[[The Villain (1979 film)|The Villain]]''. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] as Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]].\n\n===Action superstar===\nSchwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the [[sword-and-sorcery]] epic ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' in 1982, which was a box-office hit.<ref name=\"katzfilm\" /> This was followed by a sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.<ref name=\"tessay\">{{cite news |first=Clark |last=Collis |title=EMPIRE ESSAY: The Terminator |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=Empire |accessdate=April 18, 2008}}</ref> In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, ''[[Rio Carnival|Carnival]] in Rio''.

He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985), ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' (1986), ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), and ''[[Red Heat]]'' (1988).\n\n[[File:Chth arnold schwarzenegger.jpg|thumb|Footprints and handprints of Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], with his famous catchphrase ''\"[[I'll be back]]\"'' written in.]]\n''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), a comedy with [[Danny DeVito]], also proved successful. ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10&nbsp;million and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the [[Philip K.

His next film, the comedy drama ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.\n\nThat same year, the comedy ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. It was followed by the action thriller ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'' (1996), the Christmas comedy ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'' (1996), and the comic book-based ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), in which he played the villain [[Mr. Freeze]]. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of ''Batman & Robin'', his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' (1999), later followed by the action films ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000) and ''[[Collateral Damage (film)|Collateral Damage]]'' (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office.

Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California.

Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020.
