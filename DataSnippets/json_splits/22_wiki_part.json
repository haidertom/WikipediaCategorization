The popularity of the sport inspired the semi-pro national baseball clubs in the 1860s.\n\n==Early history==\nThe earliest  mention of baseball in the U.S was a 1791 [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], ordinance banning the playing of baseball within {{convert|80|yd|m}} of the town meeting house.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Baseball|work=baseball.isport.com|publisher=iSport|url=http://baseball.isport.com/baseball-history/|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> In 1903, the British sportswriter [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] published an article speculating that baseball derived from a British game called [[rounders]], which Chadwick had played as a boy in England. But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed. Baseball, said Spalding, was fundamentally an American sport and began on American soil. To settle the matter, the two men appointed a commission, headed by Abraham Mills, the fourth president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The commission, which also included six other sports executives, labored for three years, after which it declared that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented the national pastime. This would have been a surprise to Doubleday. The late Civil War hero \"never knew that he had invented baseball\". [But] 15 years [after his death], he was anointed as the father of the game\", writes baseball historian John Thorn. The [[Doubleday myth|myth about Doubleday inventing the game of baseball]] actually came from a [[Colorado]] mining engineer.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/16/134570236/the-secret-history-of-baseballs-earliest-days |title=The 'Secret History' Of Baseball's Earliest Days |work=NPR |date=March 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=A \u2018215th birthday\u2019 for Pittsfield as baseball's \u2018Garden of Eden\u2019 | last=Ryan | first=Andrew | newspaper=The Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/09/a_215th_birthda.html | date=September 5, 2006 | accessdate=September 30, 2009 | quote=In 2004, baseball historian John Thorn discovered the 1791 town ordinance, putting Pittsfield's connection to baseball 48 years before Abner Doubleday accepted invention of the game in 1839 in Cooperstown, N.Y., where the National Baseball Hall of Fame now stands.

The club was founded on September 23, 1845, as a social club for the upper middle classes of New York City, and was strictly [[amateur]] until it disbanded. The club's by-laws committee, which included [[William R. Wheaton]] and [[William H. Tucker (baseball)|William H. Tucker]], formulated the ''Knickerbocker Rules'', which in large part dealt with organizational matters but which also laid out rules for playing the game.<ref name=totalb>{{Cite book| publisher = Sport Media Pub.| isbn = 189496327X| last = Thorn| first = John| title = Total baseball: the ultimate baseball encyclopedia| location = Wilmington, Delaware| date = 2004}}</ref>  One of the significant rules prohibited ''soaking'' or ''plugging'' the runner; under older rules, a fielder could put a runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball, similarly to the common schoolyard game of [[kickball]]. The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice. A recently discovered newspaper interview with Wheaton indicates that the rules he and Tucker wrote for the Knickerbockers in most respects duplicated the rules he had written for the Gotham Club in 1837; the Knickerbockers were founded as a breakaway group of former Gothams.\n\nWriting the rules did not help the Knickerbockers in the first known competitive game between two clubs under the new rules,  played at [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] on June 19, 1846. The  \"New York nine\" (almost certainly the parent Gotham Club) humbled the Knickerbockers by a score of 23 to 1. Nevertheless, the Knickerbocker Rules were rapidly adopted by teams in the New York area and their version of baseball became known as the \"New York Game\" (as opposed to the \"Massachusetts Game\", played by clubs in the Boston area).\n\nAs late as 1855, the New York press was still devoting more space to coverage of [[cricket]] than to baseball.<ref>{{cite book\n|page=56\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTZexfpmyDwC\n|title=Offside: soccer and American exceptionalism\n|first=Andrei S.\n|last=Markovits\n|author2=Steven L. Hellerman\n|publisher=Princeton University Press\n|year=2001\n|ISBN=0-691-07447-X\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1857, sixteen New York area clubs, including the Knickerbockers, formed the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP). The NABBP was the first organization to govern the sport and to establish a championship. The 1857 convention also established three key features of the game: 90 feet between the bases, 9-man teams, and 9-inning games (under the Knickerbocker Rules, games were played to 21 runs). Aided by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], membership grew to almost 100 clubs by 1865 and to over 400 by 1867, including clubs from as far away as [[California]]. During the Civil War, soldiers from different parts of the United States played baseball together, leading to a more unified national version of the sport. Beginning in 1869, the NABBP permitted [[professional]] play, addressing a growing practice that had not been permitted under its rules to that point. The first and most prominent professional club of the NABBP era was the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] in Ohio, which lasted only two years. Businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]] then courted manager Harry Wright and founded the \"Boston Red Stockings\" and the [[Boston Base Ball Club]]  on January 20, 1871.\n\nIn 1858, in the [[Corona, Queens|Corona]] neighborhood of [[Queens]] (now part of [[New York City]]), at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all stars of [[Brooklyn]], including players from the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic]], [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Excelsior]], Putnam and [[Eckford of Brooklyn|Eckford]] clubs, and the All Stars of New York ([[Manhattan]]), including players from the [[New York Knickerbockers]], Gothams, Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to the first all star baseball games.<ref>The 1858 Fashion Race Course Baseball Match, Baseball Almanac, http://www.baseball-almanac.com/treasure/autont2006b.shtml Accessed August 5, 2013</ref><ref>All Star Games of 1858 {{cite web|url=http://baseballhistoryblog.com/2725/all-star-games-of-1858 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016014635/http://baseballhistoryblog.com/2725/all-star-games-of-1858/ |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }} Accessed August 5, 2013</ref>\n\n==Growth==\nBefore the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], baseball competed for public interest with [[cricket]] and regional variants of baseball, notably [[town ball]] played in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Massachusetts Game]] played in [[New England]]. In the 1860s, aided by the war, [[Knickerbocker Rules|\"New York\" style]] baseball expanded into a national game. As its first governing body, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] was formed. The NABBP soon expanded into a true national organization, although most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country. In its 12-year history as an amateur league, the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic Club of Brooklyn]] won seven championships, establishing themselves as the first true dynasty in the sport, although [[New York Mutuals|Mutual of New York]] was widely considered to be one of the best teams of the era as well. By the end of [[1865 in baseball|1865]], almost 100 clubs were members of the NABBP.  By 1867, it ballooned to over 400 members, including some clubs from as far away as [[List of baseball parks in San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Louisiana]]. One of these clubs, the Chicago White Stockings, won the championship in 1870.  Today they are known as the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Because of this growth, regional and state organizations began to assume a more prominent role in the governance of the sport.\n\n==Professionalism==\n\nThe NABBP of America was initially established upon principles of [[amateurism]]. However, even early in its history some star players, such as [[Jim Creighton|James Creighton]] of [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Excelsior]], received compensation, either secretly or indirectly.  In [[1866 in sports|1866]], the NABBP investigated [[Athletic of Philadelphia]] for paying three players including [[Lip Pike]], but ultimately took no action against either the club or the players. To address this growing practice, and to restore integrity to the game, at its December [[1868 in sports|1868]] meeting the NABBP established a professional category for the [[1869 in sports|1869]] season. Clubs desiring to pay players were now free to declare themselves [[professional]].\n\nThe [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] were the first to so declare themselves as openly professional, and were easily the most aggressive in recruiting the best available players. Twelve clubs, including most of the strongest clubs in the NABBP, ultimately declared themselves professional for the [[1869 in sports|1869]] season.\n\nThe first attempt at forming a \"[[Major North American professional sports teams|major league]]\" produced the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], which lasted from 1871 to 1875.  The now all professional Chicago White Stockings, financed by businessman [[William Hulbert]], became a charter member of the league along with the Red Stockings, who had dissolved and moved to Boston. The White Stockings were close contenders all season, despite the fact that the [[Great Chicago Fire]] had destroyed the team's home field and most of their equipment. The White Stockings finished the season in second place, but ultimately were forced to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period, finally returning to National Association play in 1874. Over the next couple seasons, The [[Ivers Whitney Adams#Baseball|Boston Red Stockings]] dominated the league and hoarded many of the game's best players, even those who were under contract with other teams. After [[Davy Force]] signed with Chicago, and then breached his contract to play in Boston, Hulbert became discouraged by the \"contract jumping\" as well as the overall disorganization of the N.A., and thus spearheaded the movement to form a stronger organization. The end result of his efforts was the formation a much more \"ethical\" league, which became known as the [[National League|National Base Ball League]].  After a series of rival leagues were organized but failed (most notably the [[American Association (19th century)|American Base Ball Association]], which spawned the clubs which would ultimately become the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]), the current [[American League]], evolving from the minor Western League of 1893, was established in 1901.\n\n==Rise of the major leagues==\n[[Image:Pre-1900 MLB teams.png|thumb|400px|Cities that hosted 19th century MLB teams, with cities that still host their 19th century team in black. With the exception of a team in Washington and a few short-lived teams in Virginia and Kentucky, major league baseball would not expand out of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] until after World War II.]]\nIn 1870, a [[wikt:schism|schism]] developed between professional and amateur ballplayers. The NABBP split into two groups. The [[National Association of Professional Baseball Players|National Association of ''Professional'' Base Ball Players]] operated from 1871 through 1875, and is considered by some to have been the first major league. Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.\n\nWilliam Hulbert's National League, which was formed after the National Association proved ineffective, put its emphasis on \"clubs\" rather than \"players\". Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting scheduled games once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association. A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.\n\nAt the same time, a [[gentlemen's agreement]] was struck between the clubs to [[Baseball color line|exclude non-white players]] from professional baseball, a bar that remained until 1947. It is a common misconception that [[Jackie Robinson]] was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap (and the first in the modern era). [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] and his brother [[Weldy Walker]] were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans, and a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until the signing of Robinson (in the National League) and [[Larry Doby]] (in the American League) that baseball began to remove its color bar.\n\nThe early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated \"reserve clause\", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1881\u20131891), sometimes called the \"beer and whiskey league\" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series\u2014the first attempt at a [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe [[Union Association]] survived for only one season (1884), as did the [[Players' League]] (1890), an attempt to return to the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] structure of a league controlled by the players themselves. Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately \"stacked\" by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.\n\nIn fact, there were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League \"major\" was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball. The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.\n\nA number of other leagues, including the venerable Eastern League, threatened the dominance of the National League. The Western League, founded in 1893, became particularly aggressive. Its fiery leader [[Ban Johnson]] railed against the National League and promised to build a new league that would grab the best players and field the best teams. The Western League began play in April 1894 with teams in [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]] (the only league team that has not moved since), [[Cleveland Indians|Grand Rapids]], [[Oakland Athletics|Indianapolis]], [[Minnesota Twins|Kansas City]], [[Baltimore Orioles|Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis Millers|Minneapolis]], [[Chicago White Sox|Sioux City]] and [[Boston Red Sox|Toledo]]. Prior to the 1900 season, the league changed its name to the [[American League]] and moved several franchises to larger, strategic locations. In 1901 the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league.\n\nThe resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman [[Napoleon Lajoie]], who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the next year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.\n\nThe war between the American and National caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901 [[Patrick T. Powers]], president of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] announced the formation of the second [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], the NABPL or \"NA\" for short.\n\nThese leagues did not consider themselves \"minor\" \u2013 a term that did not come into vogue until St. Louis Cardinals GM [[Branch Rickey]] pioneered the farm system in the 1930s. Nevertheless, these financially troubled leagues, by beginning the practice of selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues, embarked on a path that eventually led to the loss of their independent status.\n\n[[Image:John E Sheridan Pennsylvania Georgetown Baseball c1901.jpg|thumb|300px|Poster for [[Penn Quakers|University of Pennsylvania]] vs. [[Georgetown University]] baseball game, circa 1901, by [[John E. Sheridan (illustrator)|John E. Sheridan]].]]\n\nBan Johnson had other designs for the NA. While the NA continues to this day, he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.\n\nAfter 1902 both leagues and the NABPL signed a new National Agreement which achieved three things:\n* First and foremost, it governed player contracts that set up mechanisms to end the cross-league raids on rosters and reinforced the power of the hated [[reserve clause]] that kept players virtual slaves to their baseball masters.\n* Second, it led to the playing of a \"[[Baseball/World Series|World Series]]\" in 1903 between the two major league champions. The first World Series was won by Boston of the American League.\n* Lastly, it established a system of control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents. There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion from the ranks of leagues with smaller cities. Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues. During the rough and tumble years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.\n\nThe new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought a player's skill set. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today.\n\nIt also gave the NA great power. Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.' The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.\n\nIn the very early part of the 20th century, known as the \"[[dead-ball era]]\", baseball rules and equipment favored the \"inside game\" and the game was played more violently and aggressively than it is today. This period ended in the 1920s with several changes that gave advantages to hitters. In the largest parks, the outfield fences were brought closer to the infield. In addition, the strict enforcement of new rules governing the size, shape and construction of the ball caused it to travel farther.\n\nThe first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. Subsequent professional black baseball clubs played each other independently, without an official league to organize the sport. [[Rube Foster]], a former ballplayer, founded the [[Negro National League (1920\u20131931)|Negro National League]] in 1920. A second league, the [[Eastern Colored League]], was established in 1923. These became known as the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]], though these leagues never had any formal overall structure comparable to the Major Leagues. The Negro National League did well until 1930, but folded during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nFrom 1942 to 1948, the [[Negro League World Series]] was revived. This was the golden era of Negro League baseball, a time when it produced some of its greatest stars. In [[1947 Major League Baseball season|1947]], [[Jackie Robinson]] signed a contract with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] that had prevented talented African American players from entering the white-only major leagues. Although the transformation was not instantaneous, baseball has since become fully [[racial integration|integrated]]. In 1948, the Negro Leagues faced financial difficulties that effectively ended their existence.\n\nPitchers dominated the game in the 1960s and early 1970s. In [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], the [[designated hitter]] (DH) rule was adopted by the American League, while in the National League pitchers still bat for themselves to this day. The DH rule now constitutes the primary difference between the two leagues.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Baseball Players Union]] became much stronger and conflicts between owners and the players' union led to major work stoppages in 1972, 1981, and 1994. The [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 baseball strike]] led to the cancellation of the World Series, and was not settled until the spring of 1995. In the late 1990s, functions that had been administered separately by the two major leagues' administrations were united under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\n==The dead-ball era: 1900 to 1919==\n[[Image:T205 Cy Young.jpg|thumb|Cy Young, 1911 baseball card]]\n[[Image:MLBteams1903to1953.png|thumb|400px|Cities that hosted MLB teams from 1903 to 1953; cities that hosted two teams are in black, cities that hosted one team are in red, and New York/Brooklyn, with three teams, is in orange. Major league baseball did not experience relocation or expansion between 1903 and [[Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s\u201360s|1953]].]]\n{{Main|Dead-ball era}}\n\nAt this time the games tended to be low scoring, dominated by such pitchers as [[Walter Johnson]], [[Cy Young]], [[Christy Mathewson]], and [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] to the extent that the period 1900\u20131919 is commonly called the \"Dead-ball era\". The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. Baseballs cost three dollars apiece, which in 1900 would be equal to ${{Inflation|US|3|1900}} today; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game. By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat. Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands\u2014a practice unthinkable today.\n\nAs a consequence, home runs were rare, and the \"inside game\" dominated\u2014singles, [[bunt (baseball)|bunts]], [[stolen base]]s, the hit-and-run play, and other tactics dominated the strategies of the time.\n\nDespite this, there were also several superstar hitters, the most famous being [[Honus Wagner]], held to be one of the greatest [[shortstop]]s to ever play the game, and Detroit's [[Ty Cobb]], the \"Georgia Peach.\" His career [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .366 has yet to be bested.\n\n===The Merkle incident===\nThe [[1908 Major League Baseball season|1908 pennant races]] in both the AL and NL were among the most exciting ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, often referred to as the Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the [[1908 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[1908 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] played a game in the [[Polo Grounds III|Polo Grounds]]. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman [[Fred Merkle]], later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, [[Johnny Evers]], noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the [[1908 World Series|World Series]] (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).\n\nFor his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse, which went down in history as \"[[Merkle's Boner]]\". In his defense, some baseball historians have suggested that it was not customary for game-ending hits to be fully \"run out\", it was only Evers's insistence on following the rules strictly that resulted in this unusual play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/Jaybird926/merkle.htm|title=Fred Merkle and the 1908 Giants|accessdate=June 19, 2006}}</ref> In fact, earlier in the 1908 season, the identical situation had been brought to the umpires' attention by Evers; the umpire that day was the same Hank O'Day. While the winning run was allowed to stand on that occasion, the dispute raised O'Day's awareness of the rule, and directly set up the Merkle controversy.<ref>Murphy, Cait.

The average for the 1,110 games in the [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901 season]] was 3,247.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/sports/baseball/mlb/ml_numbers.html |author=Kenn Tomasch |title=Historical attendance figures for Major League Baseball |date=May 24, 2005 |accessdate=June 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511134344/http://www.kenn.com/sports/baseball/mlb/ml_numbers.html |archivedate=May 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built for many of the larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Shibe Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Ebbets Field]] in [[Brooklyn]], the [[Polo Grounds III|Polo Grounds]] in [[Manhattan]], [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]] along with [[Wrigley Field]] and [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago. Likewise from the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising [[Negro Leagues]] professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in [[1909 Major League Baseball season|1909]].

Even baseball stars such as [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Tris Speaker]] have been credibly alleged to have fixed game outcomes. When MLB's complacency during this \"Golden Age\" was eventually exposed after the [[1919 World Series]], it became known as the [[Black Sox scandal]].\n\nAfter an excellent regular season (88\u201352, .629 W%), the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] were heavy favorites to win the 1919 World Series. Arguably the best team in baseball, the White Sox had a deep lineup, a strong pitching staff, and a good defense. Even though the National League champion [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] had a superior regular season record (96\u201344, .689 W%,) no one, including [[gamblers]] and [[bookmaker]]s, anticipated the Reds having a chance. When the Reds triumphed 5\u20133, many pundits cried foul.\n\nAt the time of the scandal, the White Sox were arguably the most successful franchise in baseball, with excellent gate receipts and record attendance. At the time, most baseball players were not paid especially well and had to work other jobs during the winter to survive. Some elite players on the big-city clubs made very good salaries, but Chicago was a notable exception.\n\nFor many years, the White Sox were owned and operated by [[Charles Comiskey]], who paid the lowest player salaries, on average, in the American League. The White Sox players all intensely disliked Comiskey and his penurious ways, but were powerless to do anything, thanks to baseball's so-called \"reserve clause\" that prevented players from switching teams without their team owner's consent.\n\nBy late 1919, Comiskey's tyrannical reign over the Sox had sown deep bitterness among the players, and White Sox first baseman [[Chick Gandil|Arnold \"Chick\" Gandil]] decided to conspire to throw the 1919 World Series.  He persuaded gambler [[Joseph \"Sport\" Sullivan]], with whom he had had previous dealings, that the fix could be pulled off for $100,000 total (which would be equal to ${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1919}}}} today), paid to the players involved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html |title=History Files \u2013 Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184407/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df= }}</ref>  New York gangster [[Arnold Rothstein]] supplied the $100,000 that Gandil had requested through his lieutenant [[Abe Attell]], a former featherweight [[boxing]] champion.\n\nAfter the 1919 series, and through the beginning of the [[1920 Major League Baseball season|1920 baseball season]], rumors swirled that some of the players had conspired to purposefully lose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk4a.html |title=History Files \u2013 Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317220102/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk4a.html |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df= }}</ref> At last, in 1920, a [[grand jury]] was convened to investigate these and other allegations of fixed baseball games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk5.html |title=History Files \u2013 Chicago Black Sox |publisher=Chicagohs.org |date=December 13, 2001 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317215232/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk5.html |archivedate=March 17, 2010 |df= }}</ref> Eight players ([[Swede Risberg|Charles \"Swede\" Risberg]], [[Chick Gandil|Arnold \"Chick\" Gandil]], [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson]], [[Happy Felsch|Oscar \"Happy\" Felsch]], [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Buck Weaver|George \"Buck\" Weaver]], [[Fred McMullin]], and [[Lefty Williams|Claude \"Lefty\" Williams]]) were indicted and tried for conspiracy.  The players were ultimately acquitted.\n\nHowever, the damage to the reputation of the sport of baseball led the team owners to appoint Federal judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] to be the first [[Commissioner of Baseball]].  His first act as commissioner was to ban the \"Black Sox\" from professional baseball for life.  The White Sox, meanwhile would not return to the World Series until 1959 and it was not until their next appearance in 2005 they won the World Series.\n\n==The Negro leagues==\n{{Main|Negro league baseball}}\nUntil July 5, 1947, baseball had two histories. One fills libraries, while baseball historians are only just beginning to chronicle the other fully. African Americans have played baseball as long as white Americans. Players of color, both [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], played for white baseball clubs throughout the early days of the organizing amateur sport. [[Moses Fleetwood Walker]] is considered the first African-American to play at the major league level, in 1884.\n\nThe '''[[Negro Leagues]]''' were American professional [[baseball]] leagues comprising predominantly African-American teams. The term may be used broadly to include professional black teams outside the leagues and it may be used narrowly for the [[#Significant Negro Leagues|seven relatively successful leagues beginning 1920]] that are sometimes termed \"Negro Major Leagues\".\n\nThe first professional team, established in [[1885 in baseball|1885]], achieved great and lasting success as the [[Cuban Giants]], while the first league, the [[National Colored Base Ball League]], failed in [[1887 in baseball|1887]] after only two weeks due to low attendance. The [[Negro American League]] of [[1951 in baseball|1951]] is considered the last major league season and the last professional club, the [[Indianapolis Clowns]], operated amusingly rather than competitively from the mid-1960s to 1980s.\n\n===The first international leagues===\nWhile many of the players that made up the black baseball teams were African-Americans, many more were [[Latin Americans]] from nations that deliver some of the greatest talents that make up the major league rosters of today. Black players moved freely through the rest of baseball, playing in Canadian Baseball, [[Mexican Baseball]], Caribbean Baseball, and Central America and South America where more than a few found that level of fame that they were unable to attain in the country of their birth.\n\n==Babe Ruth and the end of the dead-ball era==\n[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1920.]]\n[[Image:MLB attendance vs population.png|thumb|Graph depicting the yearly MLB attendance versus total U.S. population|250px|right]]\n{{see also|Golden age of baseball}}\nIt was not the Black Sox scandal which put an end to the dead-ball era, but a rule change and a single player.\n\nSome of the increased offensive output can be explained by the 1920 rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce \"spitballs\", \"shine balls\" and other trick pitches which had \"unnatural\" flight through the air. Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of [[Ray Chapman]], who was struck in the temple by a pitched ball from [[Carl Mays]] in a game on August 16, 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since. There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage to the balls, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.\n\nAt the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]], sold a group of his star players to the [[New York Yankees]]. Amongst them was [[Babe Ruth|George Herman Ruth]], known affectionately as \"Babe\". The story that Frazee did so in order to fund theatrical shows on Broadway for his actress lady friend is unfounded. [[No, No, Nanette]] was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]] had occurred five years earlier. In the lore of the [[Curse of the Bambino]], Frazee supposedly needed to sell Ruth among other reasons to make up for his lack of financial success up to that point in making Broadway shows, and it was hitting it big with ''No, No, Nanette'' in 1925 that paid off the loan.\n\nRuth's career mirrors the shift in dominance from pitching to hitting at this time. He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game. When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked. It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day. Ruth swatted 29 home runs in his last season in Boston. The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in 1921 he hit 59. His 1927 mark of 60 home runs would last until 1961.\n\n[[File:Hank Greenberg 1937 cropped.jpg|thumb |Hall of Famer [[Hank Greenberg]]]]\nRuth's power hitting ability demonstrated a new way to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds. Accordingly, the ballparks were expanded, sometimes by building outfield seating which shrunk the size of the outfield and made home run hitting more practical. In addition to Ruth, hitters such as [[Rogers Hornsby]] also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s. By the late 1920s and 1930s all the good teams had their home run hitting \"sluggers\": the Yankees' [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Jimmie Foxx]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Hank Greenberg]] in [[Detroit]] and Chicago's [[Hack Wilson]] were the most storied. While the American League championship, and to a lesser extent the [[Baseball/World Series|World Series]], would be dominated by the Yankees, there were many other excellent teams in the inter-war years. Also, the National League's [[St. Louis Cardinals]] would win three titles themselves in nine years, the last with a group of players known as the \"[[Gashouse Gang]]\".\n\nThe first radio broadcast of a baseball game was on August 5, 1921 over Westinghouse station KDKA from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. Harold Arlin announced the Pirates-Phillies game. Attendances in the 1920s were consistently better than they had been before the war. The interwar peak average attendance was 8,211 in 1930, but baseball was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]] and in 1933 the average fell below five thousand for the only time between the wars.\n\n1933 also saw the introduction of the All-Star game, a mid-season break in which the greatest players in each league play against one another in a hard-fought but officially meaningless demonstration game. In 1936 the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] was instituted and five players elected: [[Ty Cobb]], [[Walter Johnson]], [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Honus Wagner]]. The Hall formally opened in 1939.\n\n==The war years==\nIn 1941, a year which saw the premature death of [[Lou Gehrig]], Boston's great left fielder [[Ted Williams]] had a batting average over .400 \u2013 the last time anyone has achieved that feat. During the same season [[Joe DiMaggio]] hit successfully in 56 consecutive games, an accomplishment both unprecedented and unequaled.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War II]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Landis asked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] whether professional baseball should continue during the war. In the \"Green Light Letter\", the US president replied that baseball was important to national morale, and asked for more night games so day workers could attend. Thirty-five Hall of Fame members and more than 500 Major League Baseball players served in the war, but with the exception of [[D-Day]], games continued.<ref name=\"ivice20040606\">{{Cite news |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2004/m06/d06/c762644.jsp |title=Berra, baseball have D-Day legacy |last=Ivice |first=Paul |date=2004-06-06 |work=MLB.com |access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref> Both Williams and DiMaggio would miss playing time in the services, with Williams also flying later in the [[Korean War]]. During this period [[Stan Musial]] led the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to the 1942, 1944 and 1946 World Series titles. The war years also saw the founding of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]].\n\nBaseball boomed after World War II. 1945 saw a new attendance record and the following year average crowds leapt nearly 70% to 14,914. Further records followed in 1948 and 1949, when the average reached 16,913. While average attendances slipped to somewhat lower levels through the 1950s, 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, they remained well above pre-war levels, and total seasonal attendance regularly hit new highs from 1962 onwards as the number of major league games increased.\n\n==Racial integration in baseball{{anchor | Racial integration in baseball}}==<!--This section is linked by [[Jackie Robinson]]-->\n{{Further|baseball color line|Jackie Robinson}}\nThe post-War years in baseball also witnessed the racial integration of the sport. Participation by [[African American]]s in organized baseball had been precluded since the 1890s by formal and informal agreements, with only a few players surreptitiously being included in lineups on a sporadic basis.\n\nAmerican society as a whole moved toward integration in the post-War years, partially as a result of the distinguished service by [[African American]] military units such as the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], [[366th Infantry Regiment]], and others. During the baseball winter meetings in 1943, noted [[African American]] athlete and actor [[Paul Robeson]] campaigned for integration of the sport.<ref name=West>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/pdf/hs_in_robinson_rickey.pdf |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson, Interview Essay |accessdate=April 15, 2009 |first=Jean |last=West |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412165845/http://jimcrowhistory.org/resources/pdf/hs_in_robinson_rickey.pdf |archivedate=April 12, 2007 |df= }}</ref> After World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II ended, several team managers considered recruiting members of the [[Negro Leagues]] for entry into organized baseball. In the early 1920s, [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] slipped a black player, [[Charlie Grant]], into his lineup (reportedly by passing him off to the front office as an Indian), and McGraw's wife reported finding names of dozens of Negro players that McGraw fantasized about signing, after his death. [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] owner Bill Bensawanger reportedly signed [[Josh Gibson]] to a contract in 1943, and the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] were also said to be interested in his services. But those efforts (and others) were opposed by [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], baseball's powerful commissioner and a staunch segregationist{{Citation needed|reason=Need evidence that he was a segregationist|date=October 2017}}. [[Bill Veeck]] made the (now often disputed claimed<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jordan, Gerlach, Rossi|title=A Baseball Myth Exploded|url=http://www.sabr.org/|website=Society For American baseball Research|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>) that Landis blocked his purchase of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] because he planned to integrate the team. While this is disputed, Landis was opposed to integration, and his death in 1944 (and subsequent replacement as Commissioner by [[Happy Chandler]]) removed a major obstacle for black players in the major leagues.\n\nThe general manager who would be eventually successful in breaking the color barrier was [[Branch Rickey]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey was able to get the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Rickey had compiled a list of Negro League ballplayers for a potential major league contract. Realizing that the first [[African American]] signee would be a magnet for prejudicial sentiment, however, Rickey was intent on finding a player with a distinguished personality and character that would allow him to tolerate the inevitable abuse. Rickey's sights eventually settled on [[Jackie Robinson]], a shortstop with the [[Kansas City Monarchs]]. Although probably not the best player in the Negro Leagues at the time, Robinson was an exceptional talent, was college-educated, and had the marketable distinction of serving as an officer during World War II. More importantly, Robinson possessed the inner strength to handle the inevitable abuse to come.  To prepare him for the task, Robinson first played in 1946 for the Dodgers' [[minor league]] team, the [[Montreal Royals]], which proved an arduous emotional challenge, but he also enjoyed fervently enthusiastic support from the [[Montreal]] fans.  On April 15, 1947, Robinson broke the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]], which had been tacitly recognized for over 50 years, with his appearance for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] at [[Ebbets Field]].\n\nEleven weeks later, on July 5, 1947, the [[American League]] was integrated by the signing of [[Larry Doby]] to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. Over the next few years a handful of black baseball players made appearances in the majors, including [[Roy Campanella]] (teammate to Robinson in Brooklyn) and [[Satchel Paige]] (teammate to Doby in Cleveland).<ref name=break>{{cite web |url=http://coe.ksu.edu/nlbemuseum/resource/lps/BarrierBreakers.pdf |title=Barrier Breakers (Negro League Baseball Museum)}}</ref> Paige, who had pitched more than 2400 innings in the Negro Leagues, sometimes two and three games a day, was still effective at 42, and still playing at 59. His ERA in the Major Leagues was 3.29.\n\nHowever, the initial pace of [[Racial integration|integration]] was slow. By 1953, only six of the sixteen major league teams had a black player on the roster.<ref name=\"P111\">[[#Powers|Powers]] (2003), p. 111.</ref> The [[Boston Red Sox]] became the last major league team to integrate its roster with the addition of [[Pumpsie Green]] on July 21, 1959.<ref>{{cite web|last=Handy|first=Delores|title=Segregation A Troubling Part Of Fenway's History|url=http://www.wbur.org/2012/04/18/fenway-segregation|work=wbur.org|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>  While limited in numbers, the on-field performance of early black major league players was outstanding. In the fourteen years from 1947\u20131960, black players won one or more of the [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] awards nine times.<ref name=break/>\n\nWhile never prohibited in the same fashion as African Americans, [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] players also benefitted greatly from the integration era. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born [[Chico Carrasquel]] and Cuban-born (and black) [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]], became the first Hispanic [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]].<ref name=\"P111\"/>\n\nAccording to some baseball historians, Robinson and the other African American players helped reestablish the importance of baserunning and similar elements of play that were previously de-emphasized by the predominance of power hitting.\n\nFrom 1947 to the 1970s, African American participation in baseball rose steadily. By 1974, 27% of baseball players were African American.<ref name=Lee>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/Story?id=3001708&page=1 |title=Where Are the Blacks in Major League baseball? |date=April 2, 2007 |first=Rebecca |last=Lee}}</ref> As a result of this on-field experience, minorities began to experience long-delayed gains in managerial positions within baseball. In 1975, [[Frank Robinson]] (who had been the 1956 [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]) was named player-manager of the [[Cleveland Indians]], making him the first African American manager in the major leagues.\n\nAlthough these front-office gains continued, Major League Baseball saw a lengthy slow decline in the percentage of black players after the mid-1970s. By 2007, black players made up less than 9% of the major leagues. While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on the recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/aug/13/blacks-hispanics-not-on-the-same-team/ |work=Washington Times |title=Blacks, Hispanics not on the same team |date=2007-08-13 | accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9561056 |title=Frank Robinson on Jackie Robinson's Legacy |accessdate=2008-11-24 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2007-04-13}}</ref>), other factors have been cited as well.

It evolved into the [[Pacific Coast League]], which included the [[Hollywood Stars]], [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]], [[Portland Beavers]], [[Sacramento Solons]], [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]], [[Seattle Rainiers]].\n\nThe PCL was huge in the West. A member of the [[Minor League Baseball|National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues]], it kept losing great players to the National and the American leagues for less than $8,000 a player.\n\nThe PCL was far more independent than the other \"minor\" leagues, and rebelled continuously against their Eastern masters. Clarence [[Pants Rowland]], the President of the PCL, took on baseball commissioners [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] and [[Happy Chandler]] at first to get better equity from the major leagues, then to form a third major league. His efforts were rebuffed by both commissioners. Chandler and several of the owners, who saw the value of the markets in the West, started to plot the extermination of the PCL. They had one thing that Rowland did not: The financial power of the Eastern major league baseball establishment.\n\nNo one was going to back a PCL club building a major-league size stadium if the National or the American League was going to build one too, and potentially put the investment in the PCL ballpark into jeopardy.\n\n===1953\u20131955===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-style=\"background:lime;\"\n|colspan=\"5\"|'''''Before Expansion:'' The Major Leagues, 1901 to 1960'''\n|-\n| ''(move)''\n| style=\"background:blue; color:white\"|&nbsp;'''National League'''&nbsp;\n| '''City'''\n|style=\"background:red; color:white\"|&nbsp;'''American League'''&nbsp;\n| ''(move)''\n|-\n| ''to Milwaukee 1953 \u2190 ''\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|[[Atlanta Braves|Braves]]\n| bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Boston'''\n| style=\"background:pink\"|[[Red Sox]]\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| style=\"background:lightblue\"|[[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]]\n| bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Philadelphia'''\n| style=\"background:pink\"|[[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]]\n| '' \u2192 to Kansas City 1955''\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; '' to San Francisco 1958 \u2190 '' &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:lightblue;\"|[[New York Giants (NL)|Giants]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''New York City'''\n|style=\"background:pink;\"|[[New York Yankees|Yankees]]\n| <small>''[ \u2190 Baltimore Orioles 1901-2 ]''</small>\n|-\n| '' to Los Angeles 1958 \u2190 ''\n|style=\"background:lightblue;\"|[[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Brooklyn'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Washington, D.C.'''\n|style=\"background:pink;\"|[[Minnesota Twins|Senators]]'''\n|'' \u2192 Minnesota Twins 1961 ''\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:lightblue;\"|[[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Pittsburgh'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|style=\"background:lightblue;\"|[[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Cincinnati'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Cleveland'''\n|style=\"background:pink\"|[[Cleveland Indians|Indians]]'''\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Detroit'''\n|style=\"background:pink\"|[[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]]'''\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n|style=\"background:lightblue\"|[[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''Chicago'''\n|style=\"background:pink\"|[[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n|style=\"background:lightblue\"|[[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]\n|bgcolor=\"lemonchiffon\"|'''St. Louis'''\n|style=\"background:pink\"|[[St. Louis Browns|Browns]]\n| ''<small>[ \u2190 Milwaukee Brewers 1901 ]</small>''<br>\u2192 ''Baltimore Orioles 1954''\n|-style=\"background:lightyellow\"\n|colspan=\"5\"|''New Major League homes, 1953 to 1960''\n|-\n| Former city\n|'''[[National League]]'''\n| New city\n|'''[[American League]]'''\n| Former city\n|-\n|''Boston 1871 \u2192<br><small>[ to Atlanta 1966 \u2190 ]</small>''\n|style=\"background:#acf\"|[[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] (1953)\n|bgcolor=\"lightyellow\"|'''Milwaukee'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| bgcolor=\"lightyellow\"|'''Baltimore'''\n| style=\"background:#fbd;\"|[[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] (1954)\n| ''\u2190 Milwaukee Brewers 1901 <br> \u2190 St. Louis Browns 1902-53 '' &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|bgcolor=\"lightyellow\"|'''Kansas City'''\n|style=\"background:#fbd; \"|[[Kansas City Athletics|Athletics]] (1955)\n| ''\u2190 Philadelphia 1871<br><small>[ \u2192 to Oakland 1968 ]</small>''\n|-\n| ''New York 1883'' \u2192\n| style=\"background:#acf\"|[[New York Giants (NL)|Giants]] (1958)\n| bgcolor=\"lightyellow\"|'''San Francisco'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|''Brooklyn 1883'' \u2192\n|style=\"background:#acf\"|[[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] (1958)\n|bgcolor=\"lightyellow\"|'''Los Angeles'''\n|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|}\n\nUntil the 1950s, major league baseball franchises had been largely confined to the northeastern United States, with the teams and their locations having remained unchanged from 1903 to 1952. The first team to relocate in fifty years was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], who moved in 1953 to Milwaukee, where the club set attendance records. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore and were renamed the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In 1955, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] moved to Kansas City.\n\n===National League Baseball leaves New York===\nIn 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were becoming the dominant draw, and the cities of the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave [[Walter O'Malley]], owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour of the city and asked him to pick his spot. The Giants were given the lease of the PCL [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] while [[Candlestick Park]] was built for them.\n\n===California===\n{{further|Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nThe logical first candidates for major league \"expansion\" were the same metropolitan areas that had just attracted the Dodgers and Giants. It is said{{by whom|date=September 2011}} that the Dodgers and Giants\u2014National League rivals in New York City\u2014chose their new cities because Los Angeles (in [[southern California]]) and San Francisco (in [[northern California]]) already had a fierce rivalry{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} (geographical, economic, cultural and political), dating back to the state's founding. The only California expansion team\u2014and also the first in Major League Baseball in over 70 years\u2014was the [[Los Angeles Angels]] (later the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels, and, as of 2005, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim), who brought the American League to southern California in 1961. Northern California, however, would later gain its own American League team, in 1968, when the [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]] would move again, settling in Oakland, across [[San Francisco Bay]] from the Giants.\n\n===1961\u20131962===\nAlong with the Angels, the other 1961 expansion team was the [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]], who joined the American League and took over the nation's capital when the [[Washington Senators (1901\u20131960)#Washington Nationals/Senators: 1901\u20131960|previous Senators]] moved to Minnesota and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]. 1961 is also noted as being the year in which [[Roger Maris]] surpassed Babe Ruth's single season home run record, hitting 61 for the New York Yankees, albeit in a slightly longer season than Ruth's. To keep pace with the American League\u2014which now had ten teams\u2014the National League likewise expanded to ten teams, in 1962, with the addition of the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and [[New York Mets]].\n\n[[Image:1985 Mother's Cookies - Oakland Coliseum.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum, opened in 1966, was built in part to lure the Athletics from Kansas City.]]\n\n===1969===\nIn 1969, the American League expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], the latter in a longtime PCL stronghold, were admitted to the league. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming today's [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The National League also added two teams that year, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the last of the core PCL teams to be absorbed. The Coast League did not die, though. After reforming and moving into new markets, it successfully transformed into a Class AAA league.\n\n===1972\u20132013===\nIn 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].\n\nIn 1977, the American League expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]].  Sixteen years later, in 1993, the National League likewise expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] (now Miami Marlins).\n\nBeginning with the 1994 season, both the AL and the NL were divided into three divisions (East, West, and Central), with the addition of a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) to enable four teams in each league to advance to the preliminary [[Division Series|division series]]. However, due to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike ]] (which canceled the [[1994 World Series]]), the new rules did not go into effect until the [[1995 World Series]].\n\nIn 1998, the AL and the NL each added a fifteenth team, for a total of thirty teams in [[Major League Baseball]]. The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] joined the National League, and the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]\u2014now called simply the Rays\u2014joined the American League. In order to keep the number of teams in each league at an even number (14 \u2013 AL, 16 \u2013 NL), Milwaukee changed leagues and became a member of the National League.<ref>''See'' [[Major League Baseball#League organization]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, in keeping with Commissioner [[Bud Selig]]'s desire for expanded interleague play, the [[Houston Astros]] were shifted from the National to the American League; with an odd number (15) in each league, an interleague contest was played somewhere almost every day during the season. At this time the divisions within each league were shuffled to create six equal divisions of five teams.\n\n==Pitching dominance and rules changes==\n[[Image:MLB runs.png|thumb|Graph showing, by year, the average number of runs per MLB game|250px]]\nBy the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968 [[Carl Yastrzemski]] won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in history. That same year, [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher [[Denny McLain]] won 31 games \u2013 making him the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season. [[St. Louis Cardinals]] starting pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.\n\nIn response to these events, major league baseball implemented certain rules changes in 1969 to benefit the batters. The pitcher's mound was lowered, and the [[strike zone]] was reduced.\n\nIn 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, made a move to increase scoring even further by initiating the [[designated hitter]] rule.\n\n==Players assert themselves==\n\n[[File:Sandy Koufax.jpg|thumb|180px|Hall of Famer [[Sandy Koufax]], who refused to re-sign his contract]]\nFrom the time of the formation of the Major Leagues to the 1960s, the team owners controlled the game. After the so-called \"Brotherhood Strike\" of 1890 and the failure of the [[Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players]] and its Players National League, the owners control of the game seemed absolute. It lasted over 70 years despite a number of short-lived players organizations. In 1966, however, the players enlisted the help of [[trade union|labor union]] activist [[Marvin Miller]] to form the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA). The same year, [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]] \u2013 both [[Cy Young Award]] winners for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] \u2013 refused to re-sign their contracts, and the era of the reserve clause, which held players to one team, was coming toward an end.\n\nThe first legal challenge came in 1970. Backed by the MLBPA, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] outfielder [[Curt Flood]] took the leagues to court to negate a player trade, citing the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] and [[antitrust]] legislation. In 1972 he finally lost his case in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] by a vote of 5 to 3, but gained large-scale public sympathy, and the damage had been done. The reserve clause survived, but it had been irrevocably weakened. In 1975 [[Andy Messersmith]] of the Dodgers and [[Dave McNally]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] played without contracts, and then declared themselves free agents in response to [[Seitz decision|an arbitrator's ruling]]. Handcuffed by concessions made in the Flood case, the owners had no choice but to accept the collective bargaining package offered by the MLBPA, and the reserve clause was effectively ended, to be replaced by the current system of free-agency and arbitration.\n\nWhile the legal challenges were going on, the game continued. In 1969 the [[1969 New York Mets season|\"Miracle Mets\"]], just 7 years after their formation, recorded their first winning season, won the National League East and finally the World Series.\n\nOn the field, the 1970s saw some of the longest standing records fall and the rise of two powerhouse dynasties. In Oakland, the [[Oakland Athletics|Swinging A's]] were overpowering, winning the Series in '72, '73 and '74, and five straight division titles. The strained relationships between teammates, who included [[Catfish Hunter]], [[Vida Blue]] and [[Reggie Jackson]], gave the lie to the need for \"chemistry\" between players. The National League, on the other hand, belonged to [[the Big Red Machine]] in Cincinnati, where [[Sparky Anderson]]'s team, which included [[Pete Rose]] as well as [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] Tony P\u00e9rez, [[Johnny Bench]] and [[Joe Morgan]], succeeded the A's run in 1975.\n\nThe decade also contained great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974, [[Hank Aaron]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] hit his 715th career home run, surpassing [[Babe Ruth]]'s all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755 and that was just one of numerous records he achieved, many of which, including [[Total bases]] scored, still stand today. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, [[Nolan Ryan]] threw 4 [[no-hitter|\"no-hit\" games]]. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 and two more before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,714 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.\n\n==The marketing and hype era==\nFrom the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like [[steroids]] tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.\n\n===The science of the sport changes the game===\nDuring the 1980s, the science of conditioning and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger than they had ever been.\n\nAnother major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the [[pitch count]]. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.\n\nAlong with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean.\n\n===Television===\nBaseball had been watched live since the mid 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s increased attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch [[Maury Wills]] rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, just as it did on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.\n\nThe national networks began televising national games of the week, opening the door for a national audience to see particular clubs. While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.\n\n===The rise of cable===\nIn the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], [[Ted Turner]]'s Atlanta-based Super-Station, that broadcast \"America's Team\" to cable households nationwide. The roll out of [[ESPN]], then regional sports networks (now mostly under the umbrella of [[Fox Sports Net]]) changed sports news and particularly impacted baseball. Boiled down to the thirty-second game highlight, and now under the microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels from where it had been just 20 years prior.\n\nIt brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached super-star status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time.\n\nAs player contract values soared, and the number of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative. Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits unless something extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines. When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.\n\nWith the development of [[satellite television]] and [[digital cable]], Major League Baseball launched baseball channels with season subscription fees, making it possible for fans to watch virtually every game played as they played.\n\n====Team networks====\nThe next round became the single-team cable networks. [[YES Network]] & [[New England Sports Network|NESN]], the New York Yankees & Boston Red Sox cable television networks, respectively, took in millions to broadcast games not only in New York and Boston but around the country. These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did. By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals.\n\n===Sponsorships, endorsements and merchandise===\nTelevision and greater media coverage in magazines and newspapers trying to attract a new generation of non-readers also brought in the sponsors, and even more money, that would attract players to new financial opportunities and bring in other elements to the business of baseball that would impact the game.\n\nBaseball memorabilia and souvenirs, including baseball cards, exploded in price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet again in the late 1990s, as the [[Internet]], and the website [[eBay]] provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means of making a living was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.\n\nBeyond the staple billboards, large corporations like NIKE and Champion fought to make sure that their logos were seen on the clothing and shoes worn by athletes on the field. This kind of association branding became a new revenue stream. In the late 1990s and into the dawn of the 21st century, the dugout, the backstops behind home plate, and anywhere else that might be seen by a camera all became fair game for inserting advertising.\n\n===Player wealth and influence===\nPlayers who had been dramatically underpaid for generations were now replaced by players who were paid extremely well for their services.\n* '''Sports agents'''\nBy the 1970s a new generation of [[sports agents]] were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played. The agents broke down what the teams were generating in revenue off of the players' performances. They calculated what their player might be worth to energize a television contract, or provide more merchandise revenue, or put more fans into seats.\n* '''Side deals'''\nThe athletes signed shoe deals, baseball card sponsorships, and commercial endorsements for products of every size and shape.\n* '''Business'''\n\nThe perception of players by the general public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a more cynical view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nWith players seeking greener pastures when their contracts came up, fewer players became career members of one ballclub. Large market clubs like the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the Chicago Cubs, given big revenues from their cable television operations, signed more and more of the big name players away from mid-sized and smaller market baseball clubs that could not afford to compete with them for salaries.\n\n===Owners and players feud in the 1980s===\nAll was not well with the game. The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in 1981. Previous players' strikes (in 1972, 1973 and 1980) had been held in preseason, with only the 1972 [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|stoppage]] \u2013 over benefits \u2013 causing disruption to the regular season from April 1 to April 13. Also, in 1976 the owners had locked the players out of [[Spring training]] in a dispute over [[free agent|free agency]].\n\nThe crux of the 1981 dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency. After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called ''sixteenth player'' (each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule). Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor, [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|striking]] on June 12. Immediately, the U.S. Government [[National Labor Relations Board]] ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost in the middle of the season, before the owners backed down on July 31, settling for much lower ranked players as compensation. By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting August 9, with the playoffs reorganized to reflect this.\n\nThroughout the 1980s then, baseball seemed to prosper. The competitive balance between franchises saw fifteen different teams make the [[World Series]], and nine different champions during the decade. Also, every season from 1978 through 1987 saw a different World Series winner, a streak unprecedented in baseball history. Turmoil was, however, just around the corner. In 1986 [[Pete Rose]] retired from playing for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], having broken [[Ty Cobb]]'s record by accumulating 4,256 hits during his career. He continued as Reds manager until, in 1989 it was revealed that he was being investigated for sports gambling, including the possibility that he had bet on teams with which he was involved. While Rose admitted a gambling problem, he denied having bet on baseball. Federal prosecutor John Dowd investigated and, on [[Dowd Report|his recommendation]], Rose was banned from organised baseball, a move which precluded his possible inclusion in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]]. In a meeting with Commissioner [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Giamatti]], Rose, having failed in a legal action to prevent it, accepted his punishment. It was, essentially, the same fate that had befallen the Black Sox seventy years previously. (Rose, however, would continue to deny that he bet on baseball until he finally confessed to it in his 2004 autobiography.)\n\n===1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike===\n{{Main|1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike}}\nLabor relations were still strained. There had been a two-day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a [[1990 Major League Baseball lockout|32-day spring training lockout]] in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits). By far the worst action would come in 1994. The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate salary and [[free agent|free-agency]] terms, but little progress was made. The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it. Adding to the problems was the perception that \"small market\" teams, such as the struggling [[Seattle Mariners]] could not compete with high spending teams such as those in [[New York Yankees|New York]] or [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]]. Their plan was to institute TV [[revenue sharing]] to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a [[salary cap]] to keep expenditures down. Players felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings.\n\nThe players officially went on strike on August 12, 1994. In September 1994 Major League Baseball announced the cancellation of the [[World Series]] for the first time since 1904.\n\n===Home run mania and the second coming of baseball===\n[[Image:Mark mcgwire.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Mark McGwire]] hits a home run during his last Major League season in 2001]]\nThe cancellation of the [[1994 World Series]] was a severe embarrassment for Major League Baseball.

This was the first high-profile moment in baseball after the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. Ripken continued his streak for another three years, voluntarily ending it at 2,632 [[Major League Baseball consecutive games played streaks|consecutive games played]] on September 20, 1998.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Florida Marlins]] won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] in just their fifth season. This made them the youngest expansion team to win the Fall Classic (with the exception of the 1903 [[Boston Red Sox]] and later the 2001 [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], who won in their fourth season). Virtually all the key players on the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|1997 Marlins]] team were soon traded or let go to save payroll costs (although the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|2003 Marlins]] did win a second [[2003 World Series|world championship]]).\n\nIn 1998, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[first baseman]] [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] [[outfielder]] [[Sammy Sosa]] engaged in a [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|home run race]] for the ages. With both rapidly approaching [[Roger Maris]]'s record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced to be the first to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent [[anabolic steroid|steroid]] allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.\n\nThat same year, the [[New York Yankees]] won a record 125 games, including going 11\u20132 in the postseason, to win the World Series as what many consider to be one of the greatest teams of all time.\n\nMcGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran [[San Francisco Giants]] [[left fielder]] [[Barry Bonds]] in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 [[List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders|home runs]], breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for [[base on balls]] with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by [[Babe Ruth]] in 1923) and [[slugging percentage]] with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by Ruth in 1920). Bonds continued his torrid home run hitting in the next few seasons, hitting his 660th career home run on April 12, 2004, tying him with his godfather [[Willie Mays]] for third place on the [[List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders|all-time career home runs]] list. He hit his 661st home run the next day, April 13, to take sole possession of third place. Only three years later Bonds surpassed the great Hank Aaron to become baseball's most prolific home run hitter.\n\nHowever, both Bonds' accomplishments in the 2000s have not been without controversy. During his run, journalists questioned McGwire about his use of the steroid-precursor [[androstenedione]], and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids. Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the [[BALCO]] drugs scandal, as his personal trainer [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.\n\nThe 1990s also saw Major League Baseball expand into new markets as four new teams joined the league. In 1993, the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] began play, and in just their fifth year of existence, the Marlins became the first wild card team to win the championship. {{Further|1997 World Series}}\n\nThe year 1998 brought two more teams into the mix, the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], the latter of which become the youngest expansion franchise to win the championship. {{Further|2001 World Series}}\n\nFor the most part, the late 1990s were dominated by the [[New York Yankees]], who won four out of five [[World Series]] championships from 1996\u20132000.\n\n==The steroid era==\n\n===Drugs, baseball, and records===\n{{see also|Doping in baseball}}\nThe lure of big money pushed players harder and harder to perform at their peaks. There is only so much conditioning that one can do to obtain an edge without inducing injury. The wearying travel schedule and 162-game season meant that [[amphetamine]]s, usually in the form of pep pills known as \"greenies\", had been widespread in baseball since at least the 1960s. Baseball's drug scene was no particular secret, having been discussed in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1969/0623.html |title=SI.com \u2013 Jun. 23, 1969 |publisher=Dynamic.si.cnn.com |date=June 23, 1969 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180011/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1969/0623.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df= }}</ref> and in [[Jim Bouton]]'s groundbreaking book ''[[Ball Four]]'', but there was virtually no public backlash.  Two decades later, however, some Major League players turned to newer [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[ephedra]] and improved [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|steroids]].\n\nA memo circulated in 1991 by baseball commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] said, \"The possession, sale or use of any illegal drug or controlled substance by Major League players and personnel is strictly prohibited ... [and those players involved] are subject to discipline by the Commissioner and risk permanent expulsion from the game.... This prohibition applies to all illegal drugs and controlled substances, including steroids\u2026\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/tom_verducci/04/05/week1.mailbag/1.html|author=Tom Verducci|title=Circus Act|date=April 5, 2006|accessdate=June 19, 2006|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Some general managers of the time do not remember this memo, and it was not emphasized or enforced.\n\nEphedra, a Chinese herb used to cure cold symptoms, and also used in some allergy medications, sped up the heart and was considered by some to be a weight-loss short-cut. Overweight pitcher [[Steve Bechler]], who wanted to stay on the Baltimore Orioles roster, took just such a shortcut. He collapsed on February 17, 2003 while pitching, and was soon pronounced dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguenews.com/features/articles2003/030703.html|title=Bechler Death Spotlights Ephedra|accessdate=July 19, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517203913/http://www.minorleaguenews.com/features/articles2003/030703.html|archivedate=May 17, 2006|df=}}</ref> Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Ephedra was banned, and soon the furor died down.\n\nThe 1998 home run race had generated nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' run for the all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's [[testosterone]] level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease. Some athletes have said that the main advantage to steroids is not so much the additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.\n\nCommissioner [[Bud Selig]] imposed a very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, who are not part of the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (the PA). Random drug testing, education and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.\n\nIn a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' cover story in 2002, a year after his retirement, [[Ken Caminiti]] admitted that he had used steroids during his National League MVP-winning 1996 season, and for several seasons afterwards. Caminiti died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in [[The Bronx]] at the age of 41; he was pronounced dead on October 10, 2004 at New York's [[Lincoln Hospital (Bronx, New York)|Lincoln Memorial Hospital]]. On November 1, the New York City Medical Examiners Office announced that Caminiti died from \"acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates\", but coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) were also contributing factors.\n\nIn 2005, [[Jose Canseco]] published ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big]]'', admitting steroid usage and claiming that it was prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the game's most prominent players came under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include [[Barry Bonds]], [[Jason Giambi]], and [[Mark McGwire]]. Other players, such as Canseco and [[Gary Sheffield]], have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the [[BALCO]] [[Grand Jury]] (that was later leaked to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''), Giambi also admitted steroid use. He later held a press conference in which he appeared to affirm this admission, without actually saying the words. And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, \"period\", slugger [[Rafael Palmeiro]] became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on August 1, 2005 for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on August 7, 2002, starting in the 2003 season. Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.\n\nIn 2006, the Commissioner of Baseball tasked former United States Senator George J. Mitchell to lead an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball (MLB) and on December 13, 2007, the 409-page [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]] was released ('Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball'). The report described the use of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) in MLB and assessed the effectiveness of the MLB Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Mitchell also advanced certain recommendations regarding the handling of past illegal drug use and future prevention practices. The report names 89 MLB players who are alleged to have used steroids or drugs.\n\nBaseball has been taken to task for turning a blind eye to its drug problems. It benefited from these drugs in the ever-increasingly competitive fight for airtime and media attention. MLB and its Players Association finally announced tougher measures, but many felt that they did not go far enough. {{Further|List of Major League Baseball players suspended for steroids}}\n\nIn December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Baseball's Steroid Scandal as the number one sports story of the decade of the 2000s.<ref>Jenkins, Lee [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/specials/2000s/12/12/top.stories/index.html \"2000s: Top 10 Stories\"] SI.com.

In addition, the company had connections to several San Francisco Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of [[Jason Giambi]] and [[Barry Bonds]]. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbcenter.com/steriods.php |title=Steroids in Baseball |author=Eric Gartman |accessdate=June 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409065531/http://www.mlbcenter.com/steriods.php |archivedate=April 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Among the many athletes who have been linked to BALCO are Olympic sprinters [[Tim Montgomery]] and [[Marion Jones]], Olympic shot-putter [[C. J.

The reports that came from the San Francisco Chronicle were done by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, who revealed that the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative did not merely manufacture nutritional supplements, but also distributed exotic steroids. Williams and Fairanu-Wada also provided compelling evidence that Bonds, arguably the greatest player of his generation, was one of BALCO's steroid clients.<ref>http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=erik_ugland</ref> The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements. Based on the testimony from many of the athletes, Conte and Anderson accepted plea agreements from the government in 2005 on charges they distributed steroids and laundered money to avoid significant time in jail. Conte received a sentence of four months in jail, Anderson received a sentence of three months. Also that year, James Valente, the vice president of Balco, and Remi Korchemny, a track coach affiliated with BALCO, pleaded guilty to distributing banned substances and received probation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/bay_area_laboratory_cooperative/index.html |title=Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nVarious baseball pundits, fans, and even players have taken this as confirmation that Bonds used illegal steroids. Bonds never tested positive in tests performed in 2003, 2004, and 2005, which may be attributable to successful obfuscation of continued use as documented in the 2006 book ''[[Game of Shadows]]''.\n\n===The Power Age===\n[[Image:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|right|To meet the Power Age, [[Citi Field]] was built in New York to favor teams built on pitching, defense, and speed.]]\nWhile the introduction of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994. The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, the [[juiced ball theory|\"juiced balls\" theory]] claiming that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, \"watered down pitching\" implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams. Albeit that these factors did play a large role in increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit \"mistake\" pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to \"good\" pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.\n\nRoutinely in today's baseball age we see players reach 40 and 50 home runs in a season, a feat that even in the 1980s was considered rare. On the other hand, since the end of the steroid era, the emphasis on swinging for home runs has been accompanied by hitting in general falling off, with batting averages trending downwards towards 1960s levels and strikeouts reaching all-time highs: ''each'' of the eleven seasons 2006-2016 broke the preceding MLB-total record for strikeouts.\n\nMany modern baseball theorists believe that a new pitch will swing the balance of power back to the pitcher. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented\u2014several pitches have changed the game of baseball in the past, including the [[slider]] in the 1950s and 1960s and the [[fastball|split-fingered fastball]] in the 1970s to 1990s. Since the 1990s, the [[changeup]] has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as [[Tim Lincecum]], [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]], [[Trevor Hoffman]], [[Greg Maddux]], [[Matt Cain]], [[Tom Glavine]], [[Johan Santana]], [[Marco Estrada (baseball)|Marco Estrada]], [[Justin Verlander]] and [[Cole Hamels]].\n\n== Summary of modern-era major league teams ==\n*1876 \u2013 National League is established\n*1900 \u2013 National League \"classic eight\" lineup of teams is established: Chicago Cubs, Boston Braves, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and St. Louis Cardinals\n*1901 \u2013 American League is established with eight teams: Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Athletics, Washington Senators, Milwaukee Brewers, and Baltimore Orioles\n*1902 \u2013 Milwaukee Brewers move to St. Louis and become the Browns\n*1903 \u2013 Baltimore Orioles move to New York and become the Yankees\n*1953 \u2013 Boston Braves move to Milwaukee\n*1954 \u2013 St. Louis Browns move to Baltimore and become the Orioles\n*1955 \u2013 Philadelphia Athletics move to Kansas City\n*1958 \u2013 New York Giants move to San Francisco; Brooklyn Dodgers move to Los Angeles\n*1961 \u2013 Washington Senators move to Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul and become the Minnesota Twins; new Washington Senators (AL) and Los Angeles Angels (AL) created as expansion teams\n*1962 \u2013 Houston Astros (NL) and New York Mets (NL) created as expansion teams\n*1966 \u2013 Milwaukee Braves move to Atlanta\n*1968 \u2013 Kansas City Athletics move to Oakland\n*1969 \u2013 San Diego Padres (NL), Montreal Expos (NL), Kansas City Royals (AL), and Seattle Pilots (AL) created as expansion teams\n*1970 \u2013 Seattle Pilots move to Milwaukee and become the Brewers\n*1972 \u2013 Washington Senators move to Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and become the Texas Rangers\n*1977 \u2013 Seattle Mariners (AL) and Toronto Blue Jays (AL) created as expansion teams\n*1993 \u2013 Colorado Rockies (NL) and Miami Marlins (NL) created as expansion teams\n*1998 \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks (NL) and Tampa Bay Rays (AL) created as expansion teams; Milwaukee Brewers switch from AL to NL\n*2005 \u2013 Montreal Expos move to Washington and become the Nationals\n*2013 \u2013 Houston Astros switch from NL to AL\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n* [[Timeline of Major League Baseball]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.old-picture.com/baseball-index-001.htm|title=Baseball Pictures from 1900 to 1940}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Charles C. |title=Breaking the Slump: Baseball in the Depression Era |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-231-11342-0 }}\n* {{cite book|last=Bouton|first=Jim|title=Ball Four: My Life and Hard Times Throwing the Knuckleball in the Major Leagues|publisher=World Publishing Company|year=1970|isbn=0-02-030665-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|title=The Historical Baseball Abstract|location=New York|publisher=Villard|year=1985}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lamoreaux |first=David |year=1977 |title=Baseball in the Late Nineteenth Century: The Source of its Appeal |journal=Journal of Popular Culture |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=597\u2013613 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1977.00597.x }}\n* {{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Cait|year=2007|title=Crazy '08: How a Cast of Cranks, Rogues, Boneheads, and Magnates Created the Greatest Year in Baseball History|location=New York|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-0-06-088937-1}}\n* Pepe, Phil.

One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the [[National League|National]] and [[American League]]. Originally, the award was known as the [[J. Louis Comiskey]] Memorial Award, named after the [[Chicago White Sox]] owner of the 1930s.

('''NLCS''') is a [[Playoff format#Best-of-fiveplayoff|best-of-seven series]] played in October in the [[Major League Baseball postseason]] that determines the winner of the [[National League]] (NL) pennant. The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) in the [[World Series]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s championship series.\n\n==History==\n\nPrior to 1969, the National League champion (the \"[[List of National League pennant winners|pennant winner]]\") was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four ''ad hoc'' [[List of Major League Baseball tie-breakers|three-game playoff series]] due to ties under this formulation (in 1946, 1951, 1959, and 1962). (The [[American League]] had to resolve a tie in 1948, but used a single-game playoff.)\n\nA structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.\n\nThe NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to seven games, are always played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format: games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that made the postseason as the [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|Wild Card]] cannot get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was predetermined before the season.\n\nIn 1981, a [[1981 National League Division Series|divisional series]] was held due to a split season caused by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]].\n\nIn 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the [[National League Division Series]] (NLDS). The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS.\n\nThe [[Milwaukee Brewers]], an American League team between 1969 and 1997, and the [[Houston Astros]], a National League team between 1962 and 2012, are the only franchises to play in both the ALCS and NLCS. The Astros are the only team to have won both an NLCS ([[2005 National League Championship Series|2005]]) and an ALCS ([[2017 American League Championship Series|2017]]). The Astros made four NLCS appearances before moving to the AL in 2013. Every current National League franchise has appeared in the NLCS.<ref>Note: The [[Washington Nationals]] having done so in 1981, as the [[Montreal Expos]]</ref>\n\n==Championship Trophy==\nThe [[Warren C. Giles Trophy]], named for the [[Warren Giles|president of the NL]] from 1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20081016__Fantastic_feeling__for_Bill_Giles.html|title='Fantastic feeling' for Bill Giles,|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=Oct 16, 2008|accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Most Valuable Player Award==\n:''See: [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award#National League winners]]''\nA Most Valuable Player ([[MVP]]) award is given to the outstanding player in each series, though voters can consider performances made during the divisional series.  The MVP award has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco Giants.\n\nAlthough the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award until 1980.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_lcs.jsp?feature=mvp League Championship Series Most Valuable Players] (MLB.com/News/Awards/History/ ).

The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League Championship Series|Championship Series]] (NLCS) in the [[World Series]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s championship series.\n\n==History==\nPrior to 1969, the American League champion (the \"[[List of American League pennant winners|pennant winner]]\") was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There was one ''ad hoc'' [[List of Major League Baseball tie-breakers|single-game playoff]] held, in {{mlby|1948}}, due to a tie under this formulation. (The [[National League]] had to resolve ties four times, but used three-game playoff series.)\n\nThe ALCS started in 1969, when the AL reorganized into two divisions, [[American League East|East]] and [[American League West|West]]. The winners of each division played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven. \n\nIn 1981, a [[1981 National League Division Series|division series]] was held due to a split season caused by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. \n\nIn 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, known as the [[American League Division Series]] (ALDS). The winners of that round then advanced to the best-of-seven ALCS. In 2012, the [[playoff]]s  were expanded again so that two wild card teams face off in a one-game wild card round to determine which team advances to the division series, with the playoffs then continuing as it had before 2012 (though with the possibility of a fifth seed being in the playoffs and a fourth seed being out) after the end of the wild card round. This is the system currently in use.\n\nThe ALCS and NLCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has [[home field advantage]], and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. The series concludes when one team records its fourth win. Since 1998, home field advantage has been given to the team that has the better regular season record, unless that team happens to be the Wild Card team. In that case, the other team gets home field advantage, because by rule the Wild Card team is never allowed home field advantage in a Division Series or LCS. In the event that both teams have identical records in the regular season, home field advantage goes to the team that has the winning head-to-head record. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage alternated between the two divisions, and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was determined before the season.\n\nThe [[Milwaukee Brewers]], an American League team between 1969 and 1997, and the [[Houston Astros]], a National League team between 1962 and 2012, are the only franchises to play in both the ALCS and NLCS. The Astros are the only team to have won both an NLCS ([[2005 National League Championship Series|2005]]) and an ALCS ([[2017 American League Championship Series|2017]]). Every current American League franchise has appeared in the ALCS.\n\n==Championship Trophy==\nThe [[List of Major League Baseball awards#William Harridge Trophy|William Harridge Trophy]] is awarded to the ALCS champion. The trophy's namesake comes from the [[Will Harridge|American League president]] from 1931 to 1959.<ref>winner.http://fielderschoice.wordpress.com/2009/04/10/overjoyed/ Dave (Tampa Bay Rays fan), \"Overjoyed!\", Fielder's Choice Baseball Card Blog, April 10, 2009.

The Division Series consists of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and the winner of the [[Wild card (sports)|wild-card]] play-off.\n\n==History==\nThe Division Series was implemented in 1981 as a one-off tournament because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]], with the first place teams before the strike taking on the teams in first place after the strike. In 1994, it was returned permanently when [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) restructured each league into three divisions, but with a different format than in 1981. In 1981, a split-season format forced the first ever divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] (who were in the American League until 1998) in five games while in the Western Division, the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] swept the [[1981 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] (the only team with an overall losing record to ever make the postseason). Including the 2018 postseason, the Yankees have played in the most division series, with twenty appearances. In 2015, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Houston Astros]] were the final American League teams to make their first appearances in the ALDS. The Astros had been in the National League through 2012, and had played in the [[National League Division Series]] (NLDS) seven times.\n\n===Determining the matchups===\nFrom 1998 to 2011, the [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team was assigned to play the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners met in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders played each other.\n\nBeginning with the 2012 season, the wild card team that advances to the Division Series was to face the number 1 seed, regardless of whether or not they are in the same division. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven ALCS. Home field advantage goes to the team with the better regular season record (or head-to-head record if there is a tie between two or more teams), except for the wild card team, which never receives the home field advantage.\n\nBeginning in 2003, MLB has implemented a new rule to give the team from the league that wins the All-Star Game with the best regular season record a slightly greater advantage. In order to spread out the Division Series games for broadcast purposes, the two ALDS series follow one of two off-day schedules. Starting in 2007, after consulting the [[MLBPA]], MLB has decided to allow the team with the best record in the league that wins the All-Star Game to choose whether to use the seven-day schedule (1-2-off-3-4-off-5) or the eight-day schedule (1-off-2-off-3-4-off-5).

When MLB added a second wild card team in 2012, the Division Series re-adopted the 2-3 format due to scheduling conflicts.

The Division Series consists of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and the winner of the [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] play-off.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Division Series}}\nThe Division Series was implemented in 1981 \u2013 for that season only \u2013 as a result of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]] with first-place teams before the strike taking on the first-place teams after. In 1994, Major League Baseball decided to implement the Division Series permanently, because it was restructuring each league into three divisions. (The new division series had a somewhat diferent format than the one-off 1981 tournament. Additionally, the implementation of this decision, however, was delayed a year, until 1995, due to the [[1994-95 Major League Baseball strike|1994\u20131995 players' strike]].<ref>See: {{section link|Division Series|1993-1994: Proposal, realignment, and cancellation of 1994 postseason}}.</ref>) Previously, because of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] in [[1981 in baseball|1981]], a split-season format forced a divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] three games to two while the [[1981 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] beat the [[1981 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] three games to two in the Western Division. The team with the best overall record in the major leagues, the [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], failed to win their division in either half of that season and were controversially excluded, as were the [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who finished with the NL's second-best record. The [[Atlanta Braves]] have currently played in the most NL division series with thirteen appearances. The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] have currently won the most NL division series, winning ten of the thirteen series in which they have played. The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (who finished with a losing record from 1993 to 2012) were the last team to make their first appearance in the NL division series, making their debut in 2013 after winning the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game]]. In [[2008 in baseball|2008]], the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] became the first team to play in division series in both leagues when they won the National League wild card, their first postseason berth since winning the [[American League East Division]] title in [[1982 in baseball|1982]] before switching leagues in [[1998 in baseball|1998]]. Milwaukee had competed in an [[1981 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] in the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1981 in baseball|1981 season]].\n\n===Format===\nThe NLDS is a five-game series where the wild-card team is assigned to play the divisional winner with the best winning percentage in the regular season. The two remaining divisional winners meet in the other (NLDS) series with the team with the second best winning percentage, hosting that series. (From 1998 to 2011, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders played each other.) The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven NLCS. The winner of the wild card has won the first round seven out of the 11 years since the re-alignment and creation of the NLDS.{{Update inline|reason=This statement evidently added in 2005 and never updated. The re-alignment took place in 1994.|date=October 2015}} According to [[Nate Silver]], the advent of this playoff series, and especially of the wild card, has caused teams to focus more on \"getting to the playoffs\" rather than \"winning the pennant\" as the primary goal of the regular season.<ref>[[Nate Silver]], \"Selig's Dream: The Wild Card as Enabler of Pennant Races,\" in Steven Goldman, Ed., ''It Ain't Over 'til It's Over'' (New York: Basic Books): 170-178.</ref>\n\nInitially, the best-of-5 series played in a 2-3 format, with the first two games set at home for the lower-seed team and the last three for the higher seed.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1984_NLCS.shtml 1984 NL Championship Series], Baseball-Reference.com</ref><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1997_ALDS1.shtml 1997 AL Division Series], Baseball-Reference.com</ref> Since 1998, the series has followed a 2-2-1 format,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Gillette | editor-first = Gary | editor2-last = Palmer | editor2-first = Pete | encyclopedia = The 2006 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia | title = October Classics: Postseason Series and Playoffs | page = 1656 | publisher = Sterling Publishing | year = 2006 | location = New York}}</ref> where the higher seed team plays at home in Games 1 and 2, the lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary), and if a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field. When MLB added a second wild card team in 2012, the Division Series re-adopted the 2-3 format due to scheduling conflicts. It reverted to the 2-2-1 format from 2013 onwards.<ref name=\"SportingNews-2012WildCard\">{{cite web\n | author = Sporting News\n | title = MLB expands playoff field to 10 teams with addition of two

Diamondbacks pitchers [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]] were both named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Player]]s.\n\nThe Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[Oakland Athletics]], three games to two, in the [[2001 American League Division Series|AL Division Series]], and then the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2001 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the Yankees' fourth consecutive World Series appearance, after winning championships in {{wsy|1998}}, {{wsy|1999}}, and {{wsy|2000}}. The Diamondbacks advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], three games to two, in the [[2001 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]], and then the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the franchise's first appearance in a World Series.\n\nThe Series began later than usual as a result of a delay in the regular season after the [[September 11 attacks]] and was the first to extend into November. The Diamondbacks won the first two games at home, limiting the Yankees to just one run. The Yankees responded with a close win in game 3, at which US President [[George W. Bush]] threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]]. In games 4 and 5, the Yankees won in comeback fashion, hitting game-tying [[home run]]s off Diamondbacks [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Byung-hyun Kim]] with one out remaining in consecutive games, before winning in extra innings. The Diamondbacks won game 6 in blowout, forcing a decisive game 7. In the final game, the Yankees led in the ninth inning before the Diamondbacks staged a comeback against closer [[Mariano Rivera]], capped off by a [[Glossary of baseball (W)#walk-off home run|walk-off]], bases-loaded bloop single by [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] to clinch Arizona's championship victory. This was the third World Series to end in a bases-loaded, walk-off hit, following {{wsy|1991}} and {{wsy|1997}}. \n\nAmong several firsts, the 2001 World Series was: the first World Series championship for the Diamondbacks; the first World Series ever played in the state of Arizona and the Mountain Time Zone; the first championship for a [[Western United States|Far West state]] other than California; the first major professional sports team from the state of Arizona to win a championship; and the earliest an MLB franchise had ever won a World Series (the Diamondbacks had only existed for four years). The home team won every game in the Series, which had only happened twice before, in [[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1991 World Series|1991]]. The Diamondbacks outscored the Yankees, 37\u201314, as a result of large margins of victory achieved by Arizona at [[Bank One Ballpark]] relative to the one-run margins the Yankees achieved at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Arizona's pitching held powerhouse New York to a .183 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], the lowest in a seven-game World Series.

(a winning percentage of {{winpct|95|65}}), 13 1/2 games ahead of the [[2001 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].  The Yankees then defeated the [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] 3 games to 2 in the [[2001 American League Division Series|AL Division Series]], and the [[2001 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 4 games to 1 in the [[2001 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]] to advance to their fourth consecutive World Series, and fifth in six years.\n\n[[Derek Jeter]] and [[Tino Martinez]] led the Yankees offensively during the 2001 season.  Jeter batted .311 with 21 home runs and 74 RBI in 150 games, while Martinez batted .280 with 34 home runs and 113 RBI in 154 games.  [[Roger Clemens]] and [[Mike Mussina]] were the leaders of the Yankees' pitching staff.  Clemens finished with a win-loss record of 20\u20133, an [[earned-run average]] (ERA) of 3.51, and struck out 213 batters in 220.1 innings pitched.

The last three games were the first major-league games (other than exhibitions) played in the month of November. This was just the fourth time that no World Series champion was decided within the traditional month of October. The previous three occurrences were in {{wsy|1904}} (no series), {{wsy|1918}} (series held in September because of World War I), and {{wsy|1994}} (series cancelled by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]). Additionally, the Series took place in New York City only seven weeks after the attacks, representing a remarkable boost in morale for the fatigued city. Along with this President George W.

After [[Mark Grace]] was intentionally walked, [[Damian Miller]]'s RBI double gave Arizona a 5-1 lead.\n\nNext inning, Gonzalez hit a two-out double off of [[Randy Choate]]. [[Reggie Sanders]] was intentionally walked before Gonzalez scored on [[Steve Finley]]'s single. An error by third baseman Brosius scored Sanders, put Finley at third, and Williams at second. Both men scored on [[Mark Grace]]'s double, putting Arizona up 9-1. Though the Diamondbacks got just one more hit for the rest of the game off of [[Sterling Hitchcock]] and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] (Williams's leadoff single in the seventh), they went up 1-0 in the series.\n\n===Game 2===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Sunday, October 28, 2001\n|Time=5:59{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=3|RE=0\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=ARI\n|H1=0|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=3|H8=0|H9=X|HR=4|HH=5|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Andy Pettitte]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] (1)\n|}}\n\nArizona continued to take control of the Series with the strong pitching performance of [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]]. The Big Unit pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only four baserunners and three hits while striking out eleven Yankees. [[Andy Pettitte]] meanwhile nearly matched him, retiring Arizona in order in five of the seven innings he pitched. In the second, he allowed a leadoff single to [[Reggie Sanders]], who scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s double. Bautista was the only Arizona runner stranded for the entire game. In the seventh, Pettitte hit [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] with a pitch before Sanders grounded into a forceout. After Bautista singled, [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s three-run home run put Arizona up 4-0. They won the game with that score and led the series two games to none as it moved to New York City.\n\n===Game 3===\n[[File:2001 World Series first pitch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Donning an [[FDNY]] fleece, with a bulletproof vest underneath, President Bush tosses out the ceremonial first pitch.]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Tuesday, October 30, 2001\n|Time=8:30{{nbsp}}pm ([[Eastern Time Zone|EST]])\n|Location=[[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[The Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|Road=Arizona|RoadAbr=ARI\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=1|RH=3|RE=3\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=2|HH=7|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Roger Clemens]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Brian Anderson (pitcher)|Brian Anderson]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Mariano Rivera]] (1)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Jorge Posada]] (1)\n|}}\n\nThe game was opened in New York by President [[George W. Bush]], who threw the [[ceremonial first pitch]], a strike to Yankees backup catcher [[Todd Greene]]. Bush became the first [[incumbent]] U.S. president to throw a World Series first pitch since [[Jimmy Carter]] in {{wsy|1979}}. He also threw the baseball from the mound where the pitcher would be set (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ''\"[[U-S-A! cheer|U-S-A]], U-S-A\"'' rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter [[Roger Clemens]] allowed only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work. Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] pitched two innings for the save.\n\n[[Jorge Posada]]'s leadoff home run off of [[Brian Anderson (pitcher)|Brian Anderson]] in the second put the Yankees up 1-0. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the fourth on two walks and one hit before [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s sacrifice fly tied the game. [[Bernie Williams]] hit a leadoff single in the sixth and moved to second on a wild pitch one out later before Posada walked. [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] relieved Anderson and struck out [[David Justice]] before [[Scott Brosius]] broke the tie with an RBI single. The Yankees cut Arizona's series lead to 2-1 with the win.\n\n===Game 4===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Wednesday, October 31, 2001\n|Time=8:23{{nbsp}}pm (EST)\n|Location=Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York\n|Road=Arizona|RoadAbr=ARI\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=2|R9=0|R10=0|RR=3|RH=6|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=1|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=2|H10=1|HR=4|HH=7|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Mariano Rivera]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Byung-hyun Kim]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Mark Grace]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Shane Spencer]] (1), [[Tino Martinez]] (1), [[Derek Jeter]] (1)\n|}}\n\nGame 4 saw the Yankees send [[Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]] to the mound while the Diamondbacks elected to bring back [[Curt Schilling]] on three days' rest. Both pitchers gave up home runs, with Schilling doing so to [[Shane Spencer]] in the third inning and Hernandez doing so to [[Mark Grace]] in the fourth. Hernandez pitched {{frac|6|1|3}} solid innings, giving up four hits while Schilling went seven innings and gave up three.\n\nWith the game still tied entering the eighth, Arizona struck. After [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] recorded the first out of the inning, [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] singled and [[Erubiel Durazo]] hit a double to bring him in. [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] followed by grounding into a fielder's choice off of [[Ramiro Mendoza]], which scored pinch runner [[Midre Cummings]] and gave the team a 3-1 lead.\n\nWith his team on the verge of taking a commanding 3-1 series lead, Diamondbacks manager [[Bob Brenly]] elected to bring in closer [[Byung-hyun Kim]] in the bottom of the eighth for a two-inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player ever to play in the MLB World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but ran into trouble in the ninth.\n\n[[Derek Jeter]] led off by trying to bunt for a hit but was thrown out by Williams. [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] then lined a single in front of Gonzalez. After [[Bernie Williams (born 1968)|Bernie Williams]] struck out, Kim seemed to be out of trouble with [[Tino Martinez]] coming to the plate. However, Martinez drove the first pitch he saw from Kim into the right-center field bleachers, tying the score at 3-3. The Yankees were not done, as [[Jorge Posada]] walked and [[David Justice]] moved him into scoring position with a single. Kim struck Spencer out to end the threat.\n\nWhen the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard \"Welcome to November Baseball\".\n\n[[Mariano Rivera]] took the hill for the Yankees in the tenth and retired the Diamondbacks in order. Kim went out for a third inning of work and retired [[Scott Brosius]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]], but Jeter hit an opposite field home run on a 3\u20132 pitch count from Kim. This home run gave the Yankees a 4\u20133 victory and tied the Series at two games apiece, making Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \"Mr. November\".\n\n===Game 5===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Thursday, November 1, 2001\n|Time=8:23{{nbsp}}pm (EST)\n|Location=Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York\n|Road=Arizona|RoadAbr=ARI\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=2|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|R10=0|R11=0|R12=0|RR=2|RH=8|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=2|H10=0|H11=0|H12=1|HR=3|HH=9|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Sterling Hitchcock]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Albie Lopez]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Steve Finley]] (1), [[Rod Barajas]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Scott Brosius]] (1)\n|}}\n\nGame 5 saw the Yankees return to [[Mike Mussina]] for the start while the Diamondbacks sent [[Miguel Batista]], who had not pitched in twelve days, to the mound. Batista pitched a strong {{frac|7|2|3}} scoreless innings, striking out six. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, recording ten strikeouts, but allowed home runs to [[Steve Finley]] and [[Rod Barajas]] in the fifth.\n\nWith the Diamondbacks leading 2\u20130 in the ninth, [[Byung-hyun Kim]] was called upon for the save despite having thrown three innings the night before. [[Jorge Posada]] doubled to open the inning, but Kim got [[Shane Spencer]] to ground out and then struck out [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. As had happened the previous night, Kim could not hold the lead as [[Scott Brosius]] hit a 1\u20130 pitch over the left field wall, the second straight game tying home run in the bottom of the ninth for the Yankees. Kim was pulled from the game in favor of [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] who recorded the final out.\n\nMorgan retired the Yankees in order in the tenth and eleventh innings, while the Diamondbacks got to [[Mariano Rivera]] in the eleventh. [[Danny Bautista]] and [[Erubiel Durazo]] opened the inning with hits and [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] advanced them into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt. Rivera then intentionally walked [[Steve Finley]] to load the bases, then got [[Reggie Sanders]] to line out and [[Mark Grace]] grounded out to end the inning.\n\nArizona went to [[Albie Lopez]] in the twelfth, and in his first at bat he gave up a single to Knoblauch. Brosius moved him over with a bunt, and then [[Alfonso Soriano]] ended the game with an RBI single to give the Yankees a 3-2 victory and a 3-2 lead in the series.\n\n===Game 6===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Saturday, November 3, 2001\n|Time=5:53{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=7|RE=1\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=ARI\n|H1=1|H2=3|H3=8|H4=3|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=15|HH=22|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (2\u20130)|LP=[[Andy Pettitte]] (0\u20132)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nWith Arizona in a must-win situation, [[Randy Johnson]] pitched seven innings and struck out seven, giving up just two runs. The Diamondbacks struck first when [[Tony Womack]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Andy Pettitte]] and scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s single in the first. Next inning, Womack's bases-loaded single scored two and Bautista's single scored another. The Yankees loaded the bases in the third on a single and two walks, but Johnson struck out [[Jorge Posada]] to end the inning. The Diamondbacks broke the game open with eight runs in the bottom half. Pettitte allowed a leadoff walk to [[Greg Colbrunn]] and subsequent double to [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] before being relieved by [[Jay Witasick]], who allowed four straight singles to [[Reggie Sanders]], [[Jay Bell]], [[Damian Miller]], and Johnson that scored three runs. After Womack struck out, Bautista's single scored two more runs and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]'s double scored another, with Bautista being thrown out at home. Colbrunn's single and Williams's double scored a run each before Sanders struck out to end the inning. In the fourth, Bell reached first on a strike-three wild pitch before scoring on Miller's double. Johnson struck out before Womack singled to knock Witasick out of the game. With [[Randy Choate]] pitching, Yankees second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]]'s error on Bautista's ground ball allowed Miller to score and put runners on first and second before Gonzalez's single scored the Diamondbacks' final run. Choate and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. Pettitte was charged with six runs in two innings while Witasick was charged with nine runs in 1 1/3 innings. The Yankees scored their only runs in the sixth on back-to-back one-out singles by [[Shane Spencer]] and [[Luis Sojo]] with runners on second and third. The Diamondbacks hit six doubles and Danny Bautista batted 3-for-4 with five RBIs. The team set a World Series record with 22 hits and defeated the New York Yankees in its most lopsided postseason loss in 293 postseason games, since surpassed by a 16-1 loss to the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 2018.<ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/alds-game-3-red-sox-hand-yankees-worst-postseason-loss-team-history-032442415.html</ref> The 15\u20132 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.\n\n===Game 7===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Sunday, November 4, 2001\n|Time=5:55{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=1|R8=1|R9=0|RR=2|RH=6|RE=3\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=ARI\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=2|HR=3|HH=11|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (3\u20130)|LP=[[Mariano Rivera]] (1\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Alfonso Soriano]] (1)|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nIt was a matchup of two twenty-game winners in the Series finale that would crown a new champion. [[Roger Clemens]], at 39 years old, became the oldest Game 7 starter ever. [[Curt Schilling]] had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full innings, the game was tied at 1\u20131. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a [[Steve Finley]] single and a [[Danny Bautista]] double (Bautista would be called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from [[Tino Martinez]], which drove in [[Derek Jeter]]. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit a home run on an 0\u20132 pitch. After Schilling struck out [[Scott Brosius]], he gave up a single to [[David Justice]], and he left the game trailing 2\u20131. Brenly brought in [[Miguel Batista]] to get Jeter out and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter [[Randy Johnson]], who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired pinch hitter [[Chuck Knoblauch]] (who batted for the left handed [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]]) on a fly out to Bautista in right field, then Johnson returned to the mound for the top of the ninth where he got [[Bernie Williams]] to fly out to [[Steve Finley]] in center field, Martinez to ground out to [[Tony Womack]] at shortstop and he then struck out catcher [[Jorge Posada]] to send the game to the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nWith the Yankees ahead 2\u20131 in the bottom of the eighth, manager [[Joe Torre]] turned the game over to his ace closer [[Mariano Rivera]] for a two-inning save. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]], and Bautista, lowering his postseason ERA to a Major League-best 0.70.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/Playoffs_pitching.shtml|title=All-time and Single-Season Postseason Pitching Leaders {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-01}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Although he was effective in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.\n\n[[Mark Grace]] led off the inning with a single to center on a 1\u20130 pitch. Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by [[Damian Miller]] on an 0\u20131 pitch put runners on first and second. Jeter tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner [[David Dellucci]], who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. During the next at bat, Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded [[Jay Bell]]'s bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman Brosius decided to hold onto the baseball instead of throwing to first to complete the [[double play]]. [[Midre Cummings]] was sent in to pinch-run for [[Damian Miller]]. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, Womack, hit a double down the right-field line on a 2\u20132 pitch that tied the game and earned Rivera a blown save. Bell advanced to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and outfield in as the potential winning run stood at third with fewer than two outs. After Rivera hit [[Craig Counsell]] with an 0\u20131 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0\u20131 pitch, Gonzalez lofted a soft single over the drawn-in Jeter that barely reached the outfield grass, plating [[Jay Bell]] with the winning run. This ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship in its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series. It was also the first, and remains the only, major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona.\n\nIn 2009, Game 7 of the 2001 World Series was chosen by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as the [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors#Major League Baseball|Best Postseason Game of the Decade]] (2000\u20132009).\n\n==Composite box==\n2001 World Series '''(4\u20133): [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] (N.L.)''' over [[New York Yankees]] (A.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[Arizona Diamondbacks]]'''\n|R1=2|R2=4|R3=12|R4=9|R5=2|R6=1|R7=3|R8=2|R9=2|R10=0|R11=0|R12=0|RR=37|RH=65|RE=3\n|Home='''[[New York Yankees]]'''\n|H1=1|H2=1|H3=1|H4=0|H5=0|H6=3|H7=1|H8=1|H9=4|H10=1|H11=0|H12=1|HR=14|HH=42|HE=8\n|TotalAttendance=366,289 |AveAttendance=52,327\n|WinPlayerShare=$279,260 |LosePlayerShare=$201,014<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archivedate= May 2, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Media coverage==\nFor the second consecutive year, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (himself a [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]]). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held ever since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s purchase of [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of postseason games on ABC Family, Fox Family's successor). [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] calling the action.\n\nLocally, the Series was broadcast by [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR-AM]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] with [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Greg Schulte]], [[Rod Allen]] and [[Jim Traber]], and by [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]] in New York City with [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] and [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]]. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new [[YES Network]] the following season and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] picked up radio rights to the Yankees. It was Kay who announced [[Derek Jeter]]'s game-winning home run in Game 4 of the series and subsequently anointed him as \"Mr. November\".\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the Yankees lost the World Series, several players moved onto other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the signing of [[Jason Giambi]] to replace Martinez and the retirements of Brosius and O'Neill. Martinez would later finish his career with the Yankees in 2005 after spending the previous three years in St. Louis and Tampa Bay.\n\nAfter winning the NL West again in 2002 the [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] were swept 3\u20130 by [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in the [[2002 National League Division Series|NLDS]]. From here they declined, losing 111 games in 2004 as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. Arizona would not win another NL West title until 2007. Schilling was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the 2003 season and in 2004 helped lead them to their first world championship since 1918. He helped them win another championship in 2007 and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|throw a perfect game]] against the [[2004 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the [[San Francisco Giants]] in 2009. The last player from the 2001 Diamondbacks roster, [[Lyle Overbay]], retired following the 2014 season with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] while the last player from the 2001 Yankees, [[Randy Choate]], retired on February 16, 2017.<ref>http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/16/sweeny-randy-choate-retirement/</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 through 2007, the Yankees' misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in 2002, the [[2003 World Series|World Series]] to the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in 2003, the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] (in the process becoming the first ever team in postseason history to blow a 3-0 series lead) in 2004, the [[2005 American League Division Series|ALDS]] again to the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in 2005, the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit]] in 2006, and the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] in 2007. [[Joe Torre]]'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by [[Joe Girardi]] in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The Yankees won their 27th World Series championship in 2009, defeating the defending champion [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.\n\n[[Buster Olney]], who covered the Yankees for ''[[The New York Times]]'' before joining ESPN, would write a book titled ''[[The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty]]''. The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996\u20132001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epilogue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3\u20130 in the 2004 ALCS.\n\n{{as of|2018}}, this is the state of [[Arizona]]'s only world championship among the [[major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|four major professional sports]].\n\n==DVD==\nOn October 11, 2005, A&E Home Video released the ''New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996\u20132001)'' DVD set.

It matched the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston Americans]] against the [[National League]] (NL) champion [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]{{NoteTag|In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the [[name of Pittsburgh]] was often spelled without the 'h'.}} in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.\n\nPittsburgh pitcher [[Sam Leever]] injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate [[Deacon Phillippe]] pitched five complete games. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Cy Young]] led Boston to victory. In Game&nbsp;1, Phillippe struck out ten Boston batters. The next day, Dinneen bettered that mark, striking out eleven Pittsburgh batters in Game&nbsp;2.\n\n[[Honus Wagner]], bothered by injuries, batted only 6 for 27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors.  The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance.  The following spring, Wagner (who in 1903 led the league in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a \"Hall of Fame\" for batting champions. \"I was too bum last year\", he wrote. \"I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?  I would be ashamed to have my picture up now.\"<ref name=\"devaleria95\">{{cite book | editor1-last = DeValeria | editor1-first = Dennis | editor2-first = Jeanne | editor2-last = Burke | title = Honus Wagner: A Biography | location = Pittsburgh | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press | year = 1995 | ref = devaleria95}}</ref>{{rp|page=138}}\n\nDue to overflow crowds at the [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]] games in [[Allegheny City]],{{NoteTag|From 1882\u20131906, the team played in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], which became annexed by [[Pittsburgh]] as the [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]] in 1907.}} if a batted ball rolled under a rope in the outfield that held spectators back, a \"ground-rule triple\" would be scored.

Such a large comeback would not happen again until the Pirates came back to defeat the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] in the [[1925 World Series]], and has happened only eleven times in baseball history. (The Pirates themselves repeated this feat in {{wsy|1979}} against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].) Much was made of the influence of Boston's \"[[Royal Rooters]]\", who traveled to Exposition Park and sang their theme song \"[[Tessie]]\" to distract the opposing players (especially Wagner). Boston wound up winning three out of four games in Allegheny City.\n\nPirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]] added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.\n\nThe Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.\n\n==Background==\n\n===A new league===\nIn 1901, [[Ban Johnson]], president of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], a minor league organization, formed the [[American League]] to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.  Johnson and fellow owners raided the National League and signed away many star players, including [[Cy Young]] and [[Jimmy Collins]].  Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=99}} The constant raiding, however, nixed the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a post-season contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock its roster with all-stars.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=105}}  However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in [[Pittsburgh]] and even attempted to raid the Pirates' roster in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss.  At the end of the season, however, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=102}}\n\nThe leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902\u201303 and formed the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|National Commission]] to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates had secured their respective championship pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an eleven-game championship series.  Encouraged by Johnson and National League President [[Harry Pulliam]], Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburgh in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Allegheny City, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=122}}\n\nOne significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for {{wsy|1904}}. The formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event started in {{wsy|1905}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsmenu.shtml|title=World Series : A Comprehensive History of the World Series by Baseball Almanac|last=http://www.geisleryoung.com/|first=Geisler Young, LLC -|website=www.baseball-almanac.com|access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==The teams==\n[[File:1903 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1903 Pittsburgh Pirates]]\nThe Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line-up that included legendary shortstop [[Honus Wagner]], who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager [[Fred Clarke]], who hit .351, and [[Ginger Beaumont]], who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs.

[[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Long Tom Hughes]], right-handers like Young, had won 21 games and 20 games each. The Boston outfield, featuring [[Chick Stahl]] (.274), [[Buck Freeman]] (.287, 104 [[RBI]]s) and [[Patsy Dougherty]] (.331, 101 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored) was considered excellent.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=124}}\n\n[[File:1903 World Series - Boston Americans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1903 Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates]]\nAlthough the Pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years, they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes. [[Otto Krueger (baseball)|Otto Krueger]], the team's only [[utility player]], was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series. 16-game winner [[Ed Doheny]] left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of [[paranoia]]; he was committed to an [[insane asylum]] the following month.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=122}} Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a [[trapshooting]] competition). Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore thumb throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|pages=122\u2013123}}\n\nSome sources say Boston were heavy underdogs. Boston [[bookies]] actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because Dreyfuss and other \"sports\" were alleged to have bet on Pittsburgh to bring down the odds).<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=124}} The teams were generally thought to be evenly matched, with the Americans credited with stronger pitching and the Pirates with superior offense and fielding. The outcome, many believed, hinged on Wagner's health. \"If Wagner does not play, bet your money at two to one on Boston\", said the ''[[Sporting News]]'', \"but if he does play, place your money at two to one on Pittsburg.\"<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|at=quoted in p. 124}}\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:1903WorldSeries.png|thumb|right]]\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary=AL [[Boston Americans]] (5) vs. NL [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (3)\n| winner=\n| score=\n| score1='''Pittsburgh Pirates''' \u2013 7, Boston Americans \u2013 3\n| date1=October 1\n| loc1=[[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]]\n| time1=1:55\n| att1=16,242\n| ref1=<ref name=\"Game1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10010BOS1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 1 \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Boston Americans|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score2=Pittsburgh Pirates \u2013 0, '''Boston Americans''' \u2013 3\n| date2=October 2\n| loc2=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds\n| time2=1:47\n| att2=9,415\n| ref2=<ref name=\"Game2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10020BOS1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 2 \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Boston Americans|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score3='''Pittsburgh Pirates''' \u2013 4, Boston Americans \u2013 2\n| date3=October 3\n| loc3=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds\n| time3=1:50\n| att3=18,801\n| ref3=<ref name=\"Game3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10030BOS1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 3 \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Boston Americans|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score4=Boston Americans \u2013 4, '''Pittsburgh Pirates''' \u2013 5\n| date4=October 6\n| loc4=[[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park (III)]]\n| time4=1:30\n| att4=7,600\n| ref4=<ref name=\"Game4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10060PIT1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 4 \u2013 Boston Americans vs. Pittsburgh Pirates|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score5='''Boston Americans''' \u2013 11, Pittsburgh Pirates \u2013 2\n| date5=October 7\n| loc5=Exposition Park (III)\n| time5=2:00\n| att5=12,322\n| ref5=<ref name=\"Game5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10070PIT1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 5 \u2013 Boston Americans vs. Pittsburgh Pirates|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score6='''Boston Americans''' \u2013 6, Pittsburgh Pirates \u2013 3\n| date6=October 8\n| loc6=Exposition Park (III)\n| time6=2:02\n| att6=11,556\n| ref6=<ref name=\"Game6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10080PIT1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 6 \u2013 Boston Americans vs. Pittsburgh Pirates|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score7='''Boston Americans''' \u2013 7, Pittsburgh Pirates \u2013 3\n| date7=October 10\n| loc7=Exposition Park (III)\n| time7=1:45\n| att7=17,038\n| ref7=<ref name=\"Game7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10100PIT1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 7 \u2013 Boston Americans vs. Pittsburgh Pirates|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score8=Pittsburgh Pirates \u2013 0, '''Boston Americans''' \u2013 3\n| date8=October 13\n| loc8=Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds\n| time8=1:35\n| att8=7,455\n| ref8=<ref name=\"Game8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1903/B10130BOS1903.htm|title=1903 World Series Game 8 \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Boston Americans|accessdate=September 13, 2009|work=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Matchups==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Game 1===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1903 world series crowd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crowd outside the Huntington Avenue Grounds before Game 3 of the 1903 World Series]] -->\n\nThursday, October 1, 1903, at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds|Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]\n\nThe Pirates started Game&nbsp;1 strong, scoring six runs in the first four innings.

BTV also infects goats, cattle and other domestic animals as well as wild ruminants (for example, blesbuck, white-tailed deer, elk, and pronghorn antelope).<ref name = roy/>\n\nMajor [[sign (medicine)|signs]] are high fever, excessive [[saliva]]tion, [[edema|swelling]] of the face  and tongue and [[cyanosis]] of the tongue. Swelling of the lips and tongue gives the tongue its typical blue appearance, though this sign is confined to a minority of the animals. Nasal signs may be prominent, with nasal discharge and [[stertorous]] respiration.\n\nSome animals also develop foot lesions, beginning with coronitis, with consequent lameness. In sheep, this can lead to knee-walking. In cattle, constant changing of position of the feet gives bluetongue the nickname '''The Dancing Disease'''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7019511.stm |title='Dancing' disease set for long run |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Matt | last=McGrath |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> Torsion of the neck ([[opisthotonos]] or [[torticollis]]) is observed in severely affected animals.\n\nNot all animals develop signs, but all those that do lose condition rapidly, and the sickest die within a week. For affected animals which do not die, recovery is very slow, lasting several months.\n\nThe [[incubation period]] is 5\u201320 days, and all signs usually develop within a month. The [[mortality rate]] is normally low, but it is high in susceptible [[breed]]s of sheep. In Africa, local breeds of sheep may have no mortality, but in imported breeds it may be up to 90 percent.<ref>''Handbook of Animal Diseases in the Tropics'', 1976. {{ISBN|0-901028-10-X}}</ref>\n\nIn cattle, goats and wild ruminants [[infection]] is usually [[asymptomatic]] despite high virus levels in blood.

The virus makes initial contact with the cell with VP2, triggering [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] of the virus.  The low pH within the [[endosome]] then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change that disrupts the endosomal membrane.<ref name=\"Roy2008\"/>  Uncoating yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 in addition to the dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived ''in vitro'' from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.<ref name=roy>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Roy P|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Dissection of Bluetongue Virus|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|pages=305\u2013354| ISBN =978-1-904455-22-6}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n[[File:Map of molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus in Europe.gif|thumb|280px|The molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe since 1998: routes of introduction of different serotypes and individual virus strains.]]\nBluetongue has been observed in Australia, the USA, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe.

The relatively recent novel vector has facilitated a far more rapid spread than the simple expansion of habitats North through global warming.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn August 2006, cases of bluetongue were found in the Netherlands, then Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.<ref>{{cite press release\n  | title = Blue Tongue confirmed in Belgium and Germany   | publisher = [[European Commission]]   | date = 2006-08-21\n  | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1113&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|accessdate =  2006-08-21}}</ref><ref name = \"jdfxyd\">{{cite press release   | title = Lethal horse disease knocking on Europe's door   | publisher = Horsetalk.co.nz  | date = 2007-03-28  | url = http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/archives/2007/03/165.shtml  | accessdate =  2007-03-27}}</ref> \nIn 2007, the first case of bluetongue in the Czech Republic was detected in one bull near [[Cheb]] at the Czech-German border.<ref>{{cite web   | title = Bluetongue dob\u00fdv\u00e1 Evropskou unii   | publisher = Agroweb   | date = 2008-02-19   | url = http://www.krmivarstvi.cz/zivocisna-vyroba/Bluetongue-dobyva-Evropskou-unii__s45x29979.html   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306005903/http://www.krmivarstvi.cz/zivocisna-vyroba/Bluetongue-dobyva-Evropskou-unii__s45x29979.html   | dead-url = yes   | archive-date = 2009-03-06   | accessdate = 2008-05-29   }}</ref> \nIn September 2007, the UK reported its first ever suspected case of the disease, in a Highland cow on a rare breeds farm near [[Ipswich, Suffolk]].<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = Bluetongue disease detected in UK   | publisher = [[BBC News Online]]   | date = 2007-09-22   | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7008788.stm\n  | accessdate =  2007-09-22 }}</ref> \nSince then the virus has spread from cattle to sheep in Britain.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = Bluetongue spreads from cattle to sheep   | publisher = [[Telegraph.co.uk]]   | date = 2007-10-14   | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566090/Bluetongue-spreads-from-cattle-to-sheep.html   | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Gray }}</ref> \nBy October 2007 bluetongue had become a serious threat in Scandinavia and Switzerland<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Bluetongue \u2013 Europe (50)\n  | publisher = International Society for Infectious Diseases\n  | date = 2007-10-30\n  | url = http://www.promedmail.org/pls/promed/f?p=2400:1001:6789444728823816325::::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_ARCHIVE_NUMBER,F2400_P1001_USE_ARCHIVE:1001,20071030.3522,Y\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-31\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226015919/http://www.promedmail.org/pls/promed/f?p=2400%3A1001%3A6789444728823816325%3A%3A%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_ARCHIVE_NUMBER%2CF2400_P1001_USE_ARCHIVE%3A1001%2C20071030.3522%2CY\n  | archivedate = December 26, 2007\n  | deadurl = yes\n  | df = \n  }}</ref> \nand the first outbreak in Denmark was reported.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL13660817 \"Bluetongue outbreak detected in Denmark \u2013 EU\"], [[Reuters]], 13 October 2007.</ref> In autumn 2008, several cases were reported in the southern Swedish provinces of Sm\u00e5land, Halland, and Sk\u00e5ne,<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Blue tongue outbreak spreads south   | publisher = [[Thelocal.se]]   | date = 2008-09-24   | url = http://www.thelocal.se/14538/20080924/\n  | accessdate = 2008-09-24 }}</ref>\nas well as in areas of the Netherlands bordering Germany, prompting veterinary authorities in Germany to intensify controls.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Blauzungenkrankheit in Niederlanden wieder ausgebrochen\n  | publisher = [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]\n  | date = 2008-09-26\n  | url = http://www.wdr.de/themen/kurzmeldungen/2008/10/26/sperrzonen_im_kreis_viersen.jhtml\n  | accessdate = 2008-09-27\n  }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nNorway saw its first finding in February 2009, when cows at two farms in [[Vest-Agder]] in the south of Norway showed an immune response to bluetongue.<ref>[http://www.vetinst.no/nor/Nyheter/Blaatunge-paavist-i-Norge Veterin\u00e6rinstituttet informs about the outbreak in Vest-Agder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306004518/http://www.vetinst.no/nor/Nyheter/Blaatunge-paavist-i-Norge |date=2009-03-06 }}, Norway National Veterinary Institute, 20 February 2009.</ref> Norway have since been declared free of the disease in 2011.\n\nAlthough the disease is not a threat to humans the most vulnerable common domestic ruminants in the UK are cattle, goats and, especially, sheep.\n\n===Overwintering===\nA puzzling aspect of BTV is its survival between midge seasons in temperate regions. Adult ''Culicoides'' are killed by cold winter temperatures, and BTV infections typically do not last for more than 60 days, which is not long enough for BTV to last until the next spring. It is believed that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges or animals. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed.  A few adult ''Culicoides'' midges infected with BTV may survive the mild winters of the temperate zone.  Some midges may even move indoors to avoid the cold temperature of the winter.  Additionally, BTV could cause a chronic or latent infection in some animals, providing another means for BTV to survive the winter.  BTV can also be transmitted from mother to fetus.  The outcome is abortion or stillbirth if fetal infection occurs early in gestation and survival if infection occurs late.  However infection at an intermediate stage, before the fetal immune system is fully developed, may result in a chronic infection that lingers until the first months after birth of the lamb. Midges will then spread the pathogen from the calves to other animals, starting a new season of infection.<ref name=Wilson2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson A, Darpel K, Mellor PS |title=Where does bluetongue virus sleep in the winter? |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e210 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18752350 |pmc=2525685 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060210 |url=}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prevention==\nPrevention is effected via [[quarantine]], [[inoculation]] with live modified virus [[vaccine]] and control of the midge [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], including inspection of aircraft.\n\n===Livestock management and insect control===\nHowever, simple husbandry changes and practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock during times of maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The ''[[Culicoides]]'' midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites.<ref>Gairdner, Julie.

However, the disease found in northern Europe (including the UK) in 2006 and 2007 has been caused by serotype 8. Vaccine companies Fort Dodge Animal Health ([[Wyeth]]), Merial and Intervet were developing vaccines against serotype 8 (Fort Dodge Animal Health has serotype 4 for sheep, serotype 1 for sheep and cattle and serotype 8 for sheep and cattle) and the associated production facilities. A vaccine for this is now available in the UK, produced by Intervet. Fort Dodge Animal Health has their vaccines available for multiple European Countries (vaccination will start in 2008 in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and Italy). However, immunization with any of the available vaccines preclude later serological monitoring of affected cattle populations, a problem which could be resolved using next-generation subunit vaccines currently in development.<ref name=\"ANDERSON_2013\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson J, H\u00e4gglund S, Br\u00e9ard E, Comtet L, L\u00f6vgren Bengtsson K, Pringle J, Zientara S, Valarcher JF |title=Evaluation of the immunogenicity of an experimental DIVA subunit vaccine against Bluetongue virus serotype 8 in cattle |journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology |volume= 20|issue= 8|pages= 1115\u201322|year=2013 |pmid=23720365 |doi=10.1128/CVI.00229-13 |pmc=3754508}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, Indian researchers launched its vaccine.

Legal Engineering is a legal-technical consultancy which specializes in resolving copyright infringement in relation to open source software.\n\n==Early life==\nPerens grew up in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

After that, he worked at [[Pixar]] for 12 years, from 1987 to 1999. He is credited as a studio tools engineer on the Pixar films ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998) and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0673302/ Bruce Perens] on IMDb.</ref>\n\n===No-Code International===\nPerens founded No-Code International in 1998 with the goal of ending the Morse Code test then required for an [[amateur radio]] license. His rationale was that amateur radio should be a tool for young people to learn advanced technology and networking, rather than something that preserved antiquity and required new hams to master outmoded technology before they were allowed on the air.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\nPerens lobbied intensively on the [[Internet]], at amateur radio events in the United States, and during visits to other nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eham.net/articles/12727|title=No-Code International Waged 'Battle':|website=www.eham.net|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> One of his visits was to Iceland, where he had half of that nation's radio amateurs in the room, and their vote in the International Amateur Radio Union was equivalent to that of the entire United States.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n===BusyBox===\nIn 1995, Perens created [[BusyBox]], a package of [[Unix|UNIX]]-style utilities for operating systems including [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]]. He stopped working on it in 1996, after which it was taken over by other developers.\n\nStarting in 2007, several lawsuits were filed for infringement of BusyBox copyright and licensing. These lawsuits were filed by the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] (SFLC), and some of the later managing developers of BusyBox.\n\nIn 2009, Bruce Perens released a statement about the lawsuits and [[plaintiff|those filing them]]. In it, he claims that he maintains a significant or even majority ownership of the software in the litigation, but was not contacted nor represented by the plaintiffs; and that some of the plaintiffs had themselves modified BusyBox and its distribution package in such a way as to violate applicable licensing terms and copyright owned by Perens and additional BusyBox developers. Perens supports enforcement of the GPL license used on Busybox. Because he was denied participation in the Busybox cases on the side of the prosecution, Perens started a consulting business to assist the defendants in coming into compliance with the GPL and arriving at an amicable settlement with the Software Freedom Law Center.\n\n===Debian Project Leader===\nFrom April 1996 to December 1997, while still working at Pixar, Perens served as [[Debian#Organization|Debian Project Leader]], the person who coordinates development of the [[Debian]] open source operating system. He replaced [[Ian Murdock]], the creator of Debian, who had been the first project leader.\n\n===Software in the Public Interest===\nIn 1997, Perens was a co-founder of [[Software in the Public Interest]] (SPI), a [[nonprofit organization]] intended to serve as an umbrella organization to aid open-source software and hardware projects. It was originally created to allow the [[Debian|Debian Project]] to accept donations.\n\n===Debian Social Contract===\nIn 1997,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perens|first1=Bruce|title=About The Creation of the Open Source Definition|url=http://blog.algoram.com/blog/2014/11/24/about-the-creation-of-the-open-source-definition-and-the-debian-social-contract/|website=Algoram|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref> Perens carbon-copied an email conversation between Donnie Barnes of Red Hat and Ean Schuessler, who was then working on Debian. Schuessler bemoaned that Red Hat had never stated its social contract with the Open Source community. Perens took this as inspiration to create a formal social contract for Debian. In a blog posting, Perens claims not to have made use of the Three Freedoms (later the Four Freedoms) published by the Free Software Foundation in composing his document. Perens proposed a draft of the Debian Social Contract to the Debian developers on the debian-private mailing list early in June 1997. Debian developers contributed discussion and changes for the rest of the month while Perens edited, and the completed document was then announced as Debian project policy. Part of the Debian Social Contract was the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], a set of 10 guidelines for determining whether a set of software can be described as \"free software\", and thus whether it could be included in Debian.\n\n===Open Source Definition and The Open Source Initiative===\nOn February 3, 1998, a group of people (not including Perens) met at VA Linux Systems to discuss the promotion of Free Software to business in pragmatic terms, rather than the moral terms preferred by [[Richard Stallman]]. Christine Petersen of the nanotechnology organization Foresight Institute, who was present because Foresight took an early interest in Free Software, suggested the term \"Open Source\". The next day, Eric S. Raymond recruited Perens to work with him on the formation of Open Source. Perens modified the Debian Free Software Guidelines into the Open Source Definition by removing Debian references and replacing them with \"Open Source\".\n\nThe original announcement of [[The Open Source Definition]] was made on February 9, 1998 on [[Slashdot]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=98/02/09/213900 |title=Free Software's New Name |publisher=Slashdot |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> and elsewhere; the definition was given in [[Linux Gazette]] on February 10, 1998.<ref name=\"LG\"/>\n\nConcurrently, Perens and Raymond established the [[Open Source Initiative]], an organization intended to promote open source software.\n\nPerens left OSI in 1999, a year after co-founding it. In February 1999 in an email to the Debian developers mailing list he explained his decision and stated that, though \"most hackers know that Free Software and Open Source are just two words for the same thing\", the success of \"open source\" as a marketing term had \"de-emphasized the importance of the freedoms involved in Free Software\"; he added, \"It's time for us to fix that.\" He stated his regret that OSI co-founder Eric Raymond \"seems to be losing his free software focus.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/debian-devel-199902/msg01641.html|author=Bruce Perens |title=It's Time to Talk About Free Software Again |publisher=Lists.debian.org |date=1999-02-17|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> But in the following 2000s he spoke about Open source again.<ref name=\"10yearsoss\"/><ref name=\"meet the perens\"/>\n\n===Linux Capital Group===\nIn 1999, Perens left Pixar and became the president of Linux Capital Group, a business incubator and [[venture capital]] firm focusing on Linux-based businesses. Their major investment was in [[Progeny Linux Systems]], a company headed by Debian founder Ian Murdock. In 2000, as a result of the economic downturn, Perens shut down Linux Capital Group.<ref>[https://archive.is/20131104101155/http://www.ageofpeers.com/resources/transcripts/transcript-bruce-perens-about-marketing-open-source-software Transcript of Bruce Perens about Marketing Open Source Software], ''Age of Peers''</ref> (Progeny Linux Systems would end operations in 2007.)\n\n===Hewlett-Packard===\nFrom December 2000 to September 2002, Perens served as \"Senior Global Strategist for Linux and Open Source\" at [[Hewlett-Packard]], internally evangelizing for the use of Linux and other open-source software.

Stanco was director of the laboratory for a year, while its regular director was on sabbatical.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, Perens was a visiting lecturer and researcher for the [[University of Agder]] under a three-year grant from the Competence Fund of Southern Norway.

He was the keynote of CISL - Conferencia Internacional de Software Libre, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and keynoted a special event along with the Minister of software and innovation of Chubut Province, in Puerto Madrin, Patagonia, Argentina. He keynoted the Festival de Software Libre 2013, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.\n\nIn 2014-2015, Perens took a break from Open Source conferences, having spoken at them often since 1996. In 2016, he returned to the conference circuit, keynoting the Open Source Insight conference in Seoul, sponsored by the Copyright Commission of South Korea. Perens web site presently advertises his availability to keynote conferences as long as travel and lodging expenses are compensated.\n\n==Views==\nPerens poses \"Open Source\" as a means of marketing the [[free and open-source software]] idea to business people and mainstream who might be more interested in the practical benefits of an open source development model and ecosystem than abstract ethics. He states that open source and free software are only two ways of talking about the same phenomenon, a point of view not shared by Stallman and his [[Free software]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25169 |title=Review: Perens Speaks about Free Software in Copenhagen |publisher=Technocrat.net |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223025659/http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25169/ |archivedate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25149 |title=Review: Perens Speaks about Free Software in Copenhagen |publisher=Technocrat.net |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223025914/http://technocrat.net/d/2007/8/17/25149/ |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}</ref> Perens postulated in 2004 an economic theory for business use of Open Source in his paper ''The Emerging Economic Paradigm of Open Source'' and his speech ''Innovation Goes Public''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mondrian.die.udec.cl/~mmedina/Desvarios/Files/Perens%20-%20The%20Emerging%20Economics%20of%20Open%20Source%20Software.pdf |title=The Emerging Economics of Open Source Software |publisher=Perens.com |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2014-11-24}}</ref> This differs from Raymond's theory in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'', which having been written before there was much business involvement in open source, explains open source as a consequence of programmer motivation and leisure.\n\nIn February 2008, for the 10th anniversary of the phrase \"open source\", Perens published a message to the community called \"State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source\".<ref name=\"10yearsoss\">{{cite web|url=http://perens.com/works/articles/State8Feb2008.html |title=Bruce Perens - State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source |publisher=Perens.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104135143/http://perens.com/works/articles/State8Feb2008.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 }}</ref> Around the same time the ezine RegDeveloper published an interview with Perens where he spoke of the successes of open source, but also warned of dangers, including a proliferation of OSI-approved licenses which had not undergone legal scrutiny.

Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties.  In particular, there is no ''[[substance theory|substance]]'' in which the properties are ''[[inherence|inherent]]''.\n\n==Arguments for the bundle theory==\nThe difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.\n\nThe inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a ''bare particular'' (a ''substance'' without properties), an implication that directly opposes [[substance theory]].  The conceptual difficulty of ''bare particulars'' was illustrated by [[John Locke]] when he described a ''substance'' by itself, apart from its properties, as ''\"something, I know not what. [...] The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding.\"''<ref>John Locke: An essay concerning human understanding (1689), Chapter XXIII, Of our Complex Ideas of Substances</ref>\n\nWhether a ''relation'' of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument.  However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of ''bare particulars'' leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.\n\n==Objections to the bundle theory==\nBundle theory maintains that properties are ''bundled'' together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100&nbsp;mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying ''substance''. The apple is said to be a ''bundle of properties'' including redness, being four inches (100&nbsp;mm) wide, and juiciness.\n\nCritics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' (the ''togetherness'' relation between those properties) without an underlying ''substance''. Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no ''substance'' in which they both ''inhere''.\n\nTraditional bundle theory explains the ''compresence'' of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties ''bound'' together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the \"looks like an apple\" property.\n\nBy contrast, [[substance theory]] explains the ''compresence'' of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the ''substance'' that has those properties. In substance theory, a ''substance'' is the thing in which properties ''inhere''. For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness ''inhere'' in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.\n\nThe ''bundle theory of substance'' explains ''compresence''. Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a ''substance''. Thus, it determines ''substancehood'' empirically by the ''togetherness'' of properties rather than by a ''bare particular'' or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The ''bundle theory of substance'' thus rejects the substance theories of [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], and more recently, [[J. P. Moreland]], Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, [[Quentin Smith]], and others.\n\n==Bundle theory and Buddhism==\nThe Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] philosopher, [[Chandrakirti]], used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of [[essence]] in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, ''[[Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra|Guide to the Middle Way]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Madhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra''), he says:\n\n{{quote|[The self] is like a cart, which is not other than its parts, not non-other, and does not possess them. It is not within its parts, and its parts are not within it. It is not the mere collection, and it is not the shape.<ref>Chandrakiri, ''Guide to the Middle Way'', VI.151, translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', p. 327</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.\n\nAnother view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.<ref>James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity'', University Press of America, 1997.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Platonic

At [[M\u00e9teren]], near the Belgian border at [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]], he was shot through the right [[human lung|lung]] by a sniper, during the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. He returned to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a general staff officer and took part in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April/May 1917.

This command included the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], a turning point in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. He subsequently commanded the British Eighth Army during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy]]. He was in command of all Allied ground forces during [[Operation Overlord|Operation ''Overlord'']] from the initial landings until after the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. He then continued in command of the [[21st Army Group]] for the rest of the [[North West Europe Campaign|campaign in North West Europe]]. As such he was the principal field commander for the [[Operation Market Garden|failed airborne attempt to bridge the Rhine]] at [[Battle of Arnhem|Arnhem]], and the [[Operation Plunder|Allied Rhine crossing]].

[[Bishop]] Montgomery considered it his duty to spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of [[Colony of Tasmania|Tasmania]] and was away for up to six months at a time. While he was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children \"constant\" beatings,<ref>Hamilton, p. 31 (1981)</ref> then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife.

He had stabilised the Allied position at the [[First Battle of El Alamein]], but after a visit in August 1942, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], replaced him as C-in-C with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] and [[William Gott]] as commander of the Eighth Army in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]]. However, after Gott was killed flying back to [[Cairo]] Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]] for [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[French North Africa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Gleave|2004c|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref>\n\nA story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that the appointment caused Montgomery to remark that \"After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult.\" A colleague is supposed to have told him to cheer up \u2013 at which point Montgomery said \"I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]]!\"<ref>Churchill, p. 420. According to J. Toland, ''Battle: The Story of the Bulge'', 1959, p. 157, this conversation was with Churchill's chief military assistant, General [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Ismay]], beginning with Montgomery saying to Ismay, \"It's a sad thing that a professional soldier can reach the peak of generalship and then suffer a reverse which ruins his career.\"</ref>\n\nMontgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of the Eighth Army.<ref name=\"Playfair370\">{{harvnb|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Gleave|2004c|p=370}}</ref> Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]], which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. [[Correlli Barnett]] commented that Montgomery's solution \"...&nbsp;was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Barnett|1960|p=265}}</ref> Montgomery reinforced the {{convert|30|mi|km}} long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions ([[51st (Highland) Division|51st Highland]] and [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th Home Counties]]) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations.<ref name=\"Playfair370\"/>\n\nMontgomery was determined that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, [[Erwin Rommel]], to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. \"I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal. If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat.

The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1986|pp=546\u201348}}</ref> Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready.

Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500).<ref>{{harvnb|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Gleave|2004d|p=78}}</ref> Soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud.

One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen recalled that to motivate a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88mm guns to fight against the British tanks that he had to hold his handgun to his head \"...and asked him whether he would like to be killed immediately or get a high decoration.

The operation was a strategic Allied success in drawing in the last German reserves in Normandy towards the Caen sector away from the American sector, greatly assisting the American break out in Operation Cobra. By the end of Goodwood on 25 July 1944, the Canadians had finally taken Caen while the British tanks had reached the plains south of Caen, giving Montgomery the \"hinge\" he had been seeking, while forcing the Germans to commit the last of their reserves to stop the Anglo-Canadian offensive.<ref name=\"Urban, p. 285\">{{harvnb|Urban|2005|p=285}}</ref> Ultra decrypts indicated that the Germans now facing Bradley were seriously understrength with Operation Cobra about to commence.<ref>{{harvnb|Baxter|1999|p=75}}</ref> During Operation Goodwood, the British had 400 tanks knocked out with many recovered returning to service.

Thus, while Monty taunted the enemy at Caen, we [the Americans] were to make our break on the long roundabout road to Paris. When reckoned in terms of national pride, this British decoy mission became a sacrificial one, for while we tramped around the outside flank, the British were to sit in place and pin down the Germans. Yet strategically it fitted into a logical division of labors, for it was towards Caen that the enemy reserves would race once the alarm was sounded.<ref>{{harvnb|Baxter|1999|p=72}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe long running dispute over what Montgomery's \"master plan\" in Normandy was, led historians to differ greatly about the purpose of Goodwood. The British journalist [[Mark Urban]], wrote that the purpose of Goodwood was to draw German troops to their left flank to allow the Americans to breakout on the right flank, arguing that Montgomery had to lie to his soldiers about the purpose of Goodwood as the average British soldier would not have understood why they were being asked to create a diversion to allow the Americans to have the glory of staging the breakout with Operation Cobra.<ref name=\"Urban, p. 285\"/> By contrast, the American historian Stephen Power argued that Goodwood was intended to be the \"breakout\" offensive and not a \"holding operation\", writing: \"It is unrealistic to assert that an operation which called for the use of 4,500 Allied aircraft, 700 artillery pieces and over 8,000 armored vehicles and trucks and that cost the British over 5,500 casualties was conceived and executed for so limited an objective\".<ref>{{harvnb|Powers|1992|pp=462\u2013463}}</ref> Power noted that Goodwood and Cobra were supposed to take effect on the same day, 18 July 1944, but Cobra was cancelled owing to heavy rain in the American sector, and argued that both operations were meant to be breakout operations to trap the German armies in Normandy. American military writer Drew Middleton wrote that there is no doubt that Montgomery wanted Goodwood to provide a \"shield\" for Bradley, but at the same time Montgomery was clearly hoping for more than merely diverting German attention away from the American sector.<ref>{{cite web| last =  Middleton| first = Drew| title = Mistake in the Master Plan| publisher = ''New York Times''| date=22 January 1984| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/22/books/mistake-in-the-master-plan.html| accessdate = 6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>D'Este, p. 396 (1983).</ref> British historian [[John Keegan]] pointed out that Montgomery made differing statements before Goodwood about the purpose of the operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1994|pp=1994 191\u2013192}}</ref> Keegan wrote that Montgomery engaged in what he called a \"hedging of his bets\" when drafting his plans for Goodwood, with a plan for a \"break out if the front collapsed, if not, sound documentary evidence that all he had intended in the first place was a battle of attrition\".<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1994|p=192}}</ref> With Goodwood drawing the Wehrmacht towards the British sector, the First American Army enjoyed a two to one numerical superiority and General [[Omar Bradley]] had accepted Montgomery's advice to begin the offensive by concentrating at one point instead of a \"broad front\" as Eisenhower would have preferred.<ref name=\"Urban, p. 288\">{{harvnb|Urban|2005|p=288}}</ref>\n\nOperation Goodwood almost cost Montgomery his job, as Eisenhower seriously considered sacking him and only chose not to do so because to sack the popular \"Monty\" would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it.<ref>{{harvnb|Powers|1992|p=469}}</ref> Montgomery expressed his satisfaction at the results of Goodwood when calling the operation off.

The 21st Army Group would attack north from Belgium, {{convert|60|mi|km}} through the Netherlands, across the Rhine and consolidate north of Arnhem on the far side of the Rhine. The risky plan required three Airborne Divisions to capture numerous intact bridges along a single-lane road, on which an entire Corps had to attack and use as its main supply route. The offensive failed to achieve its objectives.<ref>A Bridge to Far, Cornelius Ryan.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Market Garden, Montgomery made holding the Arnhem salient his first priority, arguing that the 2nd British Army might still be able to break through and reach the wide open plains of northern Germany, and that he might be able to take the Ruhr by the end of October.<ref>Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.12 & 14</ref> In the meantime, the First Canadian Army, which been given the task of clearing the mouth of the river Scheldt, despite the fact that in the words of Copp and Vogel \"...that Montgomery's Directive required the Canadians to continue to fight alone for almost two weeks in a battle which everyone agreed could only be won with the aid of additional divisions\".<ref>Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.14</ref> For his part, Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], the German commander of the Western Front ordered General [[Gustav-Adolf von Zangen]], the commander of 15th Army that: \"The attempt of the enemy to occupy the West Scheldt in order to obtain the free use of the harbor of Antwerp must be ''resisted to the utmost''\" (emphasis in the original).<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.11\">Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.11</ref> Rundstedt argued with Hitler that as long as the Allies could not use the port of Antwerp, the Allies would lack the logistical capacity for an invasion of Germany.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.11\"/>\n\nMontgomery pulled away from the First Canadian Army (temporarily commanded now by Simonds as Crerar was ill), the British 51st Highland Division, 1st Polish Division, British 49th (West Riding) Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and sent all of these formations to help the 2nd British Army hold the Arnhem salient.<ref>Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.18</ref> However, Simonds seems to have regarded the Scheldt campaign as a test of his ability, and he felt he could clear the Scheldt with only three Canadian divisions, namely the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th, despite having to take on the entire 15th Army, which held strongly fortified positions in a landscape that favoured the defence.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.19-20\">Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.19-20</ref> Simonds never complained about the lack of air support (made worse by the cloudy October weather), shortages of ammunition or having insufficient troops, regarding these problems as challenges for him to overcome, rather than a cause for complaint.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.19-20\"/> As it was, Simonds made only slow progress in October 1944 during the fighting in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], although he was praised by Copp for imaginative and aggressive leadership who managed to achieve much, despite all of the odds against him.<ref>{{harvnb|Copp|2006|p=289}}</ref> Montgomery had little respect for the Canadian generals, whom he dismissed as mediocre, except for Simonds, whom he consistently praised as Canada's only \"first-rate\" general in the entire war.<ref name=\"Copp, 1981 p. 150\"/>\n\nAdmiral Ramsay, who proved to be a far more articulate and forceful champion of the Canadians than their own generals, starting on 9 October demanded of Eisenhower in a meeting that he either order Montgomery to make supporting the First Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting his number one priority or sack him.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42\">Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42</ref> Ramsay in very strong language argued to Eisenhower that the Allies could only invade Germany if Antwerp was opened, and that as long as the three Canadian divisions fighting in the Scheldt had shortages of ammunition and artillery shells because Montgomery made the Arnhem salient his first priority, then Antwerp would not be opened anytime soon.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42\"/> Even Brooke wrote in his diary: \"I feel that Monty's strategy for once is at fault. Instead of carrying out the advance to Arnhem he ought to have made certain of Antwerp\".<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42\"/> Prompted by Ramsay, Eisenhower sent Montgomery later on 9 October 1944, a cable that emphasizing the \"supreme importance of Antwerp\", stating that \"the Canadian Army will not, repeat not, be able to attack until November unless immediately supplied with adequate ammunition\", and finally warning that the Allied advance into Germany would totally stop by mid-November unless Antwerp was opened in October.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42\"/> Montgomery replied by accusing Ramsay of making \"wild statements\" unsupported by the facts, he denied that the Canadians were having to ration ammunition, and claimed that he would soon take the Ruhr, making the Scheldt campaign a sideshow.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.42\"/> Montgomery further issued a memo entitled \"Notes on Command in Western Europe\" demanding that he once again be made Land Forces Commander, which led to an exasperated Eisenhower telling Montgomery that the question was not the command arrangement, but rather his ability and willingness to obey orders, and that he either obey orders to clear the mouth of the Scheldt at once, or he would be sacked.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.43\">Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.43</ref>\n\nA chastised Montgomery told Eisenhower on 15 October 1944 that he was now making clearing the Scheldt his \"top priority\", and the ammunition shortages in the First Canadian Army, a problem which he denied even existed five days earlier, were now over as supplying the Canadians was henceforth his first concern.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.43\"/> Simonds, now reinforced with British troops and Royal Marines, cleared the Scheldt by taking [[Walcheren]] island, the last of the German \"fortresses\" on the Scheldt on 8 November 1944.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.127\">Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.127</ref> With the Scheldt in Allied hands, Royal Navy minesweepers removed the German mines in the river, and Antwerp was finally opened to shipping on 28 November 1944.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.127\"/> Reflecting Antwerp's importance, the Germans spent the winter of 1944\u201345 firing V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets at it in an attempt to shut down the port, and the German offensive in December 1944 in the Ardennes had as its ultimate objective the capture of Antwerp.<ref name=\"Copp & Vogel, 1985 p.127\"/> Urban wrote that Montgomery's most \"serious failure\" in the entire war was not the well publicised Battle of Arnhem, but rather his lack of interest in opening up Antwerp, as without it the entire Allied advance from the North Sea to the Swiss Alps stalled in the autumn of 1944 for logistical reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Urban|2005|p=298}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\nWhen the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the front of the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|US 12th Army Group]] was split, with the bulk of the [[First United States Army|US First Army]] being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The 12th Army Group commander, General [[Omar Bradley]], was located south of the penetration at Luxembourg and command of the US First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] in France) temporarily transferred [[Courtney Hodges]]' US First Army and [[William Hood Simpson|William Simpson]]'s [[Ninth United States Army|US Ninth Army]] to Montgomery's 21st Army Group until the \"bulge\" could be reduced and a simpler line of communications restored, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds.{{refn|See the official history {{Cite book|title=United States Army in World War II.

He grouped the [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of [[Sankt Vith|St Vith]]. The German commander of the [[5th Panzer Army]], [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] said:\n\n{{quote|The operations of the American First Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions.

A meticulously planned [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossing]] occurred on 24 March. While successful, it was two weeks after the Americans had unexpectedly (sans meticulous planning) [[Battle of Remagen|captured]] the (railway) [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at Remagen and crossed the river on 7 March. Montgomery's river crossing was followed by the [[Ruhr Pocket|encirclement]] of German [[Army Group B]] in the [[Ruhr]]. Initially Montgomery's role was to guard the flank of the American advance. This was altered to forestall any chance of a [[Red Army]] advance into Denmark, and the 21st Army Group occupied [[Hamburg]] and [[Rostock]] and sealed off the Danish peninsula.<ref name=odnb/> On 4 May 1945, on [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]], Montgomery accepted the [[German surrender at L\u00fcneburg Heath|surrender of German forces in north-west Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands]].<ref name=heath218>{{harvnb|Heathcote|1999|p=218}}</ref>\n\n==Casualty conservation policy==\nThe British high command were not concerned only with winning the war by defeating Germany, but also with ensuring that they were still considered to be a serious power after the war, able to influence global policy. Suffering heavy losses in Normandy would diminish Britain's Imperial influence on the post-war world, and on post-war Europe in particular.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=55}} Many of Montgomery's clashes with Eisenhower were based on his determination to pursue the war \"on lines most suitable to Britain\".{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=56}}\n\nThe fewer the number of combat-experienced divisions the British had left at the end of the war, the smaller Britain's influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the USA and the USSR. Montgomery was thus caught in a dilemma \u2013 the British Army needed to be seen to be pulling at least half the weight in the liberation of Europe, but without incurring the heavy casualties that such a role would inevitably produce. The 21st Army Group scarcely possessed sufficient forces to achieve such a military prominence, and the remaining divisions had to be expended sparingly.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=58}}\n\nBritain did not possess the resources in 1944 to rebuild shattered divisions and it was imperative for Montgomery to protect the viability of the British army so that Britain could still play an important part in the final victory. It was reported to the War Office that \"Montgomery has to be very careful of what he does on his eastern flank because on that flank is the only British Army there is left in this part of the world\". The context of British casualties and the shortage of reinforcements, prompted Montgomery to \"excessive caution\".{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=70}} Dempsey wrote on 13 June, that Caen could only be taken by a \"set piece assault and we did not have the men or the ammunition for that at the time\".{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nMontgomery's solution to the dilemma was to attempt to remain Commander of All Land Forces until the end of the war, so that any victory attained \u2013 although achieved primarily by American formations \u2013 would accrue in part to him and thus to Britain. He would also be able to ensure that British units were spared some of the high-attrition actions, but would be most prominent when the final blows were struck.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=59}} When that strategy failed, he persuaded Eisenhower to occasionally put some American formations under the control of the 21st Army Group, so as to bolster his resources while still maintaining the outward appearance of successful British effort.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=60}}\n\nMontgomery initially remained prepared to push Second (British) Army hard to capture the vital strategic town of Caen, and consequently incur heavy losses. In the original Overlord plan, Montgomery was determined to push past Caen to Falaise as quickly as possible. However, after the heavy casualties incurred in capturing Caen, he changed his mind.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=63}}\n\n==Lack of tact==\nMontgomery was notorious for his lack of tact and diplomacy. Even his \"patron,\" the Chief of the Imperial General Staff [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Lord Alanbrooke]], frequently mentions it in his war diaries: \"he is liable to commit untold errors in lack of tact\" and  \"I had to haul him over the coals for his usual lack of tact and egotistical outlook which prevented him from appreciating other people's feelings\".<ref>Alanbrooke, pp. 418/9, 516, 531, 550 & 638</ref> One incident that illustrated this occurred during the North African campaign when Montgomery bet [[Walter Bedell Smith]] that he could capture [[Sfax]] by the middle of April 1943. Smith jokingly replied that if Montgomery could do it he would give him a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Flying Fortress]] complete with crew. Smith promptly forgot all about it, but Montgomery did not, and when Sfax was taken on 10 April he sent a message to Smith \"claiming his winnings\". Smith tried to laugh it off, but Montgomery was having none of it and insisted on his aircraft. It got as high as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] who, with his renowned skill in diplomacy, ensured Montgomery did get his Flying Fortress, though at a great cost in ill feeling.<ref>{{harvnb|Corrigan|2010|p=312}}</ref><ref>Alan Brooke, p. 417 to 418</ref> Even Alanbrooke thought it \"crass stupidity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Alanbrooke|2001|p=418}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1945, whilst Alanbrooke, [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]] and [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]] were discussing their possible successors as \"Chiefs of Staff\", they concluded that Montgomery would be very efficient as CIGS from the Army's point of view but that he was also very unpopular with a large proportion of the Army.

The 1960 paperback edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might reasonably assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat \"into the Nile Delta or beyond\" and pointing out that it had been Auchinleck's intention to launch an offensive as soon as the Eighth Army was \"rested and regrouped\".<ref>{{harvnb|Montgomery|1960|p=14}}</ref> Montgomery was stripped of his honorary citizenship of [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.<ref>Per ''La Repubblica'' (22 February 1992), the duel challenge actually came from Vincenzo Caputo, a Sicilian lawyer.</ref>\n\nHe twice met [[Israel]]i general [[Moshe Dayan]]. After an initial meeting in the early 1950s, Montgomery met Dayan again in the 1960s to discuss the [[Vietnam War]], which Dayan was studying.

Montgomery said that the Americans' most important problem was that they had no clear-cut objective, and allowed local commanders to set military policy.

He is regarded as the founder of clinical teaching and of the modern academic hospital and is sometimes referred to as \"the father of physiology,\" along with Venetian physician [[Santorio Santorio]] (1561\u20131636). Boerhaave introduced the quantitative approach into medicine, along with his pupil [[Albrecht von Haller]] (1708\u20131777) and is best known for demonstrating the relation of symptoms to lesions. He was the first to isolate the chemical [[urea]] from urine. He was the first physician to put thermometer measurements to clinical practice. His motto was ''Simplex sigillum veri'': 'The simple is the sign of the true'. He is often hailed as the \"Dutch [[Hippocrates]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Oud Poelgeest Oegstgeest.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|[[Oud Poelgeest]] Castle, Herman Boerhaave's home in [[Oegstgeest]], near Leiden. This was the site of his outdoor botanical garden that was renowned during his lifetime and rivalled [[Hortus Cliffortianus]], the garden of his friend and sponsor to [[Linnaeus]]. He travelled back and forth to his friend's garden and to the Leiden University by [[trekschuit]].]]\nBoerhaave was born at [[Voorhout]] near [[Leiden]]. The son of a [[Protestant]] pastor,<ref>Robert Siegfried (2002). ''From Elements to Atoms: A History of Chemical Composition, Volume 92, Issues 4\u20136''. American Philosophical Society. p. 128</ref> in his youth Boerhaave studied for a [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] degree and wanted to become a preacher.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn, p.287\">Mendelsohn, p.287</ref> After the death of his father, however, he was offered a scholarship and he entered the [[University of Leiden]], where he took his degree in philosophy in 1689, with a dissertation ''De distinctione mentis a corpore'' (on the difference of the mind from the body).<ref>{{cite web|author=Herman Boerhaave |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Boerhaave_1690.pdf |title=De distinctione mentis a corpore |year=1690}}</ref> There he attacked the doctrines of [[Epicurus]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. He then turned to the study of medicine, in which he graduated in 1693 at [[University of Harderwijk|Harderwijk]] in present-day [[Gelderland]].\n\nIn 1701 he was appointed lecturer on the institutes of medicine at Leiden; in his inaugural discourse, ''De commendando [[Hippocrates|Hippocratis]] studio'', he recommended to his pupils that great physician as their model. In 1709 he became professor of [[botany]] and medicine, and in that capacity he did good service, not only to his own university, but also to botanical science, by his improvements and additions to the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|botanic garden of Leiden]], and by the publication of numerous works descriptive of new species of plants.\n\nOn 14 September 1710, Boerhaave married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of the rich merchant, Alderman Abraham Drolenvaux. They had four children, of whom one daughter, Maria Joanna, lived to adulthood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2404.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207020803/http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2404.html |archivedate=7 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In 1722, he began to suffer from an extreme case of [[gout]], recovering the next year.\n\nIn 1714, when he was appointed rector of the university, he succeeded [[Govert Bidloo]] in the chair of practical medicine, and in this capacity he introduced the modern system of clinical instruction. Four years later he was appointed to the chair of chemistry as well. In 1728 he was elected into the [[French Academy of Sciences]], and two years later into the [[Royal Society]] of London. In 1729 declining health obliged him to resign the chairs of chemistry and botany; and he died, after a lingering and painful illness, at Leiden.\n\n==Legacy==\nHis reputation so increased the fame of the University of Leiden, especially as a school of medicine, that it became popular with visitors from every part of Europe. All the princes of Europe sent him pupils, who found in this skilful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian. When [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] went to Holland in 1716 (he was in Holland before in 1697 to instruct himself in maritime affairs), he also took lessons from Boerhaave. [[Voltaire]] travelled to see him, as did [[Carl Linnaeus]], who became a close friend. His reputation was not confined to Europe; a Chinese mandarin sent him a letter addressed to \"the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe,\" and it reached him in due course.\n[[File:ErfgoedLeiden LEI001019039 Herman Boerhaave, bronzen standbeeld van J.Stracke (1817-1891).jpeg|thumb|Bronze statue made by J.Stracke (1817\u20131891)]]\nThe operating theatre of the University of Leiden in which he once worked as an anatomist is now at the centre of a museum named after him; the [[Boerhaave Museum]]. [[Asteroid]] [[8175 Boerhaave]] is named after Boerhaave. From 1955 to 1961 Boerhaave's image was printed on Dutch 20-[[guilder]] banknotes. The [[Leiden University Medical Centre]] organises medical trainings called ''Boerhaave-courses''.\n\nHe had a prodigious influence on the development of medicine and chemistry in Scotland. British medical schools credit Boerhaave for developing the system of medical education upon which their current institutions are based.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Underwood|first=E.

Clow ''The Chemical Revolution'', Batchworth Press, London, 1952.</ref>  \n \nBoerhaave first described [[Boerhaave syndrome]], which involves tearing of the oesophagus, usually a consequence of vigorous vomiting.  He notoriously described in 1724 the case of Baron Jan van Wassenaer, a Dutch admiral who died of this condition following a gluttonous feast and subsequent regurgitation.<ref>Boerhaave H.

Leiden, the Netherlands: Lugduni Batavorum Boutesteniana, 1724</ref>  This condition was uniformly fatal prior to modern surgical techniques allowing repair of the oesophagus.\n\nBoerhaave was critical of his [[Netherlands (terminology)#Dutch|Dutch]] contemporary, [[Baruch Spinoza]], attacking him in his dissertation in 1689. At the same time, he admired [[Isaac Newton]] and was a devout Christian who often wrote about God in his works.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn, p.287\"/> A collection of his religious thoughts on medicine, translated from Latin to English, has been compiled by the ''Sir Thomas Browne Instituut Leiden'' under the name ''Boerhaave\u00ecs Orations'' (meaning \"Boerhaavian Prayers\").<ref>Boerhaave, Herman (1983). edited by Elze Kegel-Brinkgreve & Antonie Maria Luyendijk-Elshout.

Descartes contributed much to iatromechanical theories. Another influencer of Boerhaave's reasoning was [[Giovanni Borelli]]. He was a distinguished astronomer and mathematician in the 1600s and published writings on animal motions mirroring machinery principles. Inspired by this and Cartesianism, Boerhaave proposed that the human body's operations are based on a hydraulic model.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Harold|title=Matters of Exchange|date=2007|publisher=Commerce, Medicine, and Science in the Dutch Golden Age|location=New Haven|pages=393}}</ref> In his work, he alluded to simple machines, such as levers and pulleys, as well as other mechanisms to explain parts of the body. Boerhaave described the body as made up of pipe-like structures such as are found in a machine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindemann|first1=Mary|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=University Printing House, Cambridge CB2, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-521-42592-6|pages=101\u2013105|edition=second}}</ref> For example, pipes in a machine parallel the physiology of veins in the human body. Boerhaave took this mechanistic notion even further by noting the importance of a proper balance of fluid pressure. Fluids within the body should be able to move around freely, without obstacles.  Similar to a machine, a well-being was self-regulating. The body must maintain these conditions to be a healthy equilibrium state. Boerhaave's view on medicine accepted this apparatus-like body philosophy and thus focused attention on materialistic problems rather than mystical explanations of illness.\n\nBoerhaave stressed the atomically research conceived on sense experiences and scientific experiments. Boerhaave attracted many students to Leiden University, where he taught his perception and philosophy. Boerhaave's notion of the systematic body burgeoned throughout Europe and consequently aiding in the transformation of medical educations in European schools.\nBoerhaave's intuition struck up a great deal of interest among other critical medical thinkers \u2013 one being [[Friedrich Hoffmann]], who emphasised using physico-mechanical principles to preserve and, if needed, restore health.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Broman|first1=Thomas|title=The Medical Sciences|date=2003|publisher=The Cambridge History of Sciences|location=Cambridge|pages=469}}</ref> As a professor at Leiden, Boerhaave influenced many of his students. Some of his followers conducted experiments to bolster Boerhaave's philosophy, while other physicians rejected and proposed alternative notions about the human body. Boerhaave also contributed a great number of textbooks and writings that circulated Europe. The enrichment extracted from his lectures at Leiden. In 1708, his publication of the Institutes of Medicine was issued in over five languages with approximately ten editions.

Instead of solely relying on past finding, Boerhaave understood the importance of seeking fixed results on his own and experiencing the findings first hand.

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who twice served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He played a central role in the creation of the [[History of the Conservative Party (UK)|modern Conservative Party]], defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and his [[one-nation conservatism]] or \"Tory democracy\". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the [[British Empire]]. He is the only British Prime Minister to have been [[British Jews|Jewish by birth]] and the first person from an ethnic minority background to hold one of the [[Great Offices of State]]. He was also a novelist, publishing works of fiction even as Prime Minister.\n\nDisraeli was born in [[Bloomsbury]], then a part of [[Middlesex]]. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his [[synagogue]]; young Benjamin became an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] at the age of 12.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1837. In 1846, Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] split the Conservatives over his proposal to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. As a result of his clashes with Peel in the House of Commons, Disraeli became a major Tory figure. When [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].\n\nUpon Derby's retirement in 1868, Disraeli became prime minister briefly before losing that year's general election. He returned to opposition until the general election of 1874, when he led the Tories as they won an outright majority.\n\nDisraeli's second term was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]\u2014the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the [[Congress of Berlin]] to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.\n\nWorld events thereafter moved against the Conservatives. The [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] and the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in South Africa undermined his public support. He angered British farmers by refusing to reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting [[Midlothian campaign|a massive speaking campaign]], his Liberals bested the Conservatives at [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|the 1880 general election]].\n\nDisraeli died on 19 April 1881 at the age of 76. In his final months, he led the Conservatives in opposition. He had always maintained a close friendship with [[Queen Victoria]], who in 1876 appointed him Earl of Beaconsfield. His last completed novel, ''[[Endymion (Disraeli novel)|Endymion]]'', was published in 1881 shortly before his death, more than 50 years after his first.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nDisraeli was born on 21 December 1804 at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, [[Bloomsbury]], London,{{refn|The street was renamed some time after 1824 as [[Theobald's Road]];<ref>Pierpoint, Robert.

Possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency, were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the rest of their marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of \u00a325,000 from Bentinck's brothers [[Lord Henry Bentinck]] and [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland|Lord Titchfield]].<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 251\u2013254</ref>\n\nWithin a month of his appointment Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without a leader in the Commons for the rest of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and [[John Charles Herries]]\u2014indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 266\u2013269</ref>\n\n==Office==\n\n===First Derby government===\n{{Main|Who? Who? ministry}}\n[[File:14th Earl of Derby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]], Prime Minister 1852, 1858\u201359, 1866\u201368|alt=A stately-looking gentleman in a dark suit, sitting with a book]]\n\nIn March 1851, Lord John Russell's [[Whig government, 1846\u20131852|government]] was defeated over a bill to equalise the county and borough franchises, mostly because of divisions among his supporters. He resigned, and the Queen sent for Stanley, who felt that a minority government could do little and would not last long, so Russell remained in office. Disraeli regretted this, hoping for an opportunity, however brief, to show himself capable in office.<ref>Weintraub, p. 303</ref> Stanley, on the other hand, deprecated his inexperienced followers as a reason for not assuming office, \"These are not names I can put before the Queen.\"<ref>Jenkins, p. 137</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1851, Stanley's father died, and he succeeded to his title as [[Earl of Derby]].<ref>Blake (1967), p. 307</ref> The Whigs were wracked by internal dissensions during the second half of 1851, much of which Parliament spent in recess. Russell dismissed [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] from the cabinet, leaving the latter determined to deprive the Prime Minister of office as well. Palmerston did so within weeks of Parliament's reassembly on 4 February 1852, his followers combining with Disraeli's Tories to defeat the government on a Militia Bill, and Russell resigned. Derby had either to take office or risk damage to his reputation<ref name = \"j138\">Jenkins, p. 138</ref> and he accepted the Queen's commission as Prime Minister. Palmerston declined any office; Derby had hoped to have him as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Disraeli, his closest ally, was his second choice and accepted, though disclaiming any great knowledge in the financial field. Gladstone refused to join the government.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 310\u2013311</ref> Disraeli may have been attracted to the office by the \u00a35,000 per year salary, which would help pay his debts.<ref name = \"h203\">Hibbert, p. 203</ref> Few of the new cabinet had held office before; when Derby tried to inform the [[Duke of Wellington]] of the names of the Queen's new ministers, the elderly Duke, who was somewhat deaf, inadvertently branded the new government by incredulously repeating \"Who? Who?\"<ref name = \"j138\" />\n\nIn the following weeks, Disraeli served as Leader of the House (with Derby as Prime Minister in the Lords) and as Chancellor. He wrote regular reports on proceedings in the Commons to Victoria, who described them as \"very curious\" and \"much in the style of his books\".<ref name = \"h203\" /> The Tories could not govern for long as a minority, and Parliament was [[Legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] on 1 July 1852; Disraeli hoped that they would gain a majority of about 40. Instead, [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|the election]] later that month had no clear winner, and the Derby government remained in power pending the meeting of Parliament.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 322\u2013323</ref>\n\nDisraeli's task as Chancellor was to devise a budget which would satisfy the protectionist elements who supported the Tories, without uniting the free-traders against it.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 328</ref> His proposed budget, which he presented to the Commons on 3 December, lowered the taxes on malt and tea, provisions designed to appeal to the working class. To make his budget revenue-neutral, as funds were needed to provide defences against the French, he doubled the house tax and continued the income tax.<ref name = \"w321\">Weintraub, p. 321</ref> Disraeli's overall purpose was to enact policies which would benefit the working classes, making his party more attractive to them.<ref>Aldous, p. 67</ref> Although the budget did not contain protectionist features, the opposition was prepared to destroy it\u2014and Disraeli's career as Chancellor\u2014in part out of revenge for his actions against Peel in 1846. MP [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]] predicted that the budget would fail because \"Jews make no converts\".<ref name = \"w321\" />\n\n[[File:Gladstone-by-Watts-1859.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] in the 1850s|alt=A middle-aged man in Victorian clothes]]\nDisraeli delivered the budget on 3 December 1852,<ref>Weintraub, p. 320</ref> and prepared to wind up the debate for the government on 16 December\u2014it was customary for the Chancellor to have the last word. A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, and then as a force, \"I face a Coalition&nbsp;... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions.\"<ref>Aldous, p. 70</ref> His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone rose to his feet and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down.<ref>Aldous, pp. 68\u201371</ref> The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]], with Gladstone as his Chancellor.<ref>Aldous, pp. 71\u201378</ref> Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 346\u2013347</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nWith the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches; he was to spend three-quarters of his 44-year parliamentary career in opposition. Derby was reluctant to seek to unseat the government, fearing a repetition of the 'Who? Who?' ministry, and knowing that despite his lieutenant's strengths, shared dislike of Disraeli was part of what had formed the governing coalition. Disraeli, on the other hand, was anxious to return to office. In the interim he, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 354\u2013357</ref>\n\nDisraeli was awarded an honorary degree by [[Oxford University]] in June 1853. He had been recommended for it by Lord Derby, the university's [[Chancellor of Oxford University|Chancellor]].<ref>Hibbert, pp. 212\u2013213</ref> The start of the [[Crimean War]] the following year caused a lull in party politics; Disraeli spoke patriotically in support. The British military efforts were marked by bungling, and in 1855 a restive Parliament considered a resolution to establish a committee on the conduct of the war. The Aberdeen government chose to make this a [[motion of confidence]]; Disraeli led the opposition to defeat the government, 305 to 148. Aberdeen resigned, and the Queen sent for Derby, who to Disraeli's frustration refused to take office.  Palmerston was deemed essential to any Whig ministry, and he would not join any he did not head. The Queen reluctantly asked Palmerston to form a government.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 359\u2013362</ref> Under Palmerston, the war went better, and was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] in early 1856. Disraeli was early to call for peace, but had little influence on events.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 344\u2013346</ref>\n\nWhen [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|a rebellion]] broke out in India in 1857, Disraeli took a keen interest in affairs, having been a member of a [[select committee]] in 1852 which considered how best to rule the subcontinent, and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the [[British East India Company]]. After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it. Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him and the bill passed the Commons easily.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 376\u2013377</ref>\n\nPalmerston's grip on the premiership was weakened by his response to the [[Orsini affair]], in which an attempt was made to assassinate the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] by an Italian revolutionary with a bomb made in Birmingham. At the request of the French ambassador, Palmerston put forward amendments to the [[conspiracy to murder]] statute, proposing to make creating an [[bomb|infernal device]] a felony rather than a misdemeanour. He was defeated by 19 votes on the second reading, with many Liberals crossing the aisle against him. He immediately resigned, and Lord Derby returned to office.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 377\u2013379</ref>\n\n===Second Derby government===\n{{Main|Second Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry}}\n\nDerby took office at the head of a purely \"Conservative\" administration, not in coalition with any other faction. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli was once more leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852, Derby led a [[minority government]], dependent on the division of its opponents for survival.<ref>Hawkins, Angus. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/175428 \"British Parliamentary Party Alignment and the Indian Issue, 1857\u20131858\"], ''The Journal of British Studies'', volume 23, issue 2, Spring 1984, pp. 79\u2013105 {{subscription}}</ref> As Leader of the House, Disraeli resumed his regular reports to Queen Victoria, who had requested that he include what she \"could not meet in newspapers\".<ref>Weintraub, pp. 369\u2013370</ref>\n\nDuring its brief life of just over a year, the Derby government proved moderately progressive. The [[Government of India Act 1858]] ended the role of the East India Company in governing the subcontinent.<ref>Aldous, p. 117</ref> It also passed the Thames Purification Bill, which funded the construction of much larger sewers for London.<ref>Wall Street Journal, \"The Stink that Sank London\", August 13, 2017</ref> Disraeli had supported efforts [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom|to allow Jews to sit in Parliament]]\u2014the oaths required of new members could only be made in good faith by a Christian. Disraeli had a bill passed through the Commons allowing each house of Parliament to determine what oaths its members should take. This was grudgingly agreed to by the House of Lords, with a minority of Conservatives joining with the opposition to pass it. In 1858, Baron Lionel de Rothschild became the first MP to profess the Jewish faith.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 371\u2013373</ref>\n\nFaced with a vacancy,{{refn|[[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], the [[President of the Board of Control]], had resigned amid a political crisis about his supervision of the governing of India.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 380\u2013382</ref>|group= n}} Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring Gladstone, still nominally a Conservative MP, into the government, hoping to strengthen it. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: \"Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this.\"<ref>Aldous, p. 106</ref> In responding to Disraeli, Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decisions then and previously whether to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby \"broader than you may have supposed\".<ref>Aldous, pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nThe Tories pursued a Reform Bill in 1859, which would have resulted in a modest increase to the franchise. The Liberals were healing the breaches between those who favoured Russell and the Palmerston loyalists, and in late March 1859, the government was defeated on a Russell-sponsored amendment. Derby dissolved Parliament, and the [[United Kingdom general election, 1859|ensuing general election]] resulted in modest Tory gains, but not enough to control the Commons. When Parliament assembled, Derby's government was defeated by 13 votes on an amendment to the [[speech from the throne|Address from the Throne]]. He resigned, and the Queen reluctantly sent for Palmerston again.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 401\u2013408</ref>\n\n===Opposition and third term as Chancellor===\n[[File:Portrait of Lord Beaconsfield (4672745).jpg|thumb|upright|Photograph of Benjamin Disraeli c.1860]]\n{{Main|Third Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry}}\nAfter Derby's second ejection from office, Disraeli faced dissension within Conservative ranks from those who blamed him for the defeat, or who felt he was disloyal to Derby\u2014the former Prime Minister warned Disraeli of some MPs seeking his removal from the front bench.<ref name = \"b426\">Blake (1967), p. 426</ref> Among the conspirators were [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Robert Cecil]], a young Conservative MP who would a quarter century later become Prime Minister as Lord Salisbury; he wrote that having Disraeli as leader in the Commons decreased the Conservatives' chance of holding office.

When the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, Disraeli said little publicly, but [[United Kingdom and the American Civil War|like most Englishmen]] expected the South to win.  Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements in support of the South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 429</ref> In 1862, Disraeli met Prussian Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] for the first time and said of him, \"be careful about that man, he means what he says\".<ref>Weintraub, p. 395</ref>\n\nThe party truce ended in 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's handling of the territorial dispute between the [[German Confederation]] and Denmark known as the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]]. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18\u2014Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office.<ref>Weintraub, p. 405</ref> Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|July 1865 general election]]. In the wake of the poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.<ref>Weintraub, p. 411</ref>\n\nPolitical plans were thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early priorities was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the [[Adullamites|dissident Liberals]] repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents were unwilling to serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 436\u2013445</ref> In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without a majority in the Commons, the Conservatives had little choice but to accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.<ref>Aldous, pp. 174, 179, 182\u2013184</ref>\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1867]] passed that August,<ref>Kirsch, p. 184</ref> extending the franchise by 938,427\u2014an increase of 88%\u2014by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least \u00a310 for rooms. It eliminated [[rotten borough]]s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granted constituencies to 15 unrepresented towns, with extra representation to large municipalities such as Liverpool and Manchester.<ref>Conacher (1971), p. 179</ref> This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]] (as Robert Cecil was by then known), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of \"a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals\".<ref>Blake (1967), p. 473</ref> Cranborne, however, was unable to lead an effective rebellion against Derby and Disraeli.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 461.</ref> Disraeli gained wide acclaim and became a hero to his party for the \"marvellous parliamentary skill\" with which he secured the passage of Reform in the Commons.<ref>Hibbert, p. 259</ref>\n\nDerby had long suffered from attacks of [[gout]] which sent him to his bed, unable to deal with politics. As the new session of Parliament approached in February 1868, he was bedridden at his home, [[Knowsley Hall]], near Liverpool. He was reluctant to resign, reasoning that he was only 68, much younger than either Palmerston or Russell at the end of their premierships; yet he knew that his \"attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties\", and doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation from office.<ref>Aldous, pp. 187\u2013188</ref> In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that \"you will not shrink from the additional heavy responsibility\".<ref name = \"a188\">Aldous, p. 188</ref> Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as \"only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues\".<ref name =\"a188\" /> Disraeli went to [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], where the Queen asked him to form a government. The monarch wrote to her daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Prussian Crown Princess Victoria]], \"Mr. Disraeli is Prime Minister! A proud thing for a man 'risen from the people' to have obtained!\"<ref name = \"a188\" /> The new Prime Minister told those who came to congratulate him, \"I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.\"<ref>Aldous, p. 189</ref>\n\n==First term as Prime Minister; opposition leader==\n{{Main|First premiership of Benjamin Disraeli|First Disraeli ministry}}\n\n===First government (February\u2013December 1868)===\n{{Further|Irish issue in British politics}}\n[[File:Chelmsford-Cairns-Hunt-Manning.jpg|thumb|Clockwise from top left: [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Cairns]], [[George Ward Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Henry Edward Manning|Manning]]|alt=Four men, the second of whom wears a wig resembling that of a judge, and the fourth of whom wears clerical clothes]]\nThe Conservatives remained a minority in the House of Commons and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] with [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Lord Cairns]], and brought in [[George Ward Hunt]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling to wait, and Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 487\u2013489</ref>\n\nDisraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the [[Church of Ireland]]. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the [[established church]] and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with [[Henry Edward Manning|Archbishop Manning]] the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in [[Dublin]] foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 496\u2013499</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives remained in office because the new electoral register was not yet ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll. Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation. Disraeli's government survived until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|December general election]], at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 496\u2013512</ref>\n\nDespite its short life, the first Disraeli government succeeded in passing a number of pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the [[Corrupt Practices Act 1868|Corrupt Practices Act]] did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised an early version of [[nationalisation]], having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 495</ref> Disraeli sent the successful [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|expedition]] against [[Tewodros II]] of Ethiopia under [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Sir Robert Napier]].<ref>Weintraub, pp. 470\u2013471</ref>\n\n===Opposition leader; 1874 election===\n[[File:Benjamin Disraeli by H Lenthall.jpg|thumb|right|Disraeli circa 1870]]\nWith Gladstone's Liberal majority dominant in the Commons, Disraeli could do little but protest as the government advanced legislation. Accordingly, he chose to await Liberal mistakes. Having leisure time as he was not in office, he wrote a new novel, ''[[Lothair (novel)|Lothair]]'' (1870). A work of fiction by a former Prime Minister was a new thing for Britain, and the book became a bestseller.<ref>Aldous, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\nBy 1872, there was dissent in the Conservative ranks over the failure to challenge Gladstone and his Liberals. This was quieted as Disraeli took steps to assert his leadership of the party, and as divisions among the Liberals became clear.  Public support for Disraeli was shown by cheering at a thanksgiving service that year on the recovery of [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]] from illness, while Gladstone was met with silence. Disraeli had supported the efforts of party manager [[John Eldon Gorst]] to put the administration of the Conservative Party on a modern basis. On Gorst's advice, Disraeli gave a speech to a mass meeting in Manchester that year. To roaring approval, he compared the Liberal front bench to \"a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes and ever and again the dark rumbling of the sea.\"<ref>Aldous, pp. 219\u2013223</ref> Gladstone, Disraeli stated, dominated the scene and \"alternated between a menace and a sigh\".<ref>Aldous, p. 223</ref>\n\nAt his first departure from [[10 Downing Street]] in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield in her own right in lieu of a peerage for himself.<ref name=\"Hibbertpp\">Hibbert, pp. 279\u2013280</ref> Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer.

This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor,{{refn|Gladstone caused great surprise by this move; he transferred the incumbent Chancellor, Robert Lowe, to the Home Office. [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] left the cabinet, making way as [[Lord President of the Council]] for [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]], moved from the Home Office.<ref>\"Changes in the Ministry\", ''The Times'', 8 August 1873, p. 7</ref>|group= n}} leading to questions as to whether he had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry\u2014until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 527\u2013529</ref>\n\nIn January 1874, Gladstone called a general election, convinced that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February.<ref>Weintraub, p. 517</ref> Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme of the past five years. As the constituencies voted, it became clear that the result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish [[Home Rule League]]. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 537\u2013538</ref>\n\n==Second government (1874\u201380)==\n{{Main|Second premiership of Benjamin Disraeli|Second Disraeli ministry}}\n[[File:Derby-Northcote.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|[[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Derby]] (top) and [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Northcote]]|alt=Two gentlemen; the second has an impressive beard]]\n\nDisraeli's cabinet of twelve, with six peers and six commoners, was the smallest since [[Reform Act 1832|Reform]]. Of the peers, five of them had been in Disraeli's 1868 cabinet; the sixth, Lord Salisbury, was reconciled to Disraeli after negotiation and became [[Secretary of State for India]]. Lord Stanley (who had succeeded his father, the former Prime Minister, as Earl of Derby) became Foreign Secretary and [[Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh|Sir Stafford Northcote]] the Chancellor.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 489, 538\u2013540</ref>\n\nIn August 1876, Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords as [[Earl of Beaconsfield]] and Viscount Hughenden. The Queen had offered to ennoble him as early as 1868; he had then declined. She did so again in 1874, when he fell ill at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]], but he was reluctant to leave the Commons for a house in which he had no experience.  Continued ill-health during his second premiership caused him to contemplate resignation, but his lieutenant, Derby, was unwilling, feeling that he could not manage the Queen. For Disraeli, the Lords, where the debate was less intense, was the alternative to resignation from office. Five days before the end of the 1876 session of Parliament, on 11 August, Disraeli was seen to linger and look around the chamber before departing the Commons. Newspapers reported his ennoblement the following morning.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 558\u2013560</ref>\n\nThe earldom of Beaconsfield was to have been bestowed on [[Edmund Burke]] in 1797, but he had died before receiving it.<ref>Weintraub, p. 560</ref> The name [[Beaconsfield]], a town near Hughenden, also was given to a minor character in ''Vivian Grey''.<ref>Kirsch, p. 212</ref> Disraeli made various statements about his elevation, writing to Selina, Lady Bradford on 8 August 1876, \"I am quite tired of that place [the Commons]\"<ref>Weintraub, p. 561</ref> but when asked by a friend how he liked the Lords, replied, \"I am dead; dead but in the Elysian fields.\"<ref>Blake (1967), p. 569</ref>\n\n===Domestic policy===\n\n====Reforming legislation====\nUnder the stewardship of [[Richard Assheton Cross]], the [[Home Secretary]], Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the [[Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]],<ref name = \"mb709\" /> which made inexpensive loans available to towns and cities to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the [[Public Health Act 1875]], modernising sanitary codes through the nation,<ref name = \"w530\">Weintraub, p. 530</ref> the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).<ref name = \"mb709\"  />\n\nDisraeli's government also introduced a new [[Factory Act]] meant to protect workers, the [[Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875]], which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Liberal-Labour]] MP [[Alexander Macdonald (Lib\u2013Lab politician)|Alexander Macdonald]] told his constituents in 1879, \"The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty.\"<ref name = \"mb709\">Monypenny and Buckle, p. 709</ref>\n\n====Patronage and Civil Service reform====\n[[File:Samuel Wilberforce by Mowbray of Oxford.jpg|thumb|upright|Disraeli's failure to appoint [[Samuel Wilberforce]] as [[Bishop of London]] may have cost him votes in the 1868 election.]]\nGladstone in 1870 had sponsored an [[Order in Council]], introducing [[competitive examination]] into [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|the Civil Service]], diminishing the political aspects of government hiring. Disraeli did not agree, and while he did not seek to reverse the order, his actions often frustrated its intent.  For example, Disraeli made political appointments to positions previously given to career civil servants. In this, he was backed by his party, hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government. Disraeli gave positions to hard-up Conservative leaders, even\u2014to Gladstone's outrage\u2014creating one office at \u00a32,000 per year.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 682\u2013685</ref> Nevertheless, Disraeli made fewer peers (only 22, and one of those one of Victoria's sons) than had Gladstone\u2014the Liberal leader had arranged for the bestowal of 37 peerages during his just over five years in office.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 687</ref>\n\nAs he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making [[Sydney Turner]], son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, [[Dean of Ripon]].<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 686\u2013687</ref> He favoured [[Low church]] clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons. In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort]], preferred [[Broad church]] teachings. One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1868|1868 election]]. When the position of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, [[Archibald Tait]], the [[Bishop of London]]. To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the former [[Bishop of Winchester]] and leading figure in London society. Disraeli disliked Wilberforce, and instead appointed [[John Jackson (bishop)|John Jackson]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 509\u2013511</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nDisraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830\u20131831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe.  His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.<ref name=\"Blake (1967), pp. 570\u2013571\">Blake (1967), pp. 570\u2013571</ref>\n\n====Suez====\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright|''New Crowns for Old'' depicts Disraeli as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] ''[[Aladdin]]'', offering Victoria an imperial crown in exchange for a royal one. Disraeli cultivated a public image of himself as an Imperialist with grand gestures such as conferring on Queen Victoria the title \"Empress of India\".|alt=See caption]]\n\nThe [[Suez Canal]], opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 581</ref> In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial.  Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, though some of the stock belonged to [[Isma'il Pasha]], the [[Khedive of Egypt]], who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention.<ref name=\"Blake (1967), pp. 570\u2013571\"/> The Khedive governed Egypt under the [[Ottoman Empire]]; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the [[Eastern Question]] of what to do about the decaying empire governed from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].<ref name = \"w541\">Weintraub, p. 541</ref> With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria.<ref>Roberts, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.<ref>Aldous, p. 262</ref>\n\nDisraeli had passed near Suez in his tour of the Middle East in his youth, and on taking office, recognising the British interest in the canal as a gateway to India, he sent the Liberal MP [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]] to Paris to enquire about buying de Lesseps's shares.<ref name = \"w541\" /> On 14 November 1875, the editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[Frederick Greenwood]], learned from London banker Henry Oppenheim that the Khedive was seeking to sell his shares in the [[Suez Canal Company]] to a French firm. Greenwood quickly told Lord Derby, the Foreign Secretary, who notified Disraeli. The Prime Minister moved immediately to secure the shares. On 23 November, the Khedive offered to sell the shares for 100,000,000 [[French franc|francs]].<ref name=baer>[[Werner Baer|Baer, Werner]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111714 \"The Promoting and the Financing of the Suez Canal\"], ''The Business History Review'', December 1956, p. 379 {{subscription}}</ref> Rather than seek the aid of the [[Bank of England]], Disraeli asked Lionel de Rothschild to loan funds. Rothschild did so, and controversially took a commission on the deal. The banker's capital was at risk, for Parliament could have refused to ratify the transaction.<ref>Aldous, pp. 262\u2013263</ref> The contract for purchase was signed at Cairo on 25 November, and the shares deposited at the British consulate the following day.<ref name = baer/>\n\nDisraeli told the Queen, \"it is settled; you have it, madam!\"<ref name =\"a263\">Aldous, p.&nbsp;263</ref> The public saw the venture as a daring British statement of its dominance of the seas.<ref name = \"a263\" /> [[Ian Malcolm (politician)|Sir Ian Malcolm]] described the Suez Canal share purchase as \"the greatest romance of Mr. Disraeli's romantic career\".<ref name = baer/> In the following decades, the security of the Suez Canal, as the pathway to India, became a major focus of British foreign policy. A later Foreign Secretary, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], described the canal in 1909 as \"the determining influence of every considerable movement of British power to the east and south of the Mediterranean\".<ref name = \"a263\" />\n\n====Royal Titles Act====\nAlthough initially curious about Disraeli when he entered Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. He told [[Matthew Arnold]], \"Everybody likes flattery; and, when you come to royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel\".<ref>Kirsch, pp. 202, 205</ref> Disraeli's biographer, [[Adam Kirsch]], suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch.<ref>Kirsch, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, [[Lord Melbourne]]. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to [[kiss hands]], he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, \"for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage.\"<ref>Aldous, pp. 246\u2013247</ref>\n\nVictoria had long wished to have an imperial title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain.<ref>Weintraub, p. 548</ref>  She was irked when Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when [[Frederick III, German Emperor|her husband]] came to the throne.<ref>Aldous, pp. 263\u2013264</ref> She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world.<ref>Weintraub, p. 549</ref> The title \"[[Empress of India]]\" had been used informally with respect to Victoria for some time and she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her. The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to [[State Opening of Parliament|open Parliament]] in person, which during this time she did only when she wanted something from legislators. Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the [[Queen's Speech]].<ref>Weintraub, p. 551</ref>\n\nOnce the desired bill was prepared, Disraeli's handling of it was not adept. He neglected to notify either the Prince of Wales or the opposition, and was met by irritation from the prince and a full-scale attack from the Liberals. An old enemy of Disraeli, former Liberal Chancellor [[Robert Lowe]], alleged during the debate in the Commons that two previous Prime Ministers had refused to introduce such legislation for the Queen. Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal. According to Blake, Disraeli \"in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe\", who apologised and never held office again.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 563\u2013564</ref> Disraeli said of Lowe that he was the only person in London with whom he would not shake hands and, \"he is in the mud and there I leave him.\"<ref>Blake (1967), p. 564</ref>\n\nFearful of losing, Disraeli was reluctant to bring the bill to a vote in the Commons, but when he eventually did, it passed with a majority of 75. Once the bill was formally enacted, Victoria began signing her letters \"Victoria R & I\" (''Regina et Imperatrix'', that is, Queen and Empress).<ref>Weintraub, p. 553</ref> According to Aldous, \"the unpopular [[Royal Titles Act 1876|Royal Titles Act]], however, shattered Disraeli's authority in the House of Commons\".<ref>Aldous, p. 265</ref>\n\n====Balkans and Bulgaria====\n[[File:Fight near Telish 1877.jpg|thumb|Fight in Bulgaria during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]]]\nIn July 1875, Serb populations in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], then provinces of the Ottoman Empire, rose [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)|in revolt]] against their Turkish masters, alleging religious persecution and poor administration. The following January, Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] agreed to reforms proposed by Hungarian statesman [[Julius Andr\u00e1ssy]], but the rebels, suspecting they might win their freedom, continued their uprising, joined by militants in Serbia [[April Uprising|and Bulgaria]]. The Turks suppressed the Bulgarian uprising harshly, and when reports of these actions escaped, Disraeli and Derby stated in Parliament that they did not believe them. Disraeli called them \"coffee-house babble\" and dismissed allegations of torture by the Ottomans since \"Oriental people usually terminate their connections with culprits in a more expeditious fashion\".<ref>Roberts, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nGladstone, who had left the Liberal leadership and retired from public life, was appalled by reports of [[Batak massacre|atrocities in Bulgaria]], and in August 1876, penned a hastily written pamphlet arguing that the Turks should be deprived of Bulgaria because of what they had done there. He sent a copy to Disraeli, who called it \"vindictive and ill-written&nbsp;... of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest\".<ref>Jenkins, pp. 399\u2013403</ref> Gladstone's pamphlet became an immense best-seller and rallied the Liberals to urge that the Ottoman Empire should no longer be a British ally. Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, \"Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe. Now we are obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy.\"<ref>Roberts, pp. 151\u2013152</ref> In spite of this, Disraeli's policy favoured Constantinople and the territorial integrity of its empire.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 607</ref>\n\n[[File:Constantinople-conference.jpg|thumb|upright|International delegates at the Constantinople Conference: clockwise from top left, [[Saffet Pasha]] (Turkey), [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev|General Ignatieff]] (Russia), Lord Salisbury (Britain) and the Comte de Chaudordy (France)|alt=Four men]]\n\nDisraeli and the cabinet sent Salisbury as lead British representative to the [[Constantinople Conference]], which met in December 1876 and January 1877.<ref name = \"j409\">Jenkins, p. 409</ref> In advance of the conference, Disraeli sent Salisbury private word to seek British military occupation of Bulgaria and Bosnia, and British control of the [[Ottoman Army]]. Salisbury ignored these instructions, which his biographer, [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] deemed \"ludicrous\".<ref>Roberts, pp. 160\u2013161</ref> Nevertheless, the conference failed to reach agreement with the Turks.<ref>Weintraub, p. 571</ref>\n\nParliament opened in February 1877, with Disraeli now in the Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield. He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February that there was a need for stability in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions would do nothing to secure it. The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire. As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War]].<ref>Weintraub, pp. 576\u2013577</ref>\n\n====Congress of Berlin====\n{{main|Congress of Berlin}}\n\nThe Russians pushed through Ottoman territory, and by December 1877 had captured the strategic Bulgarian town of [[Pleven|Plevna]]; their march on Constantinople seemed inevitable. The war divided the British, but the Russian success caused some to forget the atrocities and call for intervention on the Turkish side. Others hoped for further Russian successes. The fall of Plevna was a major story for weeks in the newspapers, and Disraeli's warnings that Russia was a threat to British interests in the eastern Mediterranean were deemed prophetic. The [[jingoism|jingoistic]] attitude of many Britons increased Disraeli's political support, and the Queen acted to help him as well, showing her favour by visiting him at Hughenden\u2014the first time she had visited the country home of her Prime Minister since [[Second Melbourne ministry|the Melbourne ministry]]. At the end of January 1878, the Ottoman Sultan appealed to Britain to save Constantinople. Amid war fever in Britain, the government asked Parliament to vote \u00a36,000,000 to prepare the [[British Army|Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] for war. Gladstone, who had again involved himself in politics, opposed the measure, but less than half his party voted with him. Popular opinion was with Disraeli, though some thought him too soft for not immediately declaring war on Russia.<ref>Aldous, pp. 279\u2013284</ref>\n\n[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|thumb|Bulgaria as constituted under the San Stefano treaty and as divided at Berlin|alt=A map. See description]]\n\nWith the Russians close to Constantinople, the Turks yielded and signed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] in March 1878, [[Liberation of Bulgaria|conceding a Bulgarian state]] which would cover a large part of the Balkans. It was to be initially occupied by the Russians, and many feared that it would give them a [[client state]] close to Constantinople. Other Ottoman possessions in Europe would become independent; additional territory was to be ceded directly to Russia. This was unacceptable to the British, who protested, hoping to get the Russians to agree to attend an international conference which German Chancellor Bismarck proposed to hold at Berlin. The cabinet discussed Disraeli's proposal to position Indian troops at Malta for possible transit to the Balkans<ref>Roberts, pp. 185\u2013187</ref> and call out reserves. Derby resigned in protest, and Disraeli appointed Salisbury as Foreign Secretary. Amid British preparations for war, the Russians and Turks agreed to discussions at Berlin.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 588\u2013590</ref>\n\nIn advance of the meeting, confidential negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, [[Bessarabia]] in Europe and [[Batum]] and [[Kars]] on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]]. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of [[Cyprus]]. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 644\u2013645</ref>\n\n[[File:Pas-de-deux-disraeli-salisbury.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Disraeli (right) and Salisbury as Knights of the Garter, portrayed by [[John Tenniel]] in \"''The Pas de deux (From the Sc\u00e8ne de Triomphe in the Grand Anglo-Turkish Ballet d'Action)''\"|alt=See caption]]\n\nThe [[Congress of Berlin]] was held in June and July 1878, the central relationship in it that between Disraeli and Bismarck. In later years, the German chancellor would show visitors to his office three pictures on the wall: \"the portrait of my Sovereign, there on the right that of my wife, and on the left, there, that of Lord Beaconsfield\".<ref>Aldous, p. 284</ref> Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as the international language of diplomacy. By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Lord Odo Russell]], hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's very poor French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters.<ref name = \"b648\">Blake (1967), p. 648</ref>\n\nDisraeli left much of the detailed work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite.<ref name = \"b648\" /> Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the [[Cyprus Convention]] ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.<ref name = \"b649\">Blake (1967), p. 649</ref>\n\nDisraeli gained agreement that Turkey should retain enough of its European possessions to safeguard the [[Dardanelles]].  By one account, when met with Russian intransigence, Disraeli told his secretary to order a special train to return them home to begin the war. Although Russia yielded, Tsar Alexander II later described the congress as \"a European coalition against Russia, under Bismarck\".<ref>Weintraub, pp. 595\u2013596</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] was signed on 13 July 1878 at the [[Reich Chancellery|Radziwill Palace]] in Berlin.{{refn|For the first time, the title of Britain's lead signatory was given as \"Prime Minister\":<ref>Aldous, p. 285</ref> Disraeli signed as  \"First Lord of the Treasury and Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\".<ref>Chris Bryant, ''Parliament: The Biography (Volume II - Reform)'', Random House, 2014. p.45</ref>|group= n}} Disraeli and Salisbury returned home to heroes' receptions at Dover and in London.

Parliaments then sat for a seven-year term, and it was the custom not to go to the country until the sixth year unless forced to by events. Only four and a half years had passed since the last general election. Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited. This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli.  Blake, however, pointed out that results in local elections had been moving against the Conservatives, and doubted if Disraeli missed any great opportunity by waiting.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 655\u2013656</ref>\n\nAs successful invasions of India generally came through Afghanistan, the British had observed and sometimes intervened there since the 1830s, hoping to keep the Russians out. In 1878 the Russians sent a mission to Kabul; it was not rejected by the Afghans, as the British had hoped.  The British then proposed to send their own mission, insisting that the Russians be sent away.  The [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], concealed his plans to issue this ultimatum from Disraeli, and when the Prime Minister insisted he take no action, went ahead anyway. When the Afghans made no answer, the British advanced against them in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], and under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] easily defeated them. The British installed a new ruler, and left a mission and garrison in Kabul.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 658\u2013663</ref>\n\nBritish policy in South Africa was to encourage federation between the British-run [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], and the [[Boer]] republics, the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] (annexed by Britain in 1877) and the [[Orange Free State]]. The governor of Cape Colony, [[Bartle Frere|Sir Bartle Frere]], believing that the federation could not be accomplished until the native tribes acknowledged British rule, made demands on the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and their king, [[Cetewayo]], which they were certain to reject. As Zulu troops could not marry until they had washed their spears in blood, they were eager for combat. Frere did not send word to the cabinet of what he had done until the ultimatum was about to expire. Disraeli and the cabinet reluctantly backed him, and in early January 1879 resolved to send reinforcements.  Before they could arrive, on 22 January, a Zulu ''[[impi]]'', or army, moving with great speed and stealth, ambushed and destroyed a British encampment in South Africa in the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. Over a thousand British and colonial troops were killed. Word of the defeat did not reach London until 12 February.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 666\u2013672</ref> Disraeli wrote the next day, \"the terrible disaster has shaken me to the centre\".<ref>Aldous, p. 293</ref> He reprimanded Frere, but left him in charge, attracting fire from all sides.  Disraeli sent General [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]] as High Commissioner and Commander in Chief. Before Wolseley could arrive, Frere rushed to the Zulu capital, crushing Cetewayo at the [[Battle of Ulundi]] on 4 July 1879.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 671\u2013672</ref>\n\nOn 8 September 1879, [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Sir Louis Cavagnari]], in charge of the mission in Kabul, was killed with his entire staff by rebelling Afghan soldiers. Roberts undertook a successful punitive expedition against the Afghans over the next six weeks.<ref>Blake (1967), p. 675</ref>\n\n===1880 election===\n{{main|United Kingdom general election, 1880}}\n[[File:Disraeli.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Disraeli published in 1873]]\n\nGladstone, in the 1874 election, had been returned for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]], finishing second behind a Conservative in the two-member constituency, a result he termed more like a defeat than a victory. In December 1878, he was offered the Liberal nomination at the next election for [[Edinburghshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburghshire]], a constituency popularly known as Midlothian. The small Scottish electorate was dominated by two noblemen, the Conservative [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|Duke of Buccleuch]] and the Liberal [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. The Earl, a friend of both Disraeli and Gladstone who would succeed the latter after his final term as Prime Minister, had journeyed to the United States to view politics there, and was convinced that aspects of American electioneering could be translated to the United Kingdom. On his advice, Gladstone accepted the offer in January 1879, and later that year began his [[Midlothian campaign]], speaking not only in Edinburgh, but across Britain, attacking Disraeli, to huge crowds.<ref>Aldous, pp. 290\u2013295</ref>\n\nConservative chances of re-election were damaged by the poor weather, and consequent effects on agriculture. Four consecutive wet summers through 1879 had led to poor harvests in the United Kingdom. In the past, the farmer had the consolation of higher prices at such times, but with bumper crops cheaply transported from the United States, grain prices remained low. Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws. He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled. Protection would have been highly unpopular among the newly enfranchised urban working classes, as it would raise their cost of living. Amid an economic slump generally, the Conservatives lost support among farmers.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 697\u2013699</ref>\n\nDisraeli's health continued to fail through 1879. Owing to his infirmities, he was three-quarters of an hour late for the [[Lord Mayor of London#Role|Lord Mayor's Dinner]] at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in November, at which it is customary that the Prime Minister speaks. Though many commented on how healthy he looked, it took him great effort to appear so, and when he told the audience he expected to speak to the dinner again the following year, attendees chuckled\u2014Gladstone was then in the midst of his campaign. Despite his public confidence, Disraeli recognised that the Conservatives would probably lose the next election, and was already contemplating his [[Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]].<ref>Weintraub, pp. 616\u2013618</ref>\n\nDespite this pessimism, Conservative hopes were buoyed in early 1880 with successes in by-elections the Liberals had expected to win, concluding with victory in [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]], normally a Liberal stronghold. The cabinet had resolved to wait before dissolving Parliament; in early March they reconsidered, agreeing to go to the country as soon as possible.  Parliament was dissolved on 24 March, and the first borough constituencies began voting a week later.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 702\u2013707</ref>\n\nDisraeli took no public part in the electioneering, it being deemed improper for peers to make speeches to influence Commons elections.  This meant that the chief Conservatives\u2014Disraeli, Salisbury, and India Secretary [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook|Lord Cranbrook]]\u2014would not be heard from. The election was thought likely to be close.<ref>Aldous, p. 301</ref> Once returns began to be announced, it became clear that the Conservatives were being decisively beaten.

He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, [[Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton|Montagu Corry]], who became Baron Rowton.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 625\u2013626</ref>\n{{multiple image| align = right| direction = horizontal| header_align = center| footer_align = left| footer_background = | image1 = Disraelideathmask.jpg| width1 = 105 | caption1 = <center> Disraeli's [[death mask]]</center> | alt1= A death mask resembling Disraeli | image2 = The Primrose Tomb - geograph.org.uk - 154226.jpg | width2 = 134 | caption2 = <center> Disraeli's tomb at Hughenden</center> |alt2= A grave }}\n\nReturning to Hughenden, Disraeli brooded over his electoral dismissal, but also resumed work on ''[[Endymion (Disraeli novel)|Endymion]]'', which he had begun in 1872 and laid aside before the 1874 election. The work was rapidly completed and published by November 1880.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 627\u2013633</ref> He carried on a correspondence with Victoria, with letters passed through intermediaries.

In March, he fell ill with bronchitis, and emerged from bed only for a meeting with Salisbury and other Conservative leaders on the 26th. As it became clear that this might be his final sickness, friends and opponents alike came to call. Disraeli declined a visit from the Queen, saying, \"She would only ask me to take a message to Albert.\"<ref>Weintraub, pp. 654\u2013655</ref> Almost blind, when he received the last letter from Victoria of which he was aware on 5 April, he held it momentarily, then had it read to him by [[George Barrington, 7th Viscount Barrington|Lord Barrington]], a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]].

The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, \"May the Almighty be near his pillow.\"<ref>Weintraub, pp. 656\u2013657</ref> There was intense public interest in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life.

Queen Victoria was prostrated with grief, and considered ennobling Ralph or Coningsby as a memorial to Disraeli (without children, his titles became extinct with his death) but decided against it on the ground that their means were too small for a peerage. Protocol forbade her attending Disraeli's funeral (this would not be changed until 1965, when [[Elizabeth II]] attended the rites for the former Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]) but she sent [[Primrose Day|primroses]] (\"his favourite flowers\") to the funeral, and visited the burial vault to place a wreath of china blooms four days later.<ref>Weintraub, pp. 659\u2013662; and Blake (1967), pp. 749\u2013755</ref>  The [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Sir John A.

Gladstone had absented himself from the funeral, with his plea of the press of public business met with public mockery. His speech was widely anticipated, if only because his dislike for Disraeli was well known, and caused the Prime Minister much worry.

Stewart observed that there have always been two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels\u2014one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, \"It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no matter how much you deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one.\"<ref name=stewart/>\n\nDisraeli's early \"[[Fashionable novel|silver fork]]\" novels ''Vivian Grey'' (1826) and ''[[The Young Duke (Disraeli novel)|The Young Duke]]'' (1831) featured romanticised depictions of aristocratic life (despite his ignorance of it) with character sketches of well-known public figures lightly disguised.<ref name=gale>[http://www.enotes.com/benjamin-disraeli-essays/disraeli-benjamin \"Benjamin Disraeli 1804\u20131881\"], '' Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism'', eNotes, accessed 25 August 2013</ref> In some of his early fiction Disraeli also portrayed himself and what he felt to be his [[Byronic hero|Byronic dual nature]]: the poet and the man of action.<ref name=b53>Bradford, p. 53</ref> His most autobiographical novel was ''Contarini Fleming'' (1832), an avowedly serious work that did not sell well.<ref name=b53/> The critic William Kuhn suggests that Disraeli's fiction can be read as \"the memoirs he never wrote\", revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket\u2014particularly with regard to what Kuhn sees as the author's \"ambiguous sexuality\".<ref>Kuhn, pp. 5, 12 and 125</ref>\n\nOf the other novels of the early 1830s, ''Alroy'' is described by Blake as \"profitable but unreadable\".<ref>Blake (1967), p. 787</ref> ''The Rise of Iskander'' (1833), ''The Infernal Marriage'' and ''Ixion in Heaven'' (1834) made little impact.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 107\u2013108</ref> ''Henrietta Temple'' (1837) was Disraeli's next major success.<ref name=b143/> It draws on the events of his affair with Henrietta Sykes to tell the story of a debt-ridden young man torn between a mercenary loveless marriage and a passionate [[love at first sight]] for the eponymous heroine.<ref name=b143>Blake (1967), pp. 143\u2013144</ref> ''Venetia'' (1837) was a minor work, written to raise much-needed cash.<ref>Bradford, pp. 91\u201393</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s Disraeli wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With ''Coningsby; or, The New Generation'' (1844), Disraeli, in Blake's view, \"infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians.\"<ref name=gale/> ''Coningsby''  was followed by ''Sybil; or, The Two Nations'' (1845),<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels|title=The 100 best novels: No 11 \u2013 Sybil by Benjamin Disraeli (1845)|last=McCrum|first=Robert|date=2013-12-02|journal=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref> another [[political fiction|political novel]], which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than ''Coningsby''; the \"two nations\" of its sub-title referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived [[working class]]es.

The first, described by [[Daniel R. Schwarz|Daniel R Schwarz]] as 'Disraeli's ideological ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress|Pilgrim's Progress]]''',<ref>Schwarz, p. 128</ref> is a story of political life with particular regard to the roles of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. ''Endymion'', despite having a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as hero, is a last exposition of the author's economic policies and political beliefs.<ref>Bradford, pp. 287\u2013289 (''Lothair''); and 380\u2013383 (''Endymion'')</ref>\n\nTo the last, Disraeli pilloried his enemies in barely disguised caricatures.

Disraeli had, for example, stressed the need to improve the lot of the urban labourer. The memory of Disraeli was used by the Conservatives to appeal to the working classes, with whom he was said to have had a rapport.<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 523\u2013524</ref> This aspect of his policies has been re-evaluated by historians in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1972 B{{space}}H{{space}}Abbott stressed that it was not Disraeli but [[Lord Randolph Churchill]] who invented the term \"Tory democracy\", though it was Disraeli who made it an essential part of Conservative policy and philosophy.<ref>Abbott, pp. 17\u201318</ref> In 2007 Parry wrote, \"The tory democrat myth did not survive detailed scrutiny by professional historical writing of the 1960s [which] demonstrated that Disraeli had very little interest in a programme of social legislation and was very flexible in handling parliamentary reform in 1867.\"<ref>Parry,  p. 122</ref> Despite this, Parry sees Disraeli, rather than Peel, as the founder of the modern Conservative party.<ref>Parry, p. 123</ref> The Conservative politician and writer [[Douglas Hurd]] wrote in 2013, \"[Disraeli] was not a one-nation Conservative\u2014and this was not simply because he never used the phrase.

Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was the province of the Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent across the aisle. Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy. This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire. Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism \"decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else\".<ref>Blake (1967), pp. 760\u2013761</ref> Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, \"To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire.\"<ref>Abbott, p. 22</ref> Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies. Gladstone's biographer [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip Magnus]] contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who \"never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest.\"<ref>Magnus, p. 287</ref> In Parry's view, Disraeli's foreign policy \"can be seen as a gigantic castle in the air (as it was by Gladstone), or as an overdue attempt to force the British commercial classes to awaken to the realities of European politics.\"<ref>Parry,  p. 135</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime Disraeli's opponents, and sometimes even his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 at the time of Young England, wrote, \"could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?\"<ref name=smith>Smith, Paul.

Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his own party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.<ref>[http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routbrithistory/disraeli_benjamin_ist_earl_of_beaconsfield_1804_1881 \"Disraeli, Benjamin, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield 1804\u20131881\"] 2003, in ''Reader's Guide to British History'', Routledge, Credo Reference, accessed 26 August 2013</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorical writers have often played Disraeli and Gladstone against each other as great rivals.<ref>Dick Leonard, ''The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli'' (2013) is popular, while Richard Aldous, ''The Lion and The Unicorn: Gladstone and Disraeli'' (2007) is scholarly.

The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular [[binomial test]] of [[statistical significance]].\n\nThe binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size ''n'' drawn [[Sampling (statistics)#Replacement of selected units|with replacement]] from a population of size ''N.'' If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a [[hypergeometric distribution]], not a binomial one.  However, for ''N'' much larger than ''n'', the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.\n\n==Specification==\n\n===Probability mass function===\n\nIn general, if the random variable ''X'' follows the binomial distribution with parameters ''n'' \u2208 \u2115 and ''p'' \u2208 [0,1], we write ''X''&nbsp;~&nbsp;B(''n'',&nbsp;''p''). The probability of getting exactly ''k'' successes in ''n'' trials is given by the [[probability mass function]]:\n\n:<math>f(k,n,p) = \\Pr(k;n,p) = \\Pr(X = k) = {n\\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}</math>\n\nfor ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''n'', where\n\n:<math>\\binom n k =\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</math>\n\nis the [[binomial coefficient]], hence the name of the distribution. The formula can be understood as follows. ''k'' successes occur with probability ''p''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k'' failures occur with probability (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'')<sup>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k''</sup>. However, the ''k'' successes can occur anywhere among the ''n'' trials, and there are  <math>{n\\choose k}</math> different ways of distributing ''k'' successes in a sequence of ''n'' trials.\n\nIn creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually the table is filled in up to ''n''/2 values. This is because for ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''n''/2, the probability can be calculated by its complement as\n\n:<math>f(k,n,p)=f(n-k,n,1-p). </math>\n\nLooking at the expression ''\u0192''(''k'',&nbsp;''n'',&nbsp;''p'') as a function of ''k'', there is a ''k'' value that maximizes it. This ''k'' value can be found by calculating\n:<math> \\frac{f(k+1,n,p)}{f(k,n,p)}=\\frac{(n-k)p}{(k+1)(1-p)} </math>\nand comparing it to 1. There is always an integer ''M'' that satisfies\n\n:<math>(n+1)p-1 \\leq M < (n+1)p.</math>\n\n''\u0192''(''k'',&nbsp;''n'',&nbsp;''p'') is monotone increasing for ''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''M'' and monotone decreasing for ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''M'', with the exception of the case where (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)''p'' is an integer. In this case, there are two values for which ''\u0192'' is maximal: (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)''p'' and (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1. ''M'' is the ''most probable'' (''most likely'') outcome of the Bernoulli trials and is called the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]. Note that the probability of it occurring can be fairly small.\n\n===Cumulative distribution function===\n\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] can be expressed as:\n\n:<math>F(k;n,p) = \\Pr(X \\le k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor} {n\\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle \\lfloor k\\rfloor\\,</math> is the \"floor\" under ''k'', i.e. the [[greatest integer]] less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nIt can also be represented in terms of the [[regularized incomplete beta function]], as follows:<ref>{{cite book |last=Wadsworth |first=G.

Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]] since B(''n'',&nbsp;''p'') is a sum of ''n'' independent, identically distributed [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli variables]] with parameter&nbsp;''p''.

Therefore, the Poisson distribution with parameter ''\u03bb'' = ''np'' can be used as an approximation to B(''n'', ''p'') of the binomial distribution if ''n'' is sufficiently large and ''p'' is sufficiently small.  According to two rules of thumb, this approximation is good if ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;20 and ''p''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0.05, or if ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;100 and ''np''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;10.<ref name=\"nist\">[[NIST]]/[[SEMATECH]], [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc331.htm \"6.3.3.1.

To do so, one must calculate the probability that P(X=k) for all values ''k'' from 0 through ''n''. (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to generate samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples U[0,1] into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in step one.\n\n==Tail bounds==\nFor ''k'' \u2264 ''np'', [[Chernoff bound|upper bounds]] for the lower tail of the distribution function can be derived.

[[Genetics]] studies, since its beginning, used statistical concepts to understand observed experimental results. Some genetics scientists even contributed with statistical advances with the development of methods and tools. [[Gregor Mendel]] started the genetics studies investigating genetics segregation patterns in families of peas and used statistics to explain the collected data. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Mendel's Mendelian inheritance work, there were gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism. [[Francis Galton]] tried to expand Mendel\u2019s discoveries with human data and proposed a different model with fractions of the heredity coming from each ancestral composing a infinite series. He called this theory of \u201c [[Francis Galton|Law of Ancestral Heredity]]\u201d. His ideas were strong disagreed by [[William Bateson]], who follow Mendel\u2019s conclusions, that genetic inheritance were exclusively from the parents, half from each of them.  This led to a vigorous debate between the ones called biometricians, who support Galton ideas, as [[Walter Weldon]], [[Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire]] and [[Karl Pearson]], and Mendelians, who support Bateson (and Mendel) ideas, such as [[Charles Davenport]], and [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]. Later, biometricians could not reproduce Galton conclusions in different experiments, and Mendel\u2019s ideas prevailed. By the 1930s, models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis.\n\nSolving these differences also allowed to define the concept of population genetics and brought together genetics and evolution. The three leading figures in the establishment of [[population genetics]] and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.\n* [[Ronald Fisher]] developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work studying the crop experiments at [[Rothamsted Research]], including in his books [[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]] (1925) end [[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]] (1930). He gave many contributions to genetics and statistics. Some of them include the [[ANOVA]], [[p-value]] concepts, [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher\u2019s exact test]] and [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher\u2019s equation]] for [[population dynamics]]. He is credited for the sentence \u201cNatural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=Chris |title=Quantitative Genetics|journal=Nature|date=10 December 2008|volume=456|pages=719|doi=10.1038/456719a|bibcode=2008Natur.456..719G}}</ref>\n* [[Sewall G. Wright]] developed [[F-statistics]] and methods of computing them and defined [[inbreeding coefficient]].\n* [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s book, ''The Causes of Evolution'', reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics. Also developed the theory of [[primordial soup]].\n\nThese and other biostatisticians, [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologists]], and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together [[evolutionary biology]] and [[genetics]] into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be [[Statistics|quantitative]]ly modeled.\n\nIn parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in ''On Growth and Form'' also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.\n\nDespite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] apparent. One anecdote describes [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] banning the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden calculator]] from his department at [[Caltech]], saying \"Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in [[placer mining]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf|title=Academic Economics: Strengths and Faults After Considering Interdisciplinary Needs|author=Charles T. Munger|date=2003-10-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Biostatistics and Medicine ===\n\nStatistical concepts also are present in [[clinical trials]] and [[epidemiological studies]]. These fields have their own history of biostatistics developments. In the 18th century, statistical methods were used to decide whether the application of certain treatments were effective, such as the insertion of [[smallpox]] pustules under an individual\u2019s skin in the hope of creating a mild case of the disease that would induce later immunity. Since this actually put patients at risk of contracting a potentially fatal form of the disease, this treatment became the subject of much controversy. [[John Arbuthnot]] in 1722 studied the chances of people dying by naturally-occurring smallpox as compared to inoculation-induced smallpox. On the basis of the statistical studies, it was concluded that inoculation was preferred. Later, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[Jean d\u2019Alembert]] developed more robust statistical methods for the same problem, both based on the proportion of people who died.<ref name=\"Matthews\">{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1= J.Rosser |title=History of Biostatistics|journal=Encyclopedia of Biostatistics|date=5 July 2005|doi=10.1002/0470011815.b2a17065}}</ref>\n \n[[James Lind]] were the first to propose groups of test of hypotheses. He applied this method to solve an outbreak of scurvy. For this, he is considered the \u201cfather\u201d of clinical trial. In 1835, [[Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis]] proposed the \u201cnumerical method\u201d to argue\nthat the practice of bloodletting was actually doing more harm than good for the patients.  In 1840, [[Louis Denis Jules Gavarret]] publish the [[Louis Denis Jules Gavarret|Principes G\u00e9n\u00e9raux de Statistique M\u00e9dicale]] in which he pointed out that Louis\u2019s averages could vary between what he called \u201climits of oscillation\u201d (or [[confidence interval]]) if multiple samples were taken from the same population. Karl Pearson also expanded his methods to medicine, despite his main goal was to explicit the statistical implications of Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection.<ref name=\"Matthews\" />\n\n== Research planning ==\n\nAny research in [[life sciences]] is proposed to answer a [[scientific question]] we might have. To answer this question with a high certainty, we need [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] results. The correct definition of the main [[hypothesis]] and the research plan will reduce errors while taking a decision in understanding a phenomenon. The research plan might include the research question, the hypothesis to be tested, the [[experimental design]], [[data collection]] methods, [[data analysis]] perspectives and costs evolved. It is essential to carry the study based on the three basic principles of experimental statistics: [[randomization]], [[Replication (statistics)|replication]], and local control.\n\n=== Research question ===\n\nThe research question will define the objective of a study. The research will be headed by the question, so it needs to be concise, at the same time it is focused on interesting and novel topics that may improve science and knowledge and that field. To define the way to ask the [[scientific question]], an exhaustive [[literature review]] might be necessary. So, the research can be useful to add value to the [[scientific community]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Nizamuddin|first1=Sarah L.|last2=Nizamuddin|first2=Junaid|last3=Mueller|first3=Ariel|last4=Ramakrishna|first4=Harish|last5=Shahul|first5=Sajid S.|title=Developing a Hypothesis and Statistical Planning|journal=Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia|date=October 2017|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1878\u20131882|doi=10.1053/j.jvca.2017.04.020}}</ref>\n\n=== Hypothesis definition ===\n\nOnce the aim of the study is defined, the possible answers to the research question can be proposed, transforming this question into a [[hypothesis]]. The main propose is called [[null hypothesis]] (H<sub>0</sub>) and is usually based on a permanent knowledge about the topic or an obvious occurrence of the phenomena, sustained by a deep literature review. We can say it is the standard expected answer for the data under the situation in [[Experiment|test]]. In general, H<sub>O</sub> assumes no association between <sub>treatments</sub>. On the other hand, the [[alternative hypothesis]] is the denial of H<sub>O</sub>. It assumes some degree of association between the treatment and the outcome. Although, the hypothesis is sustained by question research and its expected and unexpected answers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAs an example, consider groups of similar animals (mice, for example) under two different diet systems. The research question would be: what is the best diet? In this case, H<sub>0</sub> would be that there is no difference between the two diets in mice [[metabolism]] (H<sub>0</sub>: \u03bc<sub>1</sub> = \u03bc<sub>2</sub>) and the [[alternative hypothesis]] would be that the diets have different effects over animals metabolism (H<sub>1</sub>: \u03bc<sub>1</sub> \u2260 \u03bc<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe [[hypothesis]] is defined by the researcher, according to his/her interests in answering the main question. Besides that, the [[alternative hypothesis]] can be more than one hypothesis. It can assume not only differences across observed parameters, but their degree of differences (''i.e.'' higher or shorter).\n\n=== Sampling ===\n\nUsually, a study aims to understand an effect of a phenomenon over a [[population]]. In [[biology]], a [[population]] is defined as all the [[individuals]] of a given [[species]], in a specific area at a given time. In biostatistics, this concept is extended to a variety of collections possible of study. Although, in biostatistics, a [[population]] is not only the [[individuals]], but the total of one specific component of their [[organisms]], as the whole [[genome]], or all the sperm [[cells]], for animals, or the total leaf area, for a plant, for example.\n\nIt is not possible to take the [[Measurement|measures]] from all the elements of a [[population]]. Because of that, the [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] process is very important for [[statistical inference]]. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is defined as to randomly get a representative part of the entire population, to make posterior inferences about the population. So, the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] might catch the most [[Statistical variability|variability]] across a population.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal| doi= 10.1177/0115426507022006629| pmid= 18042950| title= Biostatistics Primer: Part I| journal= Nutrition in Clinical Practice| volume= 22| issue= 6| pages= 629| year= 2017| last1= Overholser| first1= Brian R| last2= Sowinski| first2= Kevin M}}</ref> The [[sample size]] is determined by several things, since the scope of the research to the resources available.

There are three basic experimental designs to randomly allocate [[treatment group|treatments]] in all [[Quadrat|plots]] of the [[experiment]]. They are [[completely randomized design]], [[randomized block design]], and [[factorial designs]]. Treatments can be arranged in many ways inside the experiment. In [[agriculture]], the correct [[experimental design]] is the root of a good study and the arrangement of [[treatment group|treatments]] within the study is essential because [[environment (systems)|environment]] largely affects the [[Quadrat|plots]] ([[plants]], [[livestock]], [[microorganisms]]).

[[Outlier]]s may be plotted as circles.\n\n* '''Correlation Coefficients'''\n\nAlthough correlations between two different kinds of data could be inferred by graphs, such as scatter plot, is necessary validate this though numerical information.

In other words, it is desirable to obtain parameters to describe the population of interest, but since the data is limited, it is necessary to make use of a representative sample in order to estimate them. With that, it is possible to test previously defined hypotheses and apply the conclusions to the entire population. The [[Standard error| standard error of the mean]] is a measure of variability that is crucial to do inferences.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n* [[Statistical hypothesis testing|Hypothesis testing]]\n\nHypothesis testing is essential to make inferences about populations aiming to answer research questions, as settled in \"Research planning\" section. Authors defined four steps to be set:<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n# ''The hypothesis to be tested'': as stated earlier, we have to work with the definition of a [[null hypothesis]] (H<sub>0</sub>), that is going to be tested, and an [[alternative hypothesis]]. But they must be defined before the experiment implementation. \n# ''Significance level and decision rule'': A decision rule depends on the [[significance level|level of significance]], or in other words, the acceptable error rate (\u03b1). It is easier to think that we define a ''critical value'' that determines the statistical significance when a [[test statistic]] is compared with it. So, \u03b1 also has to be predefined before the experiment.\n# ''Experiment and statistical analysis'': This is when the experiment is really implemented following the appropriate [[Design of experiments|experimental design]], data is collected and the more suitable statistical tests are evaluated.\n# ''Inference'': Is made when the [[null hypothesis]] is rejected or not rejected, based on the evidence that the comparison of [[p-value]]s and \u03b1 brings. It is pointed that the failure to reject H<sub>0</sub> just means that there is not enough evidence to support its rejection, but not that this hypothesis is true.\n\n* [[Confidence intervals]]\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values that can contain the true real parameter value in given a certain level of confidence. The first step is to estimate the best-unbiased estimate of the population parameter. The upper value of the interval is obtained by the sum of this estimate with the multiplication between the standard error of the mean and the confidence level. The calculation of lower value is similar, but instead of a sum, a subtraction must be applied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Statistical considerations ==\n\n=== Power and statistical error ===\n\nWhen testing a hypothesis, there are two types of statistic errors possible: [[Type I error]] and [[Type II error]]. The type I error or [[False positives and false negatives|false positive]] is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis and the type II error or [[False positives and false negatives|false negative]] is the failure to reject a false [[null hypothesis]]. The [[significance level]] denoted by \u03b1 is the type I error rate and should be chosen before performing the test. The type II error rate is denoted by \u03b2 and [[Statistical power|statistical power of the test]] is 1 \u2212 \u03b2.\n\n=== p-value ===\n\nThe [[p-value]] is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as or more extreme than those observed, assuming the [[null hypothesis]] (H<sub>0</sub>) is true. It is also called the calculated probability. It is common to confuse the p-value with the [[Statistical significance|significance level (\u03b1)]], but, the \u03b1 is a predefined threshold for calling significant results. If p is less than \u03b1, the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is rejected.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19503|pmid=26961635|title=Statisticians issue warning over misuse of P values|journal=Nature|volume=531|issue=7593|pages=151|year=2016|last1=Baker|first1=Monya|bibcode=2016Natur.531..151B}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple testing ===\n\nIn multiple tests of the same hypothesis, the probability of the occurrence of [[False positives and false negatives|falses positives]] [[Family-wise error rate|(familywise error rate)]] increase and some strategy are used to control this occurrence. This is commonly achieved by using a more stringent threshold to reject null hypotheses. The [[Bonferroni correction]] defines an acceptable global significance level, denoted by  \u03b1* and each test is individually compared with a value of  \u03b1 =  \u03b1*/m. This ensures that the familywise error rate in all m tests, is less than or equal to  \u03b1*. When m is large, the Bonferroni correction may be overly conservative. An alternative to the Bonferroni correction is to control the [[False discovery rate|false discovery rate (FDR)]]. The FDR controls the expected proportion of the rejected [[Null hypothesis|null hypotheses]] (the so-called discoveries) that are false (incorrect rejections). This procedure ensures that, for independent tests, the false discovery rate is at most q*. Thus, the FDR is less conservative than the Bonferroni correction and have more power, at the cost of more false positives.<ref>Benjamini, Y. & Hochberg, Y.

Series B (Methodological) 57, 289\u2013300 (1995).</ref>\n\n=== Mis-specification and robustness checks ===\n\nThe main hypothesis being tested (e.g., no association between treatments and outcomes) is often accompanied by other technical assumptions (e.g., about the form of the probability distribution of the outcomes) that are also part of the null hypothesis. When the technical assumptions are violated in practice, then the null may be frequently rejected even if the main hypothesis is true. Such rejections are said to be due to model mis-specification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statlect.com/glossary/null-hypothesis|title=Null hypothesis|website=www.statlect.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> Verifying whether the outcome of a statistical test does not change when the technical assumptions are slightly altered (so-called robustness checks) is the main way of combating mis-specification.\n\n=== Model selection criteria ===\n\n[[Model selection|Model criteria selection]] will select or model that more approximate true model. The [[Model selection|Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)]] and The [[Model selection|Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)]] are examples of asymptotically efficient criteria.\n\n== Developments and Big Data ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\n\nRecent developments have made a large impact on biostatistics. Two important changes have been the ability to collect data on a high-throughput scale, and the ability to perform much more complex analysis using computational techniques. This comes from the development in areas as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies, [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Machine learning]] ([[Machine learning in bioinformatics]]).\n\n=== Use in high-throughput data ===\n\nNew biomedical technologies like [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[DNA sequencing|next-generation sequencers]] (for genomics) and [[mass spectrometers|mass spectrometry]] (for proteomics) generate enormous amounts of data, allowing many tests to be performed simultaneously.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hayden|first1=Erika Check|title=Biostatistics: Revealing analysis|journal=Nature|date=8 February 2012|volume=482|issue=7384|pages=263\u2013265|doi=10.1038/nj7384-263a}}</ref> Careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. For example, a microarray could be used to measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. However, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Efron|first1=Bradley|title=Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model|journal=Statistical Science|date=February 2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.1214/07-STS236|arxiv=0808.0572}}</ref>\n\n[[Multicollinearity]] often occurs in high-throughput biostatistical settings. Due to high intercorrelation between the predictors (such as [[gene expression]] levels), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). Classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. when the number of observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n < p). As a matter of fact, one can get quite high R<sup>2</sup>-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. These classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n >> p). In cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (RSS) and R<sup>2</sup> of the validation test set, not those of the training set.\n\nOften, it is useful to pool information from multiple predictors together. For example, [[Gene Set Enrichment Analysis]] (GSEA) considers the perturbation of whole (functionally related) gene sets rather than of single genes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Subramanian|first1=A.|last2=Tamayo|first2=P.|last3=Mootha|first3=V.

The advantage of this approach is that it is more robust: It is more likely that a single gene is found to be falsely perturbed than it is that a whole pathway is falsely perturbed. Furthermore, one can integrate the accumulated knowledge about biochemical pathways (like the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway]]) using this approach.\n\n=== Bioinformatics advances in databases, data mining, and biological interpretation ===\n\nThe development of [[biological database]]s enables storage and management of biological data with the possibility of ensuring access for users around the world. They are useful for researchers depositing data, retrieve information and files (raw or processed) originated from other experiments or indexing scientific articles, as [[PubMed]]. Another possibility is search for the desired term (a gene, a protein, a disease, an organism, and so on) and check all results related to this search. There are databases dedicated to [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] ([[dbSNP]]), the knowledge on genes characterization and their pathways ([[KEGG]]) and the description of gene function classifying it by cellular component, molecular function and biological process ([[Gene ontology|Gene Ontology]]).<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jcp.21218|pmid=17654500|title=Bioinformatics|journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology|volume=213|issue=2|pages=365\u20139|year=2007|last1=Moore|first1=Jason H}}</ref> In addition to databases that contain specific molecular information, there are others that are ample in the sense that they store information about an organism or group of organisms. As an example of a database directed towards just one organism, but that contains lots of data about it, is the ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' genetic and molecular database \u2013 [https://www.arabidopsis.org/ TAIR]. [http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ Phytozome], in turn, stores the assemblies and annotation files of dozen of plant genomes, also containing visualization and analysis tools. Moreover, there is an interconnection between some databases in the information exchange/sharing and a major initiative was the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]] ([http://insdc.org INSDC]) which relates data from [https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html DDBJ], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ EMBL-EBI], and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ NCBI].\n\nNowadays, increase in size and complexity of molecular datasets leads to use of powerful statistical methods provided by computer science algorithms which are developed by [[machine learning]] area. Therefore, data mining and machine learning allow detection of patterns in data with a complex structure, as biological ones, by using methods of [[Supervised learning|supervised]] and [[unsupervised learning]], regression, detection of [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] and [[Association rule learning|association rule mining]], among others.<ref name=\":4\"/> To indicate some of them, [[self-organizing map]]s and [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] are examples of cluster algorithms; [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] implementation and [[support vector machine]]s models are examples of common machine learning algorithms.\n\nCollaborative work among molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, statisticians and computer scientist is important to perform an experiment correctly, going from planning, passing through data generation and analysis, and ending with biological interpretation of the results.<ref name=\":4\"/>\n\n=== Use of computationally intensive methods ===\n\nOn the other hand, the advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] and [[Re-sampling (statistics)|re-sampling]] methods.\n\nIn recent times, [[random forests]] have gained popularity as a method for performing [[statistical classification]]. Random forest techniques generate a panel of decision trees. Decision trees have the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them (even with a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics). Random Forests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Public health ===\n[[Public health]], including [[epidemiology]], [[health services research]], [[nutrition]], [[environmental health]] and health care policy & management. In these [[medicine]] contents, it's important to consider the design and analysis of the [[clinical trial]]s.

In other words, it is desirable to discover the genetic basis of a measurable trait, a quantitative trait, that is under polygenic control. A genome region that is responsible for a continuous trait is called [[Quantitative trait locus]] (QTL). The study of QTLs become feasible by using [[molecular marker]]s and measuring traits in populations, but their mapping needs the obtaining of a population from an experimental crossing, like an F2 or [[Recombinant inbred strain]]s/lines (RILs). To scan for QTLs regions in a genome, a [[gene map]] based on linkage have to be built. Some of the best-known QTL mapping algorithms are Interval Mapping, Composite Interval Mapping, and Multiple Interval Mapping.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10709-004-2705-0|pmid=15881678|title=QTL mapping and the genetic basis of adaptation: Recent developments|journal=Genetica|volume=123|issue=1\u20132|pages=25\u201337|year=2005|last1=Zeng|first1=Zhao-Bang}}</ref>\n\nHowever, QTL mapping resolution is impaired by the amount of recombination assayed, a problem for species in which it is difficult to obtain large offspring. Furthermore, allele diversity is restricted to individuals originated from contrasting parents, which limit studies of allele diversity when we have a panel of individuals representing a natural population.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1746-4811-9-29|pmid=23876160|pmc=3750305|title=The advantages and limitations of trait analysis with GWAS: A review|journal=Plant Methods|volume=9|pages=29|year=2013|last1=Korte|first1=Arthur|last2=Farlow|first2=Ashley}}</ref> For this reason, the [[Genome-wide association study]] was proposed in order to identify QTLs based on [[linkage disequilibrium]], that is the non-random association between traits and molecular markers. It was leveraged by the development of high-throughput [[SNP genotyping]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3835/plantgenome2008.02.0089|title=Status and Prospects of Association Mapping in Plants|journal=The Plant Genome Journal|volume=1|pages=5|year=2008|last1=Zhu|first1=Chengsong|last2=Gore|first2=Michael|last3=Buckler|first3=Edward S|last4=Yu|first4=Jianming}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Animal breeding|animal]] and [[plant breeding]], the use of markers in [[Selective breeding|selection]] aiming for breeding, mainly the molecular ones, collaborated to the development of [[marker-assisted selection]]. While QTL mapping is limited due resolution, GWAS does not have enough power when rare variants of small effect that are also influenced by environment. So, the concept of Genomic Selection (GS) arises in order to use all molecular markers in the selection and allow the prediction of the performance of candidates in this selection. The proposal is to genotype and phenotype a training population, develop a model that can obtain the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of individuals belonging to a genotyped and but not phenotyped population, called testing population.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2017.08.011|pmid=28965742|title=Genomic Selection in Plant Breeding: Methods, Models, and Perspectives|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=22|issue=11|pages=961|year=2017|last1=Crossa|first1=Jos\u00e9|last2=P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez|first2=Paulino|last3=Cuevas|first3=Jaime|last4=Montesinos-L\u00f3pez|first4=Osval|last5=Jarqu\u00edn|first5=Diego|last6=De Los Campos|first6=Gustavo|last7=Burgue\u00f1o|first7=Juan|last8=Gonz\u00e1lez-Camacho|first8=Juan M|last9=P\u00e9rez-Elizalde|first9=Sergio|last10=Beyene|first10=Yoseph|last11=Dreisigacker|first11=Susanne|last12=Singh|first12=Ravi|last13=Zhang|first13=Xuecai|last14=Gowda|first14=Manje|last15=Roorkiwal|first15=Manish|last16=Rutkoski|first16=Jessica|last17=Varshney|first17=Rajeev K}}</ref> This kind of study could also include a validation population, thinking in the concept of [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]], in which the real phenotype results measured in this population are compared with the phenotype results based on the prediction, what used to check the accuracy of the model.\n\nAs a summary, some points about the application of quantitative genetics are:\n* This has been used in agriculture to improve crops ([[Plant breeding]]) and [[livestock]] ([[Animal breeding]]). \n* In biomedical research, this work can assist in finding candidates [[gene]] [[allele]]s that can cause or influence predisposition to diseases in [[human genetics]]\n\n=== Expression data ===\n\nStudies for differential expression of genes from [[RNA-Seq]] data, as for [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|RT-qPCR]] and [[microarrays]], demands comparison of conditions. The goal is to identify genes which have a significant change in abundance between different conditions. Then, experiments are designed appropriately, with replicates for each condition/treatment, randomization and blocking, when necessary. In RNA-Seq, the quantification of expression uses the information of mapped reads that are summarized in some genetic unit, as [[exon]]s that are part of a gene sequence. As [[microarray]] results can be approximated by a normal distribution, RNA-Seq counts data are better explained by other distributions. The first used distribution was the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] one, but it underestimate the sample error, leading to false positives. Currently, biological variation is considered by methods that estimate a dispersion parameter of a [[negative binomial distribution]]. [[Generalized linear model]]s are used to perform the tests for statistical significance and as the number of genes is high, multiple tests correction have to be considered.<ref>{{cite journal| doi =10.1186/gb-2010-11-12-220| pmid =21176179| title =From RNA-seq reads to differential expression results| journal =Genome Biology| volume =11| issue =12| pages =220| year =2010| last1 =Oshlack| first1 =Alicia| last2 =Robinson| first2 =Mark D| last3 =Young| first3 =Matthew D}}</ref> Some examples of other analysis on [[genomics]] data comes from microarray or [[proteomics]] experiments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data|author1=Helen Causton |author2=John Quackenbush |author3=Alvis Brazma |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|author=Terry Speed|publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC|year=2003}}</ref> Often concerning diseases or disease stages.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Biostatistics for Complex Diseases|author1=Frank Emmert-Streib |author2=Matthias Dehmer |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn= 3-527-32585-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Other studies ===\n\n* [[Ecology]], [[ecological forecasting]]\n* Biological [[sequence analysis]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics: An Introduction|author1=Warren J.

Developed by a company with the same name ([[SAS Institute]]), it uses [[SAS language]] for programming.\n* [[R (programming language)|R]]: An open source environment and programming language dedicated to statistical computing and graphics. It is an implementation of [[S]] language maintained by [https://cran.r-project.org/ CRAN]. In addition to its functions to read data tables, take descriptive statistics, develop and evaluate models, its repository contains packages developed by researchers around the world. This allows the development of functions written to deal with the statistical analysis of data that comes from specific applications. In the case of Bioinformatics, for example, there are packages located in the main repository (CRAN) and in others, as [[Bioconductor]]. It is also possible to use packages under development that are shared in hosting-services as [[GitHub]].\n* [[ASReml]]: Another software developed by [https://www.vsni.co.uk/ VSNi] that can be used also in R environment as a package. It is developed to estimate variance components under a general linear mixed model using [[restricted maximum likelihood]] (REML). Models with fixed effects and random effects and nested or crossed ones are allowed. Gives the possibility to investigate different [[Covariance matrix|variance-covariance]] matrix structures.\n* [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]]: A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software for [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]], including tools and methods for visualization, clustering, regression, association rule, and classification.

They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.\n\nIn the United States, where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as [[epidemiology]]. Thus, departments carrying the name \"biostatistics\" may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of [[public health]], will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and [[clinical trial]]s as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities around the world, where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry ([[quality control]]), business and [[economics]] and biological areas other than medicine.\n\n== Specialized journals ==\n\n* [https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics Biostatistics]\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ijb International Journal of Biostatistics]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/journals/j-epidemiol-biostat/ Journal of Epidemiology and Biostatistics]\n* [https://ebph.it/ Epidemiology Biostatistics and Public Health]\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15410420 Biometrics]\n* [https://academic.oup.com/biomet Biometrika]\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15214036 Biometrical Journal]\n* [http://agrobiol.sggw.waw.pl/cbcs/ Communications in Biometry and Crop Science]\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/sagmb Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology]\n* [http://journals.sagepub.com/home/smm Statistical Methods in Medical Research]\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15391612 Pharmaceutical Statistics]\n* [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970258 Statistics in Medicine]\n* [https://www.jscimedcentral.com/Biometrics/editors.php Annals of biometrics and biostatistics] \n* [http://thescipub.com/journals/ajbs Current research in biostatistics]\n* [https://publons.com/journal/36965/american-journal-of-biostatistics American Journal of Biostatistics]\n \n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bioinformatics]]\n* [[Epidemiological method]]\n* [[Epidemiology]]\n* [[Group size measures]]\n* [[Health indicator]]\n* [[List of statistics journals#Biostatistics|List of biostatistics journals]]\n* [[Mathematical and theoretical biology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [https://www.biometricsociety.org/ The International Biometric Society]\n* [http://www.biostatsresearch.com/repository/ The Collection of Biostatistics Research Archive]\n* [http://www.medpagetoday.com/lib/content/Medpage-Guide-to-Biostatistics.pdf Guide to Biostatistics (MedPageToday.com)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402180351/http://www.biostat.katerynakon.in.ua/en/ Biomedical Statistics]\n\n{{Statistics|applications}}\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{Public health}}\n\n[[Category:Biostatistics| ]]\n[[Category:Bioinformatics]]\n[[Category:Public health]]\n[[Category:Demography]]", "sha1": "dbgk6cxg23as5nmvkrrp6q9h9yp8j8b"}}, {"title": "Business statistics", "ns": "0", "id": "3879", "revision": {"id": "852617633", "parentid": "843476364", "timestamp": "2018-07-30T06:34:52Z", "contributor": {"ip": "169.202.5.9"}, "comment": "/* See also */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2009}}\n{{Business administration}}\n\n'''\"Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]],  [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement and marketing research\".<ref>\u2022 \n''[[Journal of Business & Economic Statistics]]'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm \"''Journal of Business & Economic Statistics'', American Statistical Association.\"]</ref>\n\nThese sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data.

[[rugby union]] team selected from players eligible for any of the [[Home Nations]] \u2013 the national teams of [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] &ndash; and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]].  The Lions are a [[Test match (rugby union)|Test]] side, and generally select international players, but they can pick [[Cap (sport)|uncapped]] players available to any one of the four unions. The team currently tours every four years, with these rotating among Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The [[2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa|2009 Test series]] was lost {{win-loss record|w=1|l=2}} to [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], while the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 Test series]] was won {{win-loss record|w=2|l=1}} over Australia. The most recent series, the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|2017 series]] against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], was drawn 1-1 (with one match drawn).\n\nFrom 1888 onwards combined rugby sides from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] toured the Southern Hemisphere. The first tour was a commercial venture, and was undertaken without official backing.<ref name=\"Griffiths9:3\">Griffiths (1987), pg 9:3.</ref> The six subsequent visits enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities, before the 1910 South Africa tour, which was the first tour representative of the four Home Unions.<ref name=\"Griffiths9:6\">Griffiths (1987), pg 9:6.</ref> In 1949 the four Home Unions formally created a Tours Committee<ref name=\"Godwin231\">Godwin (1981), pg 231.</ref> and for the first time, every player of the 1950 Lions squad had played internationally before the tour.<ref name=\"Griffiths9:8\">Griffiths (1987), pg 9\u20138.</ref> The 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games, but the Test series were typically lost or drawn. The winning series in 1971 (New Zealand) and 1974 (South Africa) changed this pattern. The last tour of the [[amateurism|amateur]] age took place in 1993. The Lions have also played occasional matches in the Northern Hemisphere either as one-off exhibitions or as an element of a tour which mostly took place in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n== Naming and symbols ==\n\n=== Team members ===\n{{main article|List of British and Irish Lions players}}\n\nThe multi-nation team that is today named the British and Irish Lions first came into existence in 1888 as the Shaw and Shrewsbury Team. It was then primarily English in composition but also contained players from Scotland and Wales. Later the team used the name British Isles. On their [[1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1950 tour]] of New Zealand and Australia they officially adopted the name British Lions, the nickname first used by British and South African journalists on the 1924 South African tour<ref name=\"Godwin231\" /> after the lion emblem on their ties, the emblem on their jerseys having been dropped in favour of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions.\n\nWhen the team first emerged in the 19th century, it represented the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], then one single state. The team continued to exist after the [[Irish war of independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] and the subsequent division of Ireland in 1922 into the [[Irish Free State]] (later the [[Republic of Ireland]]) and [[Northern Ireland]]. To avoid ambiguity and possible offence to Irish players, it was later decided to define the team's identity as representing the two sovereign states \u2013 the United Kingdom and Ireland \u2013 with the team members being either \"British\" or \"Irish\". From the [[2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2001 tour]] of Australia, the official name British and Irish Lions has been used. The team is often referred to simply as the Lions.\n\n=== Team anthem ===\nAs the Lions represent two sovereign states, they do not have a national anthem. However, for the 1989 tour, the British national anthem \"[[God Save the Queen]]\" was used.<ref>{{cite book | first =Donal | last =Lenihan  | title =Donal Lenihan: My Life in Rugby | publisher = Random House | edition =   | year = 2016 | isbn = 1848272251 | page = 214}}</ref> For the 2005 tour to New Zealand, the Lions management commissioned a song, \"[[The Power of Four]]\", although it was met with little support among Lions fans at the matches and has not been used since.\n\n=== Team colours and strip ===\nFor more than half a century, the Lions have been synonymous with the red jersey that sports the amalgamated crests of the four unions. However, prior to 1950 the strip went through a number of significantly different formats.<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607011421/http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/412.php \"Lions change stripes\" at Lions website, 17 April 2005] (archive)</ref>\n\n==== Unsanctioned tours ====\nIn 1888, the promoter of the first expedition to Australia and New Zealand, [[Arthur Shrewsbury]], demanded \"something that would be good material and yet take them by storm out here\".<ref name=\"Misc\">{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Bath |title=The British & Irish Lions Miscellany| page=76| year=2008 |publisher=Vision Sports Publishing |location=London}}</ref> The result was a jersey in thick red, white and blue hoops, worn above white shorts and dark socks. The tours to South Africa in 1891 and 1896 retained the red, white and blue theme but this time as red and white hooped jerseys and dark blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Misc\" /> The 1899 trip to Australia saw a reversion to red, white and blue jerseys, but with the blue used in thick hoops and the red and white in thin bands. The shorts remained blue, as did the socks although a white flash was added to the latter. The one-off test in 1999 between England and Australia that was played to commemorate Australia's first test against [[Matthew Mullineux|Reverend Matthew Mullineux]]'s British side saw England wear an updated version of this jersey.<ref name=\"Misc\" /> In 1903, the South Africa tour followed on from the 1896 tour, with red and white hooped jerseys. The slight differences were that the red hoops were slightly thicker than the white (the opposite was true in 1896), and the white flash on the socks introduced in 1899 was partially retained.<ref name=\"Misc\" /> The Australia tour of 1904 saw exactly the same kit as in 1899, and it seemed that the British touring sides had settled on kits particular to the host destination. However, in 1908 with the Scottish and Irish unions refusing to be involved, the Anglo-Welsh side only sported red jerseys with a thick white band on their jerseys on tour to Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\" /> Blue shorts were retained, but the socks were for the first time red, with a white flash.\n\n==== Blue jerseys, the Lions named and the crest adopted ====\n[[File:Logo Lions Rugby.svg|thumb|right|125px|The Lions crest adopted in 1924]]\nThe Scots were once again involved in Dr Tom Smyth's 1910 team to South Africa. Thus, dark blue jerseys, were introduced with white shorts and the red socks of 1908.<ref name=\"Misc\" /> The jerseys also had a single lion-rampant crest. The 1924 tour returned to South Africa, retaining the blue jerseys but now with shorts to match. It is the 1924 tour that is credited as being the first in which the team were referred to as \"the Lions\", the irony being that it was on this tour that the single lion-rampant crest was replaced with the forerunner of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions, that is still worn today. Although the lion had been dropped from the jersey, the players had worn the lion motif on their ties as they arrived in South Africa, which led the press and public referring to them as \"the Lions\".<ref>Richard Bath, ''The British & Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 1, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)</ref>\n\nThe unofficial [[1927 British Lions tour to Argentina|1927 Argentina tour]] used the same kit and badge.<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\" /> So powerful was the attribution of \"the Lions\" nickname that three heraldic versions of the animal returned as the jersey badge in 1930.<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\" /> This was the tour to New Zealand where the tourists' now standard blue jerseys caused some controversy. The convention in rugby is for the home side to accommodate its guests when there is a clash of kit. The New Zealand side, by then already synonymous with the appellation \"All Blacks\", had an all black kit that clashed with the Lions' blue. After much reluctance and debate New Zealand agreed to change for the Tests and the All Blacks became the All Whites for the first time. On the 1930 tour a delegation led by the Irish lock [[George Beamish]] expressed their displeasure at the fact that whilst the blue of Scotland, white of England and red of Wales were represented in the strip there was no green for Ireland. A green flash was added to the socks, which from 1938 became a green turnover (although on blue socks thus eliminating red from the kit), and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since.<ref name=\"Misc2\">Richard Bath, ''The British & Irish Lions Miscellany'', page 77, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London)</ref> In 1936, the four-quartered badge returned for the [[1936 British Lions tour to Argentina|tour to Argentina]] and has remained on the kits ever since,<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\" /> but other than that the strip remained the same.\n\n====Red jerseys====\nThe adoption of the red jersey happened in the 1950 tour. A return to New Zealand was accompanied by a desire to avoid the controversy of 1930 and so red replaced blue for the jersey with the resultant kit being that which is still worn today, the combination of red jersey, white shorts and green and blue socks, representing the four unions.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6531017.ece Lions name is a source of great pride] ''[[The Times]]'' 19 June 2009</ref> The only additions to the strip since 1950 began appearing in 1993, with the addition of kit suppliers logos in prominent positions. Umbro had in 1989 asked for \"maximum brand exposure whenever possible\" but this did not affect the kit's appearance. Since then, Nike, Adidas and Canterbury have had more overt branding on the shirts, with sponsors [[Scottish Provident]] (1997), [[NTL:Telewest|NTL]] (2001), [[Zurich Assurance|Zurich]] (2005), [[HSBC]] (2009 and 2013)<ref name=\"2013jersey\">{{cite web|url=http://rugbyshirts.net/2013-british-lions-shirt-launched-6200.html|title=2013 British Lions Shirt Launched|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Misc2\" /> and [[Standard Life Aberdeen|Standard Life Investments]] (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punditarena.com/rugby/bbarry/lions-new-jersey-2017-new-zealand/ |work=Pundit Arena |title=Pics: Lions Release New Jersey Ahead of 2017 Tour To New Zealand |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Jersey evolution ====\n<ref name=\"Lionsstripes\" />\n{|\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_redbluehoops|pattern_b=_redbluehoops|pattern_ra=_redbluehoops|leftarm=ffffff|body=ffffff|rightarm=ffffff|shorts=ffffff|socks=000066|title=1888}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_thinredhoops|pattern_b=_thinredhoops|pattern_ra=_thinredhoops|leftarm=ffffff|body=ffffff|rightarm=ffffff|shorts=000066|socks=000066|title=1891\u20131896}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_redwhitehoops|pattern_b=_redwhitehoops|pattern_ra=_redwhitehoops|pattern_so=_2_white_stripes|leftarm=000088|body=000088|rightarm=000088|shorts=000066|socks=000066|title=1899\u20131904}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_whitehorizontal|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_white_band_color|leftarm=ff0000|body=ff0000|rightarm=ff0000|shorts =000066|socks=ff0000|title=1908}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_collarwhite|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_whitetop|leftarm=000099|body=000099|rightarm=000099|shorts=ffffff|socks=ff0000|title=1910\u20131938}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_collarwhite|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_greentop|leftarm=ff0000|body=ff0000|rightarm=ff0000|shorts=ffffff|socks=000099|title=1950\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1888\u20131909 ===\n[[File:British lions 1888.jpg|thumb|Shaw & Shrewsbury Team, 1888, The first British or Irish touring rugby team, a private-enterprise trip to Australia and New Zealand.]]\n[[File:Image-England-Team,-SA-1891.jpg|thumb|Despite its label as an England side, the team which toured South Africa in 1891 contained several Scots.]]\n[[File:England-v-Cape-Colony-1891.jpg|thumb|England v Cape Colony, 1891. The first match of the Bill MacLagan undefeated tour of South Africa.]]\nThe earliest tours date back to 1888, when a 21-man squad visited Australia and New Zealand. The squad drew players from England, Scotland and Wales, though English players predominated. The 35-match tour of two host nations included no tests, but the side played provincial, city and academic sides, winning 27 matches. They played 19 games of [[Australian rules football]], against prominent clubs in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia, winning six and drawing one of these (see [[Australian rules football in England]]).\n\nThe first tour, although unsanctioned by rugby bodies, established the concept of Northern Hemisphere sporting sides touring to the Southern Hemisphere. Three years after the first tour, the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province union]] invited rugby bodies in Britain to tour South Africa. Some saw the [[1891 British Lions tour to South Africa|1891 team]] \u2013 the first sanctioned by the [[Rugby Football Union]] \u2013 as the [[England national rugby union team|English national team]], though others referred to it as \"the British Isles\". The tourists played a total of twenty matches, three of them tests. The team also played the regional side of South Africa (South Africa did not exist as a political unit in 1891), winning all three matches. In a notable event of the tour, the touring side presented the [[Currie Cup]] to [[Griqualand West]], the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.\n\nFive years later a British Isles side returned to South Africa. They played one extra match on this tour, making the total of 21 games, including four tests against South Africa, with the British Isles winning three of them. The squad had a notable Irish orientation, with the Irish national team contributing six players to the 21-man squad.\n\nIn 1899 the British Isles touring side returned to Australia for the first time since the unofficial tour of 1888. The squad of 23 for the first time ever had players from each of the home nations. The team again participated in 21 matches, playing state teams as well as northern [[Queensland]] sides and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] teams. A four-test series took place against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], the tourists winning three out of the four. The team returned via Hawaii and Canada playing additional games en route.\n\nFour years later, in 1903, the British Isles team returned to South Africa. The opening performance of the side proved disappointing from the tourists' point of view, with defeats in its opening three matches by Western Province sides in [[Cape Town]]. From then on the team experienced mixed results, though more wins than losses. The side lost the test series to South Africa, drawing twice, but with the South Africans winning the decider 8 to nil.\n\nNo more than twelve months passed before the British Isles team ventured to Australia and New Zealand in 1904. The tourists devastated the Australian teams, winning every single game. Australia also lost all three tests to the visitors, even getting held to a standstill in two of the three games. Though the New Zealand leg of the tour did not take long in comparison to the number of Australian games, the British Isles experienced considerable difficulty across the Tasman after whitewashing the Australians. The team managed two early wins before losing the test to New Zealand and only winning one more game as well as drawing once. Despite their difficulties in New Zealand, the tour proved a raging success on-field for the British Isles.\n\nIn 1908, another tour took place to Australia and New Zealand. In a reversal of previous practice, the planners allocated more matches in New Zealand rather than in Australia: perhaps the strength of the New Zealand teams and the heavy defeats of all Australian teams on the previous tour influenced this decision. Some commentators thought that this tour hoped to reach out to rugby communities in Australia, as rugby league (infamously) started in Australia in 1908. The Anglo-Welsh side (Irish and Scottish unions did not participate) performed well in all the non-test matches, but drew a test against New Zealand and lost the other two.\n\n=== 1910\u20131949 ===\nVisits that took place before the 1910 South Africa tour (the first selected by a committee from the four Home Unions) had enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities, although only one of these included representatives of all four nations. The 1910 tour to South Africa marked the official beginning of British Isles rugby tours: the inaugural tour operating under all four unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The test series, however, went to South Africa, who won two of the three games. A side managed by Oxford University \u2014 supposedly the England rugby team, but actually including three Scottish players \u2014 [[1910 British Lions tour to Argentina|toured Argentina]] at the time: the people of Argentina termed it the \"Combined British\".\n\nThe next British Isles team tour did not take place until [[1924 British Lions tour to South Africa|1924]], again in South Africa. The team, led by [[Ronald Cove-Smith]], struggled with injuries and lost three of the four test matches, drawing the other 3\u20133. In total, 21 games were played, with the touring side winning 9, drawing 3 and losing 9.\n\n[[File:British lions fourth test arg 1927.jpg|thumb|right|The British Lions before playing the 4th. test v. [[Argentina national rugby team|Argentina]] during their second tour to the country in [[1927 British Lions tour to Argentina|1927]]]]\nIn [[1927 British Lions tour to Argentina|1927]] a short, nine-game series took place in [[Argentina]], with the British isles winning all nine encounters; the tour did however become a financial success for [[Rugby union in Argentina|Argentine rugby]]. After a seemingly long absence from New Zealand, the Lions returned in 1930 to some success. The Lions won all of their games that did not have test status except for the matches against [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Canterbury]]; they did however lose three of their four test matches against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], winning the first test 6\u20133. The side also visited Australia, losing a test but winning five out of the six non-test games.\n\nIn [[1936 British Lions tour to Argentina|1936]] the British Isles visited Argentina for the third time, winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour. Two years later in 1938 the British Isles toured in South Africa, winning more than half of their normal matches. Despite having lost the test series to South Africa by game three, they won the final test. This is when they were named THE LIONS by their then Captain Sam Walker.\n\n=== 1950\u20131969 ===\nThe first post-war tour went to New Zealand and Australia in 1950. The Lions, sporting newly redesigned jerseys and displaying a fresh style of play, managed to win 22 and draw one of 29 matches over the two nations. The Lions won the opening four fixtures before losing to [[Otago]] and [[Southland Region|Southland]], but succeeded in holding the All Blacks to a 9\u20139 draw. The Lions performed well in the remaining All Black tests though they lost all three, the team did not lose another non-test in the New Zealand leg of the tour. The Lions won all their games in Australia except for their final fixture against a [[New South Wales]] XV in [[Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]]. They won both tests against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] and in Sydney.\n\nIn 1955 the Lions toured South Africa and left with another imposing record, one draw and 19 wins from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], a thrilling affair, ended in a drawn series.\n\nThe 1959 tour to Australia and New Zealand marked once again a very successful tour for the Lions, who only lost six of their 35 fixtures. The Lions easily won both tests against Australia and lost the first three tests against New Zealand, but did find victory (9\u20136) in the final test.\n\nAfter the glittering decade of the 1950s, the first tour of the 1960s proved not nearly as successful as previous ones. The 1962 tour to South Africa saw the Lions still win 16 of their 25 games, but did not fare well against the Springboks, losing three of the four tests. For the 1966 tour to Australia and New Zealand [[John Robins (rugby player)|John Robins]] became the first Lions Coach, and the trip started off very well for the Lions, who stormed through Australia, winning five non-tests and drawing one; and most notably defeating Australia in two tests as well. The Lions however experienced mixed results during the New Zealand leg of the tour, as well as losing all of the tests against the All Blacks. The Lions also played a test against [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] on their way home, winning 19 to 8 in [[Toronto]]. The 1968 tour of South Africa saw the Lions win 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but the team actually lost three tests against the Springboks and drew one.\n\n=== 1970\u20131979 ===\nThe 1970s saw a renaissance for the Lions. The 1971 team, centred around the skilled Welsh half-back pairing of [[Gareth Edwards]] and [[Barry John]], secured a series win over the All Blacks. The tour started with a loss to Queensland but proceeded to storm through the next provincial fixtures, winning 11 games in a row. The Lions then went on to defeat the All Blacks in [[Dunedin]]. The Lions would only lose a single match on the rest of the tour, and won the test series against New Zealand, winning and drawing the last two games, to take the series two wins to one.\n\nOne of the best-known and most successful Lions team toured South Africa in 1974 under the esteemed Irish forward [[Willie John McBride]]. It went through 22 games unbeaten, and triumphed 3\u20130 (with one drawn) in the test open series. The test series featured a lot of violence. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression. At that time, test match referees came from the home nation, substitutions took place only if a doctor found a player unable to continue and there were no video cameras or sideline officials to prevent violent play. The Lions decided \"to get their retaliation in first\" with the infamous \"[[99 call]]\". The Lions postulated that a South African referee would probably not send off all of the Lions if they all retaliated against \"blatant thuggery\". Famous video footage of the 'battle of [[EPRFU Stadium|Boet Erasmus Stadium']] shows [[JPR Williams]] running over half of the pitch and launching himself at Van Heerden after such a call.\n\nThe 1977 tour to New Zealand saw the Lions drop only one non-test out of 21 games, a loss to a Universities side. The team did not win the test series though, winning one game but losing the other three.\n\nIn August 1977 the British Lions made a stopover in Fiji on the way home from their tour of New Zealand. Fiji beat them 25\u201321 at Buckhurst Park, Suva.\n\n=== 1980\u20132005 ===\n[[File:British and Irish Lions scrum.jpg|thumb|The British and Irish Lions against New Zealand in 2005]]\n\nThe Lions toured [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa in 1980]], and completed a flawless non-test record, winning 14 out of 14 matches. The Lions however lost the first three tests to South Africa, winning the last one, with the series already won by the Springboks.\n\nThe [[1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1983 tour to New Zealand]] saw the team successful in the non-test games, winning all but two games, but being whitewashed in the test series against the All Blacks.\n\nA tour to South Africa by the Lions was anticipated in 1986. However, the invitation for the Lions to tour South Africa was never accepted because of controversy surrounding [[Apartheid]], and the tour did not go ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/155605.html#|title=The Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career and Shane Williams' try-scoring rate |date=5 December 2011|last=Griffiths|first=John|work=ESPN scrum|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> The Lions did not return to South Africa until 1997, after the Apartheid era.

The tour was very successful for the Lions, who won all eight non-test matches and won the test series against Australia, two to one.\n\nThe tour to [[1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand|New Zealand in 1993]] was the last of the amateur era. The Lions won six and lost four non-test matches, and lost the test series 2\u20131.\nThe tour to [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa in 1997]] was a success for the Lions, who completed the tour with only two losses, and won the test series 2\u20131.\n\nIn 2001, the ten-game [[2001 British Lions tour to Australia|tour to Australia]] saw the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] win the test series 2\u20131.

The first test was followed shortly after this, which saw the Lions go 1-up over Australia winning 23\u201321. Australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game, but a missed penalty by [[Kurtley Beale]] saw the Lions take the win. The Wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16\u201315, though the Lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by [[Leigh Halfpenny]]. With tour captain Warburton out of the final test due to injury, [[Alun Wyn Jones]] took over the captaincy in the final test in Sydney. The final test was won by the Lions in what was a record win, winning 41\u201316 to earn their first series win since [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|1997]] and their first over Australia since [[1989 British Lions tour to Australia|1989]].\n\n===2017===\n{{Main|2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand}}\n\nFollowing his winning tour of Australia in 2013, Warren Gatland was reappointed as Lions Head Coach for the tour to New Zealand in June and July 2017. In April 2016, it was announced that the side would again be captained again by [[Sam Warburton]]. The touring schedule included 10 games: an opening game against the [[New Zealand Barbarians|Provincial Barbarians]], challenge matches against all five of New Zealand's [[Super Rugby]] sides, a match against the [[M\u0101ori All Blacks]] and three tests against {{nrut|New Zealand}}. The Lions defeated the Barbarians in the first game of the tour, before being beaten by the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Blues]] three days later. The team recovered to beat the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] but this was followed up with another midweek loss, this time against the [[Highlanders (rugby union)|Highlanders]]. The Lions then faced the M\u0101ori All Blacks, winning comfortably to restore optimism and followed up with their first midweek victory of the tour against the [[Chiefs (rugby union)|Chiefs]].\n\nOn 24 June, the Lions, captained by [[Peter O'Mahony]], faced New Zealand in [[Eden Park]] in the first Test and were beaten 30\u201315. This was followed by the final midweek game of the tour, a draw against the [[Hurricanes (rugby union)|Hurricanes]]. For the second Test, Gatland recalled Warburton to his starting team, restoring his captaincy. In [[Wellington Regional Stadium]], the Lions beat New Zealand 24\u201321 to tie the series going into the final game, ending the side's 47-game winning run at home. In the final test at Eden Park the following week, the teams played out a draw, ending the Test match series in a tie for the first time in the history of competition between the sides.\n\n== Overall ==\n\n'''Overall test matches'''\n\nUpdated after the 2017 Tour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

They also routinely toured in Argentina before the [[Second World War]]. Tours currently take place every four years. The most recent tour [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|was to New Zealand in 2017]], and before that the Lions toured [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|visited Australia in June\u2013July 2013]].\n\nIn a break with tradition, a \"home\" fixture against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] took place at [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff on 23 May 2005, before the Lions went to [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]]. It finished in a draw, 25\u201325.\n\nOn tour, games take place against local provinces, clubs or representative sides as well as the full tests against the host's national team.\n\nThe Lions, and their predecessor teams, have often played games against other nearby countries on tour. For example, they played [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Rhodesia]] (the future [[Zimbabwe]]) in [[1910 British Lions tour to South Africa|1910]], [[1924 British Lions tour to South Africa|1924]], [[1938 British Lions tour to South Africa|1938]], [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]] & [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]] during their tours to South Africa. They also were beaten by [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] on their [[1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1977 tour to New Zealand]]. In addition, they toured pre-independence [[Namibia]] (then [[South West Africa]]), in [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]], and [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]].\n\nThere have also been games in other countries on the way home. These include games in {{nrut|Canada}} in [[1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1959]] and [[1966 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand|1966]], [[East Africa rugby union team|East Africa]] (then mostly [[Kenya]], and held in [[Nairobi]]), and an unofficial game against [[Sri Lanka national rugby union team|Ceylon]] (future Sri Lanka) in [[1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1950]].\n\nPrevious tours have seen some non-Test players become demotivated, but more recently this issue has reduced because of high injury rates, increased use of replacements and greater selection flexibility.\n\nIn recent tours a common issue has been weak opposition in many non-Test games, partly as opposition countries have their top players in national training camps, partly as sides protect top players for domestic games which are seen as more commercially important than Lions games, and possibly partly to prevent the Lions having high standard preparatory games. However, quite a few New Zealand internationals lined out in non-Test matches in 2017.\n\n=== Results ===\n\n==== Tour Test matches ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!To\n!Captain\n!Head coach\n!Top scorer in Tests\n!Result\n!Tests record\n|-\n|1888\n|[[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|New Zealand<br /> & Australia]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Robert Seddon]]<br />{{Flagicon|England}} [[Andrew Stoddart]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Alfred Shaw]]<br />{{Flagicon|England}} [[Arthur Shrewsbury]]\n|colspan=\"3\"|''No Test matches played''\n|-\n|1891\n|[[1891 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa]]\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Bill Maclagan]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} Edwin Ash\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Arthur Rotherham]], 4\n|Won\n|{{win-loss record|w=3|l=0}}\n|-\n|1896\n|[[1896 British Lions tour to South Africa|South Africa]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Johnny Hammond (rugby player)|Johnny Hammond]]<br />[[Thomas Crean]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Roger Walker (rugby)|Roger Walker]]\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[J.

The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]], to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\nSince the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]] as the bass instrument in the [[rhythm section]].<ref>Roberts, Jim (2001).

The 1935 sales catalog for Tutmarc's electronic musical instrument company, Audiovox, featured his \"Model 736 Bass [[Fiddle]]\", a four-stringed, solid-bodied, fretted electric bass instrument with a {{convert|30+1/2|in|mm|0|adj=on|abbr=off}} scale length.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vintageguitar.com/1782/audiovox-736/ |title = Audiovox #736: The World's First Electric Bass Guitar! |publisher = Vintage Guitar |date = June 19, 2017 }}</ref> The adoption of a guitar's body shape made the instrument easier to hold and transport than any of the existing stringed bass instruments. The addition of frets enabled [[bassist]]s to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or [[electric upright bass]]es.

Fender's [[Fender Precision Bass]], which began production in October 1951, became a widely copied industry standard for the instrument. The Precision Bass (or \"P-bass\") evolved from a simple, un-contoured \"slab\" body design and a [[single coil pickup]] similar to that of a [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]], to a contoured body design with beveled edges for comfort and a split [[single coil]] pickup.\n\n[[File:Fender Bass Guitar Patent.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Design patent issued to Leo Fender for the second-generation Precision Bass]]\n\nThe \"Fender Bass\" was a revolutionary new instrument for gigging musicians. In comparison with the large, heavy [[upright bass]], which had been the main bass instrument in popular music, folk and country music from the early 1900s to the 1940s, the Fender bass could be easily transported to shows. The bass guitar was also less prone to unwanted [[Larsen effect|feedback]] sounds when amplified, than acoustic bass instruments.<ref>Book review of ''How The Fender Bass Changed The World''.

The [[Gibson EB-3|EB-3]], introduced in 1961, also had a \"mini-humbucker\" at the bridge position. Gibson basses also tended to be smaller, sleeker instruments; Gibson did not produce a {{convert|34|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale bass until 1963 with the release of the [[Gibson Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], which was also the first Gibson bass to use dual-humbucking pickups in a more traditional position, about halfway between the neck and bridge. A number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s: [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]] in 1952, [[Hofner]] and [[Danelectro]] in 1956, [[Rickenbacker]] in 1957 and [[Burns London|Burns]]/Supersound in 1958.<ref name=\"Bacon2000\">Bacon, Tony (2000).

The Fender and Gibson versions used bolt-on and glued-on necks.\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\nWith the explosion of the popularity of [[rock music]] in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including the Japanese manufacturers [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Teisco]] and [[Guyatone]]. First introduced in 1960, the [[Fender Jazz Bass]] was known as the Deluxe Bass and was meant to accompany the [[Jazzmaster]] guitar. The Jazz Bass (often referred to as a \"J-bass\") featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass' split coil pickup position. The earliest production basses had a 'stacked' volume and tone control for each pickup. This was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single, passive tone control. The Jazz Bass' neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass \u2014 {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm|0}} versus {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|0}} \u2014 allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.\n\n[[File:70's Fender Jazz Bass.jpg|thumb|upright|right|1970s [[Fender Jazz Bass]] with maple fretboard]]\n\nAnother visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its \"offset-waist\" body. Pickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as \"P\" or \"J\" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]].\n\nFender also began production of the [[Fender Mustang Bass|Mustang Bass]]; a {{convert|30|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length instrument used by bassists such as [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Talking Heads]] and [[Bill Wyman]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] (\"P\" and \"J\" basses have a scale length of {{convert|34|in|mm|0}}, a design echoed on most current production electric basses of all makes). In the 1950s and 1960s, the instrument was often called the \"Fender bass\", due to [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early dominance in the market.  The [[Fender VI]], a baritone guitar, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning. It was released in 1961, and was favored by [[Jack Bruce]] of [[Cream (band)|Cream]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://fenderbassplayer.com/160-jack-bruce-cream-of-the-crop |title = Jack Bruce: Cream of the Crop |author = Fender Bass Player Videos |publisher =  |accessdate = March 29, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nGibson introduced the short-scale {{convert|30+1/2|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[Gibson EB-3|EB-3]] in 1961, also used by [[Jack Bruce]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vintageguitar.com/3568/the-gibson-eb-3/ |title = The Gibson EB-3 |first = Vintage |last = Guitar |date = March 10, 2010 |website = vintageguitar.com |accessdate = September 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\n[[File:Rickenbacker Bass 4001JG.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rickenbacker 4001]] bass]]\n\nIn 1971, [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] established the template for what became known as \"boutique\" or \"high-end\" electric bass guitars. These expensive, custom-tailored instruments, as used by [[Phil Lesh]], [[Jack Casady]], and [[Stanley Clarke]], featured unique designs, premium hand-finished wood bodies, and innovative construction techniques such as multi-laminate [[Neck-thru|neck-through-body]] construction and [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite]] necks. Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization. Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses, and In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument. Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nSpecific bass brands/models became identified with particular styles of music, such as the Rickenbacker 4001 series, which became identified with progressive rock bassists like [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], while the StingRay was used by funk/disco players such [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of the funk band [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of Chic. The 4001 stereo bass was introduced in the late 1960s; it can be heard on the Beatles' \"I Am The Walrus.\" <ref>{{cite book |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Womack |date=November 21, 2016 |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Everything Fab Four |url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=87NQDQAAQBAJ |access-date=January 18, 2018 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=220 |isbn=1440844275}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other boutique bass manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], produced four-string and five-string basses with a low \"B\" string. In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3. In comparison with a standard four-string bass, Jackson's six-string adds a low B string and a high C string. These 5 and 6-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]] as they reduced the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowed the bassist to play more notes from the same position on the fretboard with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\n\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]].  In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market  at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular amongst new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].\n\n== Design considerations ==\n\nBass bodies are typically made of wood, although other materials such as [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite]] (for example, some of the [[Steinberger]] designs) and other lightweight composite materials have also been used. While a wide variety of [[tonewood|woods]] are suitable for use in the body, neck, and fretboard of the bass guitar, the most common types of wood used are similar to those used for electric guitars; [[alder]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] or [[mahogany]] for the body, [[maple]] for the neck, and [[rosewood (timber)|rosewood]] or [[ebony]] for the fretboard. While these traditional standards are most common, for tonal or aesthetic reasons luthiers more commonly experiment with different tonewoods on basses than with electric guitars (though this is changing), and rarer woods like [[walnut]] and figured [[maple]], as well as exotic woods like [[bubinga]], [[wenge]], [[koa]], and [[peltogyne|purpleheart]], are often used as accent woods in the neck or on the face of mid- to high-priced production basses and on custom-made and boutique instruments.\n\nOther design options include finishes, such as lacquer, wax and oil; flat and carved designs; [[luthier]]-produced custom-designed instruments; headless basses, which have tuning machines in the bridge of the instrument (e.g., [[Steinberger]] and [[Hohner]] designs) and several artificial materials such as [[luthite]]. The use of artificial materials (e.g., [[BassLab]]) allows for unique production techniques such as die-casting, to produce complex body shapes. While most basses have solid bodies, they can also include hollow chambers to increase the resonance or reduce the weight of the instrument. Some basses are built with entirely hollow bodies, which change the tone and resonance of the instrument. [[Acoustic bass guitar]]s have a hollow wooden body constructed similarly to an [[acoustic guitar]], and are typically equipped with [[piezoelectric]] or magnetic pickups and amplified.\n\nInstruments handmade by highly skilled luthiers are becoming increasingly available in the 2010s. Exotic materials in high-end instruments include woods such as [[bubinga]], [[wenge]], [[ovangkol]], [[ebony]], and [[goncalo alves]]. Some makers use [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite composite]] to make lightweight necks<ref>There is a potted summary and description of graphite neck construction at http://wiki.basschat.co.uk/info:tech:use_of_composites_graphite_necks_in_bass_guitar_design {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722131644/http://wiki.basschat.co.uk/info:tech:use_of_composites_graphite_necks_in_bass_guitar_design |date=July 22, 2009 }}.</ref><ref>e.g., Status brand basses, which are made from graphite.</ref> More expensive basses often feature exotic woods. For example, Alembic uses cocobolo as a body or top layer material because of its attractive grain. Warwick bass guitars are well known for exotic hardwoods, making most necks out of [[ovangkol]], and fingerboards from [[wenge]] or [[ebony]]. Some makers use solid [[bubinga]] bodies for their tonal and aesthetic qualities.\n\nA common feature of more expensive basses is \"neck-through\" construction. Instead of milling the body from a single piece of wood (or \"bookmatched\" halves) and then attaching the neck into a pocket (so-called \"bolt-on\" design), neck-through basses are constructed first by assembling the neck, which may comprise one, three, five or more layers of wood in vertical stripes, which are longer than the length of the fretboard. To this elongated neck, the body is attached as two ''wings,'' which may also be made up of several layers. The entire bass is then milled and shaped. ''Neck-through'' construction advertisements claim this approach provides better sustain and a mellower tone than ''bolt-on'' neck construction. While neck-through construction is most common in handmade \"boutique\" basses, some models of mass-produced basses such as Ibanez's BTB series also have neck-through construction. Bolt-on neck construction does not necessarily imply a cheaply made instrument; virtually all traditional Fender designs still use bolt-on necks, including its high-end instruments costing thousands of dollars, and many boutique luthiers such as [[Sadowsky]] build bolt-on basses as well as neck-through instruments.\n\nThe number of frets installed on a bass guitar neck may vary.  The original Fender basses had 20 frets, and most bass guitars have between 20 and 24 frets or fret positions. Instruments with between 24 and 36 frets (2 and 3 octaves) also exist. Instruments with more frets are used by bassists who play bass solos, as more frets gives them additional upper range notes. When a bass has a large number of frets, such as a 36 fret instrument, the bass may have a deeper \"cutaway\" to enable the performer to reach the higher pitches. Like [[electric guitar]]s, fretted basses typically have markers on the fingerboard and on the side of the neck to assist the player in determining where notes and important harmonic points are. The markers indicate the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th fret and 12th fret (the 12th fret being the octave of the open string) and on the octave-up equivalents of the 3rd fret and as many additional positions as an instrument has frets for. Typically, one marker is on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th fret positions and two markers on the 12th fret.\n\nThe long scale necks on Leo Fender's basses\u2014with a [[scale (string instruments)|scale length]] (distance between [[nut (string instrument)|nut]] and [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]]) of {{convert|34|in|mm|0}} \u2014 set the standard for electric basses, although {{convert|30|in|mm|0|adj=on}} \"short scale\" instruments, such as the [[H\u00f6fner 500/1]] \"violin bass\" played by [[Paul McCartney]], and the [[Fender Mustang Bass]] are also common. Short scale instruments use the same E-A-D-G tuning as a regular long scale instrument. Short scale instruments are good choices for bassists with smaller hands, such as children or young teens who are just starting the instrument. While {{convert|35|in|mm|0|adj=on}}, {{convert|35+1/2|in|mm|0|adj=on}}, and {{convert|36|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale lengths were once only available in \"boutique\" instruments, in the 2000s (decade), many manufacturers began offering these \"extra long\" scale lengths. This extra long scale provides a higher string tension, which may yield a more defined, deep tone on the low \"B\" string of five- and six-stringed instruments (or detuned four-string basses).\n\n=== Fretted and fretless basses ===\n\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\n\nAnother design consideration for the bass is whether to use [[fret]]s on the fingerboard. On a fretted bass, the metal frets divide the fingerboard into [[semitone]] divisions (as on an [[electric guitar]] or [[acoustic guitar]]). Fretless basses have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard with the fingers, as with the [[double bass]]. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger. The fretless bass lets players use expressive approaches such as [[glissando]] (sliding up or down in pitch, with all of the pitches in between sounding), and [[vibrato]] (in which the player rocks a finger that is stopping a string to oscillate the pitch slightly). Fretless players can also play [[Microtonal music|microtones]], or temperaments other than [[equal temperament]], such as [[just intonation]].\n\nWhile fretless basses are often associated with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], bassists from other genres have used fretless basses,  such as [[Freebo]] (country), [[Rick Danko]] (rock/blues), [[Rod Clements]] (folk), [[Steve DiGiorgio]], [[Jeroen Paul Thesseling]] (metal), [[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]] (rock), and [[Colin Edwin]] (modern/[[progressive rock]]).  Some bassists alternate between fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material or tunes they are performing, e.g., [[Pino Palladino]] or [[Tony Levin]].\n\nThe first fretless bass guitar was made by [[Bill Wyman]] in 1961 when he converted a used UK-built \u2018Dallas Tuxedo\u2019 bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguitarcollection.org.uk/guitar/dallas-tuxedo-bass/|title=Dallas Tuxedo Bass - The Guitar Collection|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Roberts, Jim (2001).

Tapewound and flatwound strings have a distinctive tone and sound. Some fretless basses have [[epoxy]]-coated fingerboards, or fingerboards made of an epoxy composite like [[micarta]], to increase the fingerboard's durability, enhance [[sustain]], and give a brighter tone.\n\n=== Strings and tuning ===\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\n\n[[File:Bass guitar headstock.jpg|thumb|right|Tuning machines (with spiral metal [[worm gear]]s) are mounted on the back of the headstock on the bass guitar neck]]\n\nThe standard design for the electric bass guitar has four [[string (music)|strings]], tuned E, A, D and G,<ref>http://www.contrabass.com/pages/frequency.html, Referenced February 17, 2015</ref> in fourths such that the open highest string, G, is an eleventh (an octave and a fourth) below [[middle C]], making the tuning of all four strings the same as that of the [[double bass]] (E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>). This tuning is also the same as the standard tuning on the lower-pitched four strings on a six-string guitar, only an octave lower.\n\nThere are a range of different string types including all-metal strings, which are available in many varieties of winding or finishing, each of which produce different tone, including [[roundwound]], [[flatwound]], [[String (music)#Halfwound, ground wound, pressure wound|halfwound, ground wound, and pressure wound]]); as well as metal strings with different coverings, such as tapewound and wound with plastic coatings. The variety of materials used in the strings gives bass players a range of tonal options. In the 1950s and early 1960s, bassists mostly used flatwound strings with a smooth surface, which had a smooth, damped sound reminiscent of a double bass. In the late 1960s and 1970s, players began using roundwound bass strings, which produce a brighter tone similar to steel guitar strings, though flatwounds also remained in use by players seeking a vintage tone. Roundwounds have a brighter [[timbre]] (tone) with longer [[sustain]] than flatwounds.\n\nA variety of tuning options and number of string courses (courses are when strings are put together in groups of two, often at the unison or octave) have been used to extend the range of the instrument, or facilitate different modes of playing, or allow for different playing sounds. The most common are four, five, or six strings:\n\n* '''Four strings''' with alternative tunings to obtain an extended lower range.<ref>Tunings such as ''B\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D'' (this requires a low \"B\" string in addition to the other three \"standard\" strings, and omits the G string), ''[[Drop D tuning|D\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G]]'' (a \"standard\" set of strings, with only the lowest string detuned from E down to D), and ''D\u2013G\u2013C\u2013F'' or ''C\u2013G\u2013C\u2013F'' (a \"standard\" set of strings, all of which are detuned either a whole tone, or a whole tone for the three higher-pitched strings and two tones for the E, which is dropped to a low C) give bassists an extended lower range. A tenor bass tuning of ''A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C'', in which the low E is omitted and a high C is added, provides a higher range.</ref> Tuning in fifths e.g., C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A (like a [[violoncello]] but an octave lower) gives an extended upper and lower range.\n\n[[File:Bassguitarnotes.svg|thumb|400px|Note positions on a right-handed four-string bass in standard E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G tuning (from lowest-pitched string to the highest-pitched string, shown in [[Sharp_(music)|sharps]]), shown up to the 12th fret, where the pattern repeats.

Another common tuning  on early 1970s five-string basses added a high note instead of a low note: E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C, known as ''tenor tuning''. This tuning is still popular among [[jazz]] and solo bassists. Other tunings, such as C\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G are rare. Some bassists like C as the lowest pitch because that's the lowest note on an upright bass with a [[Double_bass#C_extension|C]], and C is a common note in a few popular keys C (e.g., C major, G major, F major). Some players may detune the lowest string to B{{music|b}} or A. B{{music|b}} is common for bassists who play in [[brass band]]s, as B{{music|b}} is an important and common key for this type of ensemble. Relative to a four-string bass, the fifth string provides a greater lower range (with a low B, C, or A) or a greater upper range (with a high C or B is added) and provides more notes for any single hand position. The earliest five string was created by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] in 1965. The [[Fender Bass V]] used the E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C tuning, but was unpopular and discontinued in 1970. The type of low B five-string was created by [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]] as a custom instrument in 1975. He bought an E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C 5-string [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] bass, replaced the nut, and used a new, thick low B string from [[GHS (strings)|GHS]]. [[Steinberger]] made a 5-string headless instrument called the L-2/5 in 1982, and later [[Yamaha]] offered the first production model as the BB5000 in 1984.\n\n[[File:washburn xb600.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Washburn Guitars|Washburn]] XB600, a six string bass]]\n* '''Six strings''' are usually tuned B<sub>0</sub>\u2013E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>\u2013C<sub>3</sub>\u2014like a four-string bass with an additional low B string and a high C string.

While less common than four or five-string basses, they appear in Latin, jazz, and other genres, as well as in studio work where a [[session musician]]'s single instrument must be highly versatile, and to facilitate [[sightreading]] in the [[recording studio]]. Alternative tunings for six-string bass include B\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013B, matching the first five strings of an acoustic or electric guitar with an additional low B, and E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013B\u2013E, completely matching the tuning of a six-string guitar but one octave lower allowing the use of guitar chord fingerings. Rarer tunings such as E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C\u2013F and F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G provide a lower or higher range in a given position while maintaining consistent string intervals. In 1974, [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] worked with [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to create the Contrabass guitar (BEADGC). Later, Jackson brought his ideas to [[Fodera]] and worked with Ken Smith to create a wider-spaced Contrabass guitar, which evolved to the modern six-string bass.\n* '''[[Eight-string bass|Eight]]''' and '''[[Twelve-string bass|twelve-string]]''' models are both built on the same [[course (music)|\"course string\"]] concept found on [[twelve-string guitar]]s, where sets of strings are spaced together in groups of two or three that are primarily played simultaneously.  These instruments typically have one of the strings in each course tuned an octave above the 'standard' string, although a fifth above is also used. Instruments with ten and fifteen strings, grouped in five courses, also exist, as do \"[[extended-range basses]]\" or ERBs with non-coursed string counts rivaling those of coursed-string basses.\n\n[[File:D-Tuner.jpg|thumb|A bass guitar headstock with detuner set to ''D'' position]]\n* '''[[Detuner]]s''', such as the Hipshot, are mechanical devices the player operates with the thumb on the fretting hand to quickly retune one or more strings to a pre-set lower pitch. Hipshots typically drop the E-string down to D on a four-string bass.<ref>Hipshots similarly drop the B-string down to a B{{music|flat}} on five or six string basses\u2014handy when accompanying brass instruments that commonly play in the key of B{{music|flat}} major.</ref> Rarely, some bassists (e.g., [[Michael Manring]]) add detuners to more than one string, or even more than one detuner to each string, so they can retune during a performance and access a wider range of chime-like harmonics.\n\n==== Alternative range approaches ====\n\nSome bassists use other types of tuning to extend the range or get other benefits, such as providing multiple octaves of notes at any given position, or a larger tonal range. Instrument types or tunings used for this purpose include '''basses with fewer than four strings''' (one-string bass guitars,<ref>Japanese manufacturer Atlansia offers one-, two- and three-stringed instruments [http://www.atlansia.jp/BASS.NEW.HTML#P8]</ref> two-string bass guitars, three-string bass guitars [tuned to E\u2013A\u2013D])<ref>Session bassist [[Tony Levin]] commissioned [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] to build a three-string version of his favorite [[Music Man StingRay|Stingray bass]]</ref> and '''alternative tunings''' (e.g., tenor bass).<ref>Tuned A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C, like the top 4 strings of a six-string bass, or simply a standard four-string with the strings each tuned up an additional perfect fourth.

A seven-string bass (B<sub>0</sub>\u2013E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>\u2013C<sub>3</sub>\u2013F<sub>3</sub>) was built by luthier Michael Tobias in 1987. This instrument, commissioned by bassist Garry Goodman, was an early example of a bass with more than six single course strings.

The first electric piccolo bass was constructed by luthier Carl Thompson for [[Stanley Clarke]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} To allow for the raised tuning, the strings are thinner, and the length of the neck (the [[Scale (string instruments)#Electric bass|scale]]) may be shorter. Several companies manufacture piccolo sets that can be put on any regular bass, thereby converting any bass into a piccolo bass. Because of the thinner strings, a new nut may be required to hold the strings. Some people prefer a slightly shorter scale, such as {{convert|30|or|28|in|mm|0}}, as the higher tension required for longer scale lengths coupled with the thinner gauge of higher-pitched strings can make a long-scale piccolo bass difficult to play. The tuning varies with the personal tastes of the artist, as does the number of strings. [[Joey DeMaio]] from the heavy metal band [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]] plays with four strings on his piccolo bass. Jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] used a six-string piccolo bass, unaccompanied, on his song \"Sachi's Eyes\" on his album ''One More Angel''. [[Michael Manring]] has used a five-string piccolo bass in several altered tunings. Michael uses D'Addario EXL 280 piccolo bass strings on his four-string hyperbass, made by [[Zon Guitars]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n=== Alternative neck designs ===\n\n'''Multi-scale fingerboard''' is an alternative design for guitars and bass guitars in which the lower-pitched strings gain more length and the higher-pitched strings get shorter, similar to the string lengths on a grand piano. The reason for the uneven scale length across strings is that it evens out the tension across all of the strings, it evens the timbre across the strings, and extending the lower string scales allows the string to produce harmonics that are more in tune with the fundamental<ref name = Interview with Sheldon Dingwall <ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thedailyfunkclub.com/interviews/sheldon-dingwall/|title=FANNING THE FLAMES WITH SHELDON DINGWALL|author=Andy Irvine|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:Dingwall Prima Artist - Fannet Frets Bass Guitar.jpg|thumb|Dingwall Prima Artist - Fannet Frets Bass Guitar]]\n\nTo keep proper pitch across all frets in a multi-scale bass guitar, a fanned fret design is applied to the fingerboard. In this case, the frets extend from the neck of the instrument at an angle, in contrast to the standard perpendicular arrangement in standard neck designs, in which the fret spacing is wider for the long scale and closer for the short scale.  This is not to be confused with perfect intonation across the whole neck, which is a feature of true temperament frets. Proponents of multi-scale and fanned frets designs also claim benefits such as comfort and better ergonomics<ref> {{citeweb|url=http://novaxguitars.com/info/concept.html|title=Novax Guitars website|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>. \n\n\n'''Torzal Natural Twist''' is a bass guitar body and neck style invented by luthier Jerome Little from Amherst, Massachusetts. It consists of a neck rotated by a total of 35 degrees, with (+)15 degrees at the bridge and (-)20 at the nut.  The designer claims that the ergonomic design increases efficiency of the hands, wrists and arms, which reduces the risk of developing repetitive strain injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis. This design is also beneficial to players who have already suffered from such injuries. This patented design differs from traditional bass guitar design by twisting the neck, and bringing the strings toward a more natural hand position at either end of the instrument. The rotation at either side of the instrument in the direction of the hand creates a neck plane that models the natural motion of the hand as it reaches outward. The fretboard also forms a straight line at the location of each string, which should improve the ease of performance.<ref name=\"Little\" guitar=\"\" works=\"\">{{cite web|url=https://www.torzalguitars.com/natural-twist/|title=Torzal Guitars website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n\nMost electric bass guitars use magnetic pickups. The vibrations of the instrument's ferrous metal strings within the magnetic field of the permanent magnets in magnetic [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]] produce small variations in the magnetic flux threading the coils of the pickups. This in turn produces small electrical voltages in the coils. Many bass players connect the signal from the bass guitar's pickups to a [[bass amplifier]] and loudspeaker using a 1/4\" [[patch cord]]. These low-level signals are then strengthened by the bass amp's [[preamplifier]] electronic circuits, and then amplified with the bass amp's [[power amplifier]] and played through [[speaker enclosure|one or more speaker(s) in a cabinet]].\n\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\nMost basses have a volume [[potentiometer]] (\"pot\" or \"knob\"), which can be turned up or down, and a tone potentiometer, which rolls off the high frequencies when it is turned to the player's right. Some basses may also have a pickup selector control or switch, to select single-coil or humbucking pickups. Since the 1980s, basses are often available with battery-powered \"active\" electronics that boost the signal with a [[preamplifier]] and provide [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies, or both. Some expensive basses have even more equalization options, such as bass, middle and treble.\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (which refers to the Fender Precision Bass), also referred to as \"P pickups\", are two distinct [[single-coil]] pickups. Each is offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pickups are reverse-wound with reversed magnetic polarity to reduce unwanted hum. This makes the 'P' pickup a [[humbucker|humbucking]] single coil pickup. Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, used on the original 1951 Fender Precision bass.<ref>This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.</ref> P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but some luthiers and performers have used P pickups in the bridge position, or in between two jazz pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (referring to the original Fender Jazz Bass), also referred to as \"J pickups\", are wider eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one of them near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-pickups are reverse-wound with reverse magnetic polarity. As a result, they have hum canceling properties when used at the same volume, with hum cancellation decreasing when the pickups are at unequal volume, and absent if the player uses only one pickup. 'J' Style pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than 'P' Style pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck, so they can blend the two sounds.\n\n[[File:Yamaha BB404F Fretless bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Yamaha BB404F, which has two passive single coil pickups]]\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups, sometimes abbreviated to ''DC pickups'', have two signal-producing coils that are reverse-wound around opposed polarity magnets (similar in principle to the two individual J-pickups or the two halves of a modern Precision pickup, only in a single housing). This significantly reduces unwanted noise from electromagnetic interference compared to single coil pickups. Humbuckers also often produce a higher output level than single coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils. Dual coil pickups come in two main varieties; ceramic or ceramic and steel. Ceramic-only magnets have a relatively \"harsher\" sound than their ceramic and steel counterparts, and are thus used more commonly in heavier rock styles ([[heavy metal music]], [[hardcore punk]], etc.).\n** A well-known bass humbucker is the pickup used on the [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] series of basses; it has two coils, each with four large polepieces. This style is known as the '''\"MM\" pickup''' for this reason, and many aftermarket pickup manufacturers (companies that make and sell pickups that you can custom-add to your bass) and custom bass builders incorporate these pickups in their designs. The most common configurations are a single pickup at the bridge, two pickups similar in placement to a Jazz Bass, or an MM pickup at the bridge with a single-coil pickup (often a \"J\") at the neck. These pickups can often be \"tapped\", meaning one of the two coils can be essentially turned off, giving a sound similar to a single-coil pickup.\n* '''\"Soapbar\" Pickups''' are so-named due to their resemblance to a bar of soap and originally referred to the Gibson [[P-90]] guitar pickup. The term is also used to describe any pickup with a rectangular shape (no protruding screw mounting \"ears\" like on P, J or MM pickups) and no visible pole pieces. Most of the pickups falling into this category are humbucking, though a few single-coil soapbar designs exist. They are commonly found in basses designed for the rock and metal genres, such as [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[ESP Guitars]], and [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]], however they are also found on 5- and 6-string basses made popular by jazz and [[jazz fusion]] music, such as Yamaha's TRB and various Peavey model lines. 'Soapbar pickups' are also called 'extended housing pickups', because the rectangular shape is achieved simply by making the pickup cover longer or wider than it would have to be to only cover the pickup coils, and then the mounting holes are recessed inside these wider dimensions of the housing.\n\nMany basses have just one pickup, typically a \"P\" or \"MM\" pickup, though single soapbars are not unheard of. Multiple pickups are also quite common, two of the most common configurations being two \"J\" pickups (as on the stock Fender Jazz), or a \"P\" near the neck and a \"J\" near the bridge (e.g., Fender Precision Bass Special, Fender Precision Bass Plus). A two-\"soapbar\" configuration is also very common, especially on basses by makes such as [[Ibanez]] and [[Yamaha]]. A combination of a J or other single-coil pickup at the neck and a Music Man-style humbucker in the bridge has become popular among boutique instrument builders, giving a very bright, focused tone that is good for jazz, funk and thumbstyle.\n\nSome basses, particularly expensive boutique instruments or custom-made guitars, use more unusual pickup configurations. Examples include a soapbar and a \"P\" pickup (found on some Fender basses), bassist [[Stu Hamm]]'s \"Urge\" basses, which have a \"P\" pickup sandwiched between two \"J\" pickups, and some of funk bassist [[Bootsy Collins]]' custom basses, which had as many as five J pickups. Another unusual pickup configuration is found on some of the custom basses that [[shred guitar|virtuoso bassist]] [[Billy Sheehan]] uses, in which there is one humbucker at the neck and a split-coil pickup at the middle position.\n\nThe placement of the pickup greatly affects the sound, timbre and tone of the instrument. A pickup near the neck joint emphasizes the fundamental and low-order harmonics and thus produces a deeper, bassier sound, while a pickup near the bridge emphasizes higher-order harmonics and makes a \"tighter\" or \"sharper\" sound. Usually basses with multiple pickups allow blending of the output from the pickups, with electrical and acoustical interactions between the two pickups (such as partial phase cancellations) allowing a range of tonal and timbral effects.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\n\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) are non-magnetic pickups that use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] are another type of non-magnetic pickup. They use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, similar to the mechanism of modern computer mice, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies. LightWave Systems builds basses with optical pickups.\n\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification}}\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n\nLike the [[electric guitar]], the electric bass guitar is almost always connected to an [[bass instrument amplification|amplifier and a speaker]] with a [[patch cord]] for live performances. Electric bassists use either a \"combo\" amplifier, which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet, or an amplifier and one or more speaker cabinets (typically stacked, with the amplifier sitting on the speaker cabinets, leading to the term \"half-stack\" for one cabinet setups and \"full stack\" for two).\n\nIn most genres, a \"clean\" bass tone (without any amplifier-induced \"overdrive\" or \"distortion\") is desirable, and so while guitarists often prefer the more desirable distorted tones of tube-transistor amplifiers, bassists commonly use solid-state amplifier circuitry to achieve the necessary high output wattages with less weight than tubes (though smaller tubes can often still be found in the low-power \"preamplifier\" sections of the system, where they provide a warmer, smoother character to the bass tone for relatively little additional weight). A few all-tube bass amplifiers are still available, notably from the [[Ampeg]] brand.\n\nIn some cases, to play the bass through [[Public address system|PA]] amplification, it is plugged into a [[DI unit|''direct box'']] or ''DI'', which routes the signal to the bass amp while also sending the signal directly into a [[mixing console]], and thence to the main and monitor speakers. When a recording of bass is being made, engineers may use a microphone set up in front of the amplifier's speaker cabinet for the amplified signal, a direct box signal that feeds the recording console, or a mix of both.\n\nVarious electronic [[bass effects]] such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and [[wikt:signal|signal]] processors and the configuration of the [[amplifier]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] can be used to alter the basic sound of the instrument. In the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), signal processors such as [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]], [[Distortion (music)|overdrive]] devices (sometimes referred to as \"[[fuzz bass]]\"<ref>The Beatles' 1965 album \"Rubber Soul\" uses the term \"fuzz bass\"</ref>), and [[Audio level compression|compressors]] or [[limiter]]s became increasingly popular. Modulation effects like chorus, flanging, phase shifting, and time effects such as delay and looping are less commonly used with bass than with electric guitar, but they are used in some styles of music.\n\n== Playing techniques ==\n\n=== Sitting or standing ===\n\nMost bass players stand while playing, using a strap over the shoulder to hold the instrument, although sitting is also accepted, particularly in large ensemble settings, such as jazz [[big band]]s or in acoustic genres such as [[folk music]]. Some bassists, such as [[Jah Wobble]], alternate between standing or seated playing. It is a matter of the player's preference as to which position gives the greatest ease of playing and what a [[bandleader]] expects. When sitting, right-handed players can balance the instrument on the right thigh or like classical guitar players, the left. When sitting, no strap is required. Balancing the bass on the left thigh usually positions it in such a way that it mimics the standing position, allowing for less difference between the standing and sitting positions. Balancing the bass on the right thigh provides better access to the neck and fretboard in its entirety, especially the lower-pitched frets.\n\n=== Performing techniques ===\n\n[[File:James Jamerson.jpeg|thumb|right|[[James Jamerson]], influential [[Motown]] era bassist]]\n\nIn contrast to the [[upright bass]] (also called \"double bass\"), the electric bass guitar is played horizontally across the body, like an electric guitar. When the strings are plucked with the fingers ([[pizzicato]]), the index and middle fingers (and sometimes the thumb, ring, and little fingers as well) are used. [[James Jamerson]], an influential bassist from the [[Motown]] era, played intricate bass lines using only his index finger, which he called \"The Hook.\" There are also variations in how a bassist chooses to rest the right-hand thumb (or left thumb in the case of left-handed players). A player may rest his or her thumb on the top edge of one of the pickups or on the side of the fretboard, which is especially common among bassists who have an upright bass influence. Some bassists anchor their thumbs on the lowest string and move it off the lowest string when they need to play on the low string. Alternatively, the thumb can be rested loosely on the strings to mute the unused strings.\n\nThe string can be plucked (or picked) at any point between the bridge and the point where the fretting hand is holding down the string on the fingerboard; different [[timbre]]s (tones) are produced depending on where along the string it is plucked. When plucked closer to the bridge, the string's harmonics are more pronounced, giving a brighter tone. Closer to the middle of the string, these harmonics are less pronounced, giving a more mellow, darker tone.\n\nBassists trying to emulate the sound of a double bass sometimes pluck the strings with their thumb and use [[palm mute|palm-muting]] to create a short, \"thumpy\" tone. [[Monk Montgomery]] (who played in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s [[big band]]) and [[Bruce Palmer]] (who performed with [[Buffalo Springfield]]) use thumb downstrokes. The use of the thumb was acknowledged by early Fender models, which came with a \"thumbrest\" or \"Tug Bar\" attached to the pickguard below the strings. Contrary to its name, this was not used to rest the thumb, but to provide leverage while using the thumb to pluck the strings. The thumbrest was moved above the strings in 1970s models (as a true thumbrest) and eliminated in the 1980s. Nevertheless, some reissued versions of vintage Fender basses in the 2010s do include a thumbrest.\n\n==== Slap and pop ====\n{{Main|Slapping (music)}}\n\n[[File:Typical form of a slapping hand in a bass.jpg|thumb|right|The slap and pop technique]]\n\nThe [[Slapping (music)|slap and pop]] method, or \"thumbstyle\", most associated with [[funk]], uses tones and percussive sounds achieved by striking, thumping, or \"slapping\" a string with the thumb and snapping (or \"popping\") a string or strings with the index or middle fingers. Bassists often interpolate left hand-muted \"[[ghost note]]s\" between the slaps and pops to achieve a rapid percussive effect, and after a note is slapped or popped, the fretting hand may cause other notes to sound by using \"[[hammer-on]]s\", \"[[pull-off]]s\", or a left-hand [[glissando]] (slide). [[Larry Graham]] of [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Graham Central Station]] was an early innovator of the slap style, and [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of [[The Brothers Johnson]] is also credited as an early slap bass player.\n\nSlap and pop style is also used by many bassists in other genres, such as rock (e.g., [[Jean-Jacques Burnel|J J Burnel]] and [[Les Claypool]]), metal (e.g., [[Eric Langlois]], [[Martin Mendez]], [[Reginald Arvizu|Fieldy]] and [[Ryan Martinie]]), and [[jazz fusion]] (e.g., [[Marcus Miller]], [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Alain Caron (bass player)|Alain Caron]]). Slap style playing was popularized throughout the 1980s and early 1990s by pop bass players such as [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] (from [[Level 42]]) and rock bassists such as with [[Pino Palladino]] (currently a member of the [[John Mayer Trio]] and bassist for [[The Who]]),<ref name=\"BassMag1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.bassplayer.com/article/pino-palladino/nov-06/23886 |title = The Master Stylist |last = Jisi |first = Chris |year = 2006 |work = Bass Player Magazine Online Edition |publisher = New Bay Media, LLC |accessdate = December 27, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202181732/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/pino-palladino/nov-06/23886 |archivedate = February 2, 2009 |deadurl = yes |df = mdy-all }}</ref> [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (from the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) and [[Alex Katunich]] (from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]). [[Spank bass]] developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass as a percussion instrument, striking the strings above the pickups with an open palmed hand. Wooten popularized the \"double thump,\" in which the string is slapped twice, on the upstroke and a downstroke (for more information, see [[Classical Thump]]). A rarely used playing technique related to slapping is the use of wooden [[dowel]] \"[[funk fingers]]\", an approach popularized by [[Tony Levin]].\n\n==== Picking techniques ====\n\nA [[Guitar pick|pick]] (or [[plectrum]]) produces a more pronounced attack, for speed, or personal preference. Bass with a pick is primarily associated with [[rock music|rock]] and [[punk rock]], but player in other styles also use them. Jazz bassist [[Steve Swallow]] often plays with a pick,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/steve-swallow-the-jazz-bass-pioneer-meets-iggy-pop/63731|title=Steve Swallow: The Jazz Bass Pioneer Meets Iggy Pop|last=BassPlayer.com|first=Electric & Acoustic Bass Gear, Lessons, News, Video, Tabs and Chords -|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}</ref> while [[Pink Floyd]] bassist [[Roger Waters]] uses one for a heavier tone. [[Mike Gordon]] of [[Phish]] uses a pick while also incorporating slapping techniques into his playing.  Picks can be used with alternating downstrokes and upstrokes, or with all downstrokes for a more consistent attack. The pick is usually held with the index and thumb, with the up-and-down plucking motion supplied by the wrist.\n\nThere are many varieties of picks available, but due to the thicker, heavier strings of the electric bass, bassists tend to use heavier picks than those used for electric guitar, typically ranging from 1.14&nbsp;mm\u20133.00&nbsp;mm (3.00 is unusual). Different materials are used for picks, including plastic, nylon, rubber, and felt, all of which produce different tones. Felt and rubber picks sound closer to a fingerstyle tone.\n\n==== Palm-muting techniques ====\n\nPalm-muting is a widely used bass technique. The outer edge of the palm of the picking hand is rested on the bridge while picking, and \"mutes\" the strings, shortening the sustain time. The harder the palm presses, or the more string area that is contacted by the palm, the shorter the string's sustain. The sustain of the picked note can be varied for each note or phrase. The shorter sustain of a muted note on an electric bass can be used to imitate the shorter sustain and character of an upright bass. Palm-muting is commonly done while using a pick, but can also be done without a pick, as when doing down-strokes with the thumb.\n\nOne prominent example of the pick/palm-muting combination is [[Paul McCartney]], who has used this technique for decades. [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] also uses palm-muting, but often without a pick, using the thumb and first finger to pluck.\n<!-- Please do not add any more pictures of bass players. One highly notable bass player is enough. If we allow more, then soon people will want to add a picture of each of the many players referred to in the article. See talk page for discussion. -->\n\n[[File:Paul McCartney live in Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|Paul McCartney mutes strings with picking hand.]]\n\n==== Fretting techniques ====\n\nThe fretting hand\u2014the left hand for right-handed bass players and right hand for left-handed bass players\u2014presses down the strings to play different notes and shape the tone or timbre of a plucked or picked note. One fretting technique is ''a finger per fret,'' where each finger in the fretting hand plays one fret in a given position, giving the advantage that full chromatic scale of over an octave and a half can be played with no up-down wrist movement. Also, the double bass-style technique can be used for fretting. This technique involves using four fingers in the space of three frets, especially in the lower positions (i.e., the fretting positions closer to the nut, where the space between notes is the widest). When considering the spacing between notes, this is a comfortable distance for the average person's hand size, however it requires more up-down hand movements. The main advantage of the \"''four fingers in three frets'' technique is less tendon strain, leading to a diminished likelihood of [[Repetitive Strain Injury]] (RSI). The image below (of a bassist performing tapping) shows the four-in-three.\n\nA player can use the fretting hand to change a sounded note, either by fully muting it after plucking it, or by partially muting it near the bridge to reduce volume, or make the note fade faster. The fretting hand often mutes strings that are not being played to stop sympathetic vibrations, particularly when the player wants a \"dry\" or \"focused\" sound. On the other hand, the sympathetic resonance of harmonically related strings are sometimes desirable. In these cases, a bassist can fret harmonically related notes. For example, while fretting a sustained \"F\" (on the third fret of the \"D\" string), underneath an F major chord being played by a piano player, a bassist might hold down the \"C\" and low \"F\" below this note so their harmonics sound sympathetically.\n\nThe fretting hand can add [[vibrato]] to a plucked or picked note, either a gentle, narrow vibrato or a more exaggerated, wide vibrato with bigger pitch variations. For fretted basses, vibrato is always an alternation between the pitch of the note and a slightly higher pitch. For fretless basses, the player can use this style of vibrato, or they can alternate between the note and a slightly lower pitch, as is done with the [[double bass]] and on other [[string section|unfretted stringed instruments]]. While vibrato is mostly done on [[stopped note|\"stopped\" notes]]\u2014that is, notes that are pressed down on the fingerboard\u2014open strings can also be vibratoed by pressing down on the string behind the nut. As well, the fretting hand can be used to \"bend\" a plucked or picked note up in pitch, by pushing or pulling the string so that the note sounds at a higher pitch. To create the opposite effect, a \"bend down\", the string is pushed to a higher pitch before being plucked or picked and then allowed to fall to the lower, regular pitch after it is sounded. Though rare, some bassists may use a [[tremolo bar]]-equipped bass to produce the same effect.\n\nIn addition to pressing down one note at a time, bassists can also press down several notes at one time with their fretting hand to perform a [[double stop]] (two notes at once) or a chord. While double stops and chords are used less often by bassists than by electric guitarists playing [[rhythm guitar]], a variety of double stops and chords can be performed on the electric bass. Some double stops used by bassists include [[octave]]s. Chords can be especially with effective on instruments with higher ranges such as six-string basses. Another variation to fully pressing down a string is to gently graze the string with the finger at the [[harmonic]] node points on the string, which creates chime-like upper partials (also called \"overtones\"). [[Glissando]] is an effect in which the fretting hand slides up or down the neck, which can be used to create a slide in pitch up or down. A subtle glissando can be performed by moving the fretting hand without plucking or picking the string; for a more pronounced effect, the string is plucked or picked first, or, in a metal or [[hardcore punk]] context, a pick may be scraped along the sides of the lower strings.\n\n[[File:Bass Guitar Tapping.JPG|thumb|right|The tapping technique]]\n\nThe fretting hand can also be used to sound notes, either by [[pizzicato|plucking an open string]] with the fretting hand, or, in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked, by [[hammer on|\"hammering on\"]] a higher pitch or [[pull off|\"pulling off\"]] a finger to pluck a lower fretted or open stringed note. Jazz bassists use a subtle form of fretting hand pizzicato by plucking a very brief open string [[grace note]] with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the plucking hand. When a string is rapidly hammered on, the note can be prolonged into a [[trill (music)|trill]].\n\n==== Two-handed tapping ====\n\nIn the two-handed [[tapping]] styles, bassists use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Instead of plucking or picking the string to create a sound, in this technique, the action of striking the string against the fret or the fretboard creates the sound. Since two hands can be used to play on the fretboard, this makes it possible to play interweaving [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] lines, to simultaneously play a bass line and a simple chord, or play [[Guitar chord|chords]] and arpeggios. Bassist [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]] tapped percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a twangy sound to create drum-style [[fill (music)|fills]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Players noted for this technique include [[Cliff Burton]], [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Stuart Hamm]], [[John Myung]], [[Victor Wooten]], [[Les Claypool]], [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]], and [[Michael Manring]]. The [[Chapman Stick]] and [[Warr Guitar]]s are string instruments specifically designed to play using two-handed tapping.\n\n==== Strumming ====\n\n[[Strum]]ming, usually with finger nails, is a common technique on [[acoustic guitar]], but it is not a commonly used technique for bass. However, notable examples are [[Stanley Clarke]]'s bass playing on the introduction to \"School Days\", on the [[School Days (album)|album of the same name]]<ref>Rockschool Bass Grade 6 (2012) p 29</ref>, and [[Lemmy]] who was noted for his use of chords, often playing the bass like a rhythm guitar.\n\n==== Chucking ====\n\nThe late [[Bernard Edwards]], bass player with the Disco group [[Chic (band)|Chic]], was known to use a technique called ''chucking'' to pluck the bass strings with the forefinger of his right hand, in a manner similar to how strings are plucked with a plectrum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nile-rodgers-le-freak-book-excerpt|title=\"Le Freak\" by Nile Rodgers Book Excerpt|first=Nile|last=Rodgers|date=October 18, 2011|publisher=}}</ref>{{not in source|date=June 2018}} Chucking uses the soft part of the forefinger and the nail of the forefinger to alternately strike the string in an up-down manner. The thumb supports the forefinger at the first joint, as though using an invisible plectrum. With a flexible wrist action, chucking facilitates rapid rhythmic sequences of notes played on different strings, particular notes that are an octave apart. Chucking is distinguished from plucking in that the attack is softer with a sound closer to that produced by the use of fingers. Chucking allows a mix of plucking and finger techniques on a given song, without having to take up or put down a plectrum.  Examples of Edwards\u2019 use of chucking on his [[Music Man StingRay|Music Man Stingray]] bass can be heard on the intro and solo section of \"[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]\" and the foundation bass line of  \"[[Dance, Dance, Dance: The Best of Chic|Dance Dance Dance]]\".\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Popular and traditional music ===\n\n[[Popular music]] bands and rock groups use the bass guitar as a member of the [[rhythm section]], which provides the [[chord (music)|chord]] sequence or \"[[Chord progression|progression]]\" and sets out the \"[[beat (music)|beat]]\" for the song. The rhythm section typically consists of a [[rhythm guitar]]ist or [[electric keyboard]] player, or both, a bass guitarist and a [[drummer]]; larger groups may add additional guitarists, keyboardists, or percussionists.\n\nBassists often play a bass line composed by an [[arranger]], [[songwriter]] or [[composer]] of a song\u2014or, in the case of a [[cover song]], the bass line from the original. In other bands\u2014e.g., jazz-rock bands that play from [[lead sheet]]s and country bands using the [[Nashville number system]]\u2014bassists are expected to improvise or prepare their own part to fit the song's chord progression and rhythmic style.\n\n[[File:Pop bassline.ogg|thumb|right|A simple pop bass line over a D major progression]]\n\nTypes of bass lines vary widely, depending on musical style. However, the bass guitarist generally fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat in collaboration with the drummer and other [[rhythm section]] instruments. The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part as the music emphasizes vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in [[reggae]], funk, or hip-hop, entire songs may center on the bass groove, and the bass line is usually prominent in the mix.\n\nIn traditional music such as [[country music]], [[folk rock]], and related styles, the bass often plays the roots and fifth (typically the fifth below the root) of each chord in alternation. In these styles, bassists often use scalar \"walkups\" or \"walkdowns\" when there is a chord change. In Chicago [[blues]], the electric bass often performs a [[walking bass]]line made up of scales and arpeggios. In [[blues rock]] bands, the bassist often plays [[blues scale]]-based riffs and chugging [[boogie]]-style lines. In [[heavy metal bass|metal]], the bass guitar may perform complex [[riff]]s along with the rhythm guitarist or play a low, rumbling [[pedal point]] to anchor the group's sound.\n\n[[File:Blues bassline played with a pick.ogg|thumb|right|A blues bass line played with a pick]]\n\nThe bass guitarist sometimes breaks out of the strict rhythm section role to perform [[bass run|bass breaks]] or bass solos. The types of bass lines used for bass breaks or bass solos vary by style. In a rock band, a bass break may consist of the bassist playing a [[riff]] or [[lick (music)|lick]] during a pause in the song. In some styles of metal, a bass break may consist of \"[[shred guitar]]\"-style [[tapping]] on the bass. In a [[funk]] or funk rock band, a bass solo may showcase the bassist's percussive [[slap and pop]] playing. In genres such as [[progressive rock]], [[art rock]], or [[progressive metal]], the bass guitar player may play [[melody]] lines along with the [[lead guitar]] (or vocalist) and perform extended [[guitar solo]]s.\n\nChords are not used that often by electric bass players. However, in some styles, bassists may sound \"double stops\", such as octaves with open strings and powerchords. In Latin music, double stops with fifths are used.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bassmusicianmagazine.com/2013/03/bass-lines-by-jaime-vazquez-adventurous-bass-playing-part-ii |title = Bass Lines by Jaime Vazquez \u2013 Adventurous Bass Playing Part II |author = Jaime Vazquez |work = Bass Musician Mag |accessdate = March 29, 2015 }}</ref> [[Robert Trujillo]] of [[Metallica]] is known for playing \"massive chords\" <ref>Warwick Robert Trujillo Signature Bass.

[[Lemmy]] of [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] often played [[power chord]]s in his bass lines.\n\n=== Solos in metal, funk and progressive rock ===\n\nWhile bass guitar solos are not common in popular music, some artists, particularly in the heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock genres, do use them. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections.\n\nBass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. In the 1960s, [[The Who]]'s bassist, [[John Entwistle]], performed a [[bass run|bass break]] on the song \"[[My Generation (The Who song)|My Generation]]\" using a [[plectrum]]. He originally intended to use his fingers, but could not put his plectrum down quickly enough.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}} This is considered as one of the first bass solos in rock music, and also one of the most recognizable. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\", the first song on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]], contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s bassist, [[John Deacon]], occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song \"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\". [[Metallica]]'s 1983 debut ''[[Kill Em All]]'' includes the song \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]],\" consisting entirely of a bass solo played by [[Cliff Burton]].\n\nThe parody band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] performed ''Big Bottom'' on their album ''[[This Is Spinal Tap (album)|This Is Spinal Tap]]'', where all three sustaining members played a bass solo, with [[Nigel Tufnel]] ([[Christopher Guest]]) credited as \"lead bass\".\n\n[[Manowar]]'s bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] uses special [[piccolo bass]] for his extremely fast bass solos like \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and \"William's Tale\". [[Green Day]] bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] played a bass solo on the song \"Welcome To Paradise\" from the 1994 album ''[[Dookie]]'' and on the song \"Makeout Party\" from the 2012 album ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]''. [[U2]] includes a bass solo most notably on \"[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]\", in which [[Adam Clayton]] uses several playing techniques. Matt Freeman of Rancid performs a very fast, guitar-like bass solo in the song \"Maxwell Murder\". [[Blink-182]]'s \"Voyeur\" has a bass solo, which is featured on both their studio album ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'' & their live album ''[[The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)]]''.\n\nHeavy metal bass players such as [[Geezer Butler]] ([[Black Sabbath]]), [[Alex Webster]] ([[Cannibal Corpse]]), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Blind Illusion]]) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] has made frequent use of bass solos, such as on the instrumental \"[[YYZ (song)|YYZ]]\". In both published [[Van Halen]] concert videos, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists such as [[Larry Graham]] began using slapping and popping techniques for their solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The [[slapping and popping]] technique incorporates a large number of muted (or 'ghost' tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&B, and they are still used by some modern funk and Latin bands.\n\nWhen playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use [[Effects unit|effects]] such as [[fuzz bass]] or a  [[wah-wah pedal]] to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.\n\n=== Jazz and jazz fusion ===\n\nThe electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of [[jazz]]. The [[big band]]s of the 1930s and 1940s [[Swing music|Swing]] era and the small combos of the 1950s [[Bebop]] and [[Hard Bop]] movements all used the [[double bass]]. The electric bass was introduced in some bands in the 1950s and it became prominent during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when rock influences were blended with jazz to create [[jazz-rock fusion]].\n\n[[File:Walkingbass.png|thumb|300px|right|A walking bass line {{audio|Walkingbass twelve-bar blues variation.mid|Play}}]]\n\nThe introduction of the electric bass in jazz fusion, as in the rock world, helped bassists play in high-volume stadium concerts with powerful amplifiers, because it is easier to amplify the electric bass than the double bass (the latter is prone to feedback in high-volume settings). The electric bass has both an accompaniment and a soloing role in [[jazz]]. In accompaniment, the bassist may perform [[walking bass]]lines for traditional tunes and [[jazz standard]]s, playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate the double bass. It is called a  ''walking bass line'' because of the way it rises and falls using scale notes and passing notes.\n\nFor [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] or [[salsa music|salsa]] tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play rapid, syncopated rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove.\n\nIn a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called \"blowing\" in jazz parlance. Whether a jazz bassist is comping (accompanying) or soloing, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and \"timefeel\" that creates a sense of \"[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]\" and \"[[groove (music)|groove]]\". For information on notable jazz bassists, see the [[List of jazz bassists]] article.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Use in contemporary classical music===\n[[Contemporary classical music]] uses both the standard instruments of Western Art music (piano, violin, double bass, etc.) and newer instruments or sound producing devices, ranging from electrically amplified instruments to tape players and radios.\n\nThe electric bass guitar has occasionally been used in contemporary classical music (art music) since the late 1960s. Contemporary composers often obtained unusual sounds or instrumental timbres through the use of non-traditional (or unconventional) instruments or playing techniques. As such, bass guitarists playing contemporary classical music may be instructed to pluck or strum the instrument in unusual ways.\n\nHowever, contemporary classical composers may also write for the bass guitar to get its unique sound, and in particular its precise and piercing attack and timbre. For example, [[Steve Reich]], explaining his decision to score [[2x5 (Reich)|2x5]] for two bass guitars, stated that, \"[With electric bass guitars] you can have interlocking bass lines, which on an acoustic bass, played pizzicato, would be mud.\"<ref>Interview by Ronen Givony, from the sleeve notes of Steve Reich, Double Sextet/2x5, Nonesuch Records (2010).</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Schnittke April 6 1989 Moscow.jpg|thumb|right|Russian and Soviet composer [[Alfred Schnittke]]]]\n\nComposers using electric bass include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] (''Electric Spring 1'', 1966; ''Electric Spring 2'', 1966/70; ''Electric Spring 3'', 1967; and ''Untitled'', 1996); [[Francis Thorne]] (''Liebesrock'' 1968\u201369); [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (Cello Concerto no. 1, 1966/67, rev. 1971/72; ''[[Capriccio for Violin and Orchestra (Penderecki)|Capriccio for Violin and Orchestra]]'', 1967); ''[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]'', 1969; ''Kosmogonia'', 1970; and ''[[Partita (Penderecki)|Partita]]'', 1971); [[Louis Andriessen]] (''Spektakel'', 1970; ''De Staat'', 1972\u20131976; ''Hoketus'', 1976; ''De Tijd'', 1980\u201381; and ''[[De Materie]]'', 1984\u20131988); [[Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen]] (''Symfoni p\u00e5 Rygmarven'', 1966; ''Rerepriser'', 1967; and ''Piece by Piece'', 1968); and [[Irwin Bazelon]] (''Churchill Downs'', 1970).\n\nElectric bass has also been used by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (''[[Mass (Bernstein)|MASS]]'', 1971); [[Dave Brubeck]] (''Truth Has Fallen'', 1971); [[Alfred Schnittke]] ([[Symphony No. 1 (Schnittke)|Symphony No. 1]], 1972); and [[David Amram]] (''En memoria de Chano Pozo'', 1977).\n\nIn the 1980s and beyond, electric bass was used in works by [[Hans Werner Henze]] (''El Rey de Harlem'', 1980; and ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'', 1981), [[Harold Shapero]], ''On Green Mountain (Chaconne after Monteverdi)'', 1957, orchestrated 1981; Alfred Schnittke's [[Symphony No. 3 (Schnittke)|Symphony No. 3]] (1981); [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' (1987) and [[2x5 (Reich)|2x5]] (2008), [[Wolfgang Rihm]] (''Die Eroberung von Mexico'', 1987\u201391), [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]] (''Miserere'', 1989/92), [[Steve Martland]] (''Dance works'', 1993; and ''Horses of Instruction'', 1994), [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (''Aus dem Stundenbuch'', 1991), [[Giya Kancheli]] (''Wingless'', 1993), [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] (''[[I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky]]'', 1995; and ''Scratchband'', 1996/97), [[Michael Nyman]] (various works for the [[Michael Nyman Band]]), [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] (''Blood on the Floor'', 1993\u20131996), numerous works by [[Art Jarvinen]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://leisureplanetmusic.com/composer/jarvinen/comps.htm |title = Music by Arthur Jarvinen |first = Arthur |last = Jarvinen |date =  |website = leisureplanetmusic.com |accessdate = September 5, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== Pedagogy and training ==\n\nThe pedagogy and training for the electric bass varies widely by genre and country. Rock and pop bass has a history of pedagogy dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, when method books were developed to help students learn the instrument. One notable method book was [[Carol Kaye]]'s ''How to Play the Electric Bass''.\n\nIn the jazz scene, since the bass guitar takes on much of the same role as the double bass\u2014laying down the rhythm, and outlining the harmonic foundation\u2014electric bass players have long used both bass guitar methods and jazz double bass method books. The use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques (e.g., how to improvise [[walking bass]]lines) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument.\n\n=== Formal training ===\n\nOf all of the genres, jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&B, etc.) have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training for electric bass. In the jazz scene, teens can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in amateur big bands at high schools or run by the community. Young adults who aspire to be come professional jazz bassists or studio rock bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges and some universities.\n\nSeveral colleges offer electric bass training in the US. The Bass Institute of Technology (BIT) in Los Angeles was founded in 1978, as part of the Musician's Institute. [[Chuck Rainey]] (electric bassist for [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]) was BIT's first director. BIT was one of the earliest professional training program for electric bassists. The program teaches a range of modern styles, including funk, rock, jazz, Latin, and R&B.\n\nThe [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston offers training for electric bass players. Electric bass students get private lessons and there is a choice of over 270 ensembles to play in. Specific electric bass courses include funk/fusion styles for bass; slap techniques for electric bass; fingerstyle R&B; five- and six-string electric bass playing (including performing chords); and how to read bass sheet music.<ref name=\"berklee.edu\">{{cite web |url = http://www.berklee.edu/departments/bass.html |title = BERKLEE &#124; Bass Department |publisher = Berklee.edu |date =  |accessdate = February 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100213150119/http://www.berklee.edu/departments/bass.html |archivedate = February 13, 2010  |deadurl = no }}</ref> Berklee College alumni include [[Jeff Andrews]], [[Victor Bailey (musician)|Victor Bailey]], [[Jeff Berlin]], [[Michael Manring]], and [[Neil Stubenhaus]].<ref name=\"berklee.edu\" /> The Bass Department has two rooms with bass amps for classes and ten private lesson studios equipped with audio recording gear.

In the US, the [[Manhattan School of Music]] has a jazz program leading to B.Mus. and M.Mus degrees that accepts students who play bass (double bass and electric bass), guitar, piano, drums, and melody instruments (e.g., saxophone, trumpet, etc.).\n\nIn the Australian state of Victoria, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority has set out minimum standards for its electric bass students doing their end-of-year Solo performance recital. To graduate, students must perform pieces and songs from a set list that includes Baroque suite movements that were originally written for cello, 1960s Motown tunes, 1970s fusion jazz solos, and 1980s slap bass tunes. A typical program may include a Prelude by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]; \"Portrait of Tracy\" by [[Jaco Pastorius]]; \"[[Twisted (Annie Ross song)|Twisted]]\" by [[Wardell Gray]] and [[Annie Ross]]; \"What's Going On\" by [[James Jamerson]]; and the funky Disco hit \"[[Le Freak]]\" by Chic.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/musicsolo/units34soloworks/sololist/electricbass.pdf |title = Contemporary Double Bass |format = PDF |accessdate = February 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to college and university diplomas and degrees, there are a variety of other training programs such as jazz or funk summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of contemporary music, from 1970s-style jazz-rock fusion to 2000s-style R&B.\n\n=== Informal training ===\n\nIn other less mainstream genres, such as hardcore punk or metal, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are typically not formalized and institutionalized. As such, many players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands. Even in non-mainstream styles, though, students may be able to take lessons from experts in these or other styles, adapting learned techniques to their own style. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., how to play metal bass). In the 2010s, many instructional videos are available online on video-sharing websites such as [[YouTube]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Guitar}}\n\n* [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[Octobass]], an extremely large and rare bass instrument from the violin family used in [[orchestra]]s.\n* [[Range (music)|Range]]\n* [[Washtub bass]]\n\n== Footnotes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book |last = Roberts |first = Jim |title = How The Fender Bass Changed the World |year = 2001 |publisher = Backbeat Books |location = San Francisco, CA |isbn = 0-87930-630-0 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1 = Wheeler |first1 = Tom |year = 1978 |title = The Guitar Book: A Handbook for Electric and Acoustic Guitarists |publisher = [[Harper & Row]] |isbn = 0-06-014579-X }}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite journal |last1 = Bacon |first1 = Tony |last2 = Moorhouse |first2 = Barry |year = 2016 |title = The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher = [[Backbeat Books]] |isbn = 1-4950-0150-4 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1 = Black |first1 = J.

A [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] is worth two points, unless made from behind the [[3 point line|three-point line]], when it is worth three.  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point [[free throw]]s.  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.\n\nPlayers advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots\u2014the [[lay-up]], the [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]], or a [[Slam dunk|dunk]]; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or [[block (basketball)|block]] shots; either offense or defense may collect a [[rebound (basketball)|rebound]], that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.  It is a violation to [[Traveling (basketball)|lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball]], to [[Carrying (basketball)|carry]] it, or to [[double dribble|hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling]].\n\nThe five players on a each side at a time fall into five positions [[Basketball position|player positions]]: the tallest player is usually the [[Center (basketball)|center]], the tallest and strongest is the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], a slightly shorter but more agile big man is the [[small forward]], and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the [[shooting guard]] and the [[point guard]], who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).

Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the \"bounce pass\" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.\n\nThe peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.

By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission.

During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's [[Franklin Wonder Five]], which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.\n\nToday virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in [[Varsity team|varsity]] competition.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120424210910/http://www.nfhs.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=3506 2008\u201309 High School Athletics Participation Survey] NFHS.</ref> Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation.

The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1917 to 1930. The event was organized by [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions.

There were hundreds of men's [[professional basketball]] teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. [[Barnstorm (sports)|Barnstorming]] squads such as the [[Original Celtics]] and two all-African American teams, the [[New York Renaissance|New York Renaissance Five]] (\"Rens\") and the (still existing) [[Harlem Globetrotters]] played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.\n\nIn 1946, the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada between the [[Toronto Huskies]] and [[New York Knicks|New York Knickerbockers]] on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) to form the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|basketball hall of fame]] was founded in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the [[American Basketball Association]], emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the [[ABA-NBA merger]] in 1976. Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.\n\nThe NBA has featured many famous players, including [[George Mikan]], the first dominating \"big man\"; ball-handling wizard [[Bob Cousy]] and defensive genius [[Bill Russell]] of the [[Boston Celtics]]; charismatic center [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who originally played for the barnstorming [[Harlem Globetrotters]]; all-around stars [[Oscar Robertson]] and [[Jerry West]]; more recent big men [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[Karl Malone]]; playmakers [[John Stockton]], [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Steve Nash]]; crowd-pleasing forwards [[Julius Erving]] and [[Charles Barkley]]; European stars [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Pau Gasol]] and [[Tony Parker]]; more recent superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: [[Larry Bird]], [[Magic Johnson|Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson]], and [[Michael Jordan]].\n\nIn 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the [[National Basketball Development League]] (later known as the NBA D-League and then the [[NBA G League]] after a branding deal with [[Gatorade]]).

It was founded as a \"rebellion\" of several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the then-FIBA recognized national association. Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's first season that opened on April 9, 1975.

Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.\n\nFor both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear [[high-top]] sneakers that provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.\n\nA limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.\n\nThe game is controlled by the [[Official (basketball)|officials]] consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouls]], player substitutions, team [[possession arrow]], and the [[shot clock]].\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Basketball (ball)|Basketball court|Backboard (basketball)}}\n<!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. -->\n[[File:Basketball.png|thumb|upright|Traditional eight-panel [[basketball (ball)|basketball]]]]\n\nThe only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.\n\n[[File:Basketball Goal.jpg|thumb|An outdoor basketball net]]\nA regulation [[basketball court]] in international games is {{convert|91.9|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and 49.2 feet (15 meters) wide. In the [[NBA]] and [[NCAA]] the court is {{convert|94|by|50|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}<ref name=\":0\" />. Most courts have [[wood flooring]], usually constructed from [[maple]] planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/430186-what-are-the-different-types-of-basketball-court-surfaces/|title=What Are the Different Types of Basketball Court Surfaces?|first=William|last=Lynch|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/430186-what-are-the-different-types-of-basketball-court-surfaces/|title=What Are the Different Types of Basketball Court Surfaces?|last=|first=|date=February 7, 2014|website=LIVESTRONG|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref> The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.\n\n{{anchor|rim}}The basket is a steel rim {{convert|18|in|cm}} diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures {{convert|6|by|3.5|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and one basket is at each end of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is {{convert|18|in|cm}} high and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly {{convert|10|ft|m|2|abbr=off|sp=us}} above the court and {{convert|4|ft|m|2|abbr=off|sp=us}} inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height \u2013 a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.\n\nThe size of the basketball is also regulated. For men, the official ball is {{convert|29.5|in|cm}} in circumference (size 7, or a \"295 ball\") and weighs 22 oz (623.69 grams). If women are playing, the official basketball size is {{convert|28.5|in|cm}} in circumference (size 6, or a \"285 ball\") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams). In [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.amersports.com/newsroom/archive/news-article/2015/06/09/wilson-to-provide-the-official-game-ball-for-fiba|title=Wilson to provide the Official Game Ball for FIBA |publisher=[[Amer Sports]] |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Violations===\n<!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. -->\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nThe ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).\n\nThe ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.\n\nThere are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as [[traveling (basketball)|traveling]]. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name [[double dribble]]. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying the ball]]. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.\n\nThe ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.\n\nThere are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and [[U Sports]] (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the \"[[key (basketball)|key]]\") (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense.\n\n'''Basket interference''', or '''goaltending''' is a violation charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded. If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.\n\n===Fouls===\n<!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. -->\n[[File:Basketball foul.jpg|thumb|upright|The referee signals that a foul has been committed]]\n{{Main|Personal foul (basketball)|Technical foul}}\nAn attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more [[free throw]]s if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the basket.\n\nThe referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.\n\nThere is a second category of fouls called [[technical foul]]s, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in [[ejection (sports)|disqualification]]. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.\n\nIf a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) \u2013 four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games \u2013 the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made. This is called shooting \"one-and-one\". If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.\n\nWhen a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.\n\nAfter a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be \"in the bonus\". On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading \"Bonus\" or \"Penalty\" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)\n\nIf a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.\n\nIf a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.\n\nIf a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. In combination with a regular shot, this is called a \"three-point play\" or \"four-point play\" (or more colloquially, an \"and one\") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).\n\n==Common techniques and practices==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Positions===\n{{main|Basketball position}}\n[[File:Basketball positions.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Basketball positions in the offensive zone]]\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including [[Mike Krzyzewski]] is towards positionless basketball, where big guys are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it.<ref name=\"Positionless Basketball\">{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Positionless basketball taking hold in college|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0af6adb8a9764142a1dae795bb22d6d3/positionless-basketball-taking-hold-college|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=1 November 2014}}</ref> Popular descriptions of positions include:\n\n[[Point guard]] (often called the \"'''1'''\") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.\n\n[[Shooting guard]] (the \"'''2'''\") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.\n\n[[Small forward]] (the \"'''3'''\") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.\n\n[[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]] (the \"'''4'''\"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in [[man-to-man defense]]).\n\n[[Center (basketball)|Center]] (the \"'''5'''\"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.\n\nThe above descriptions are flexible. For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called '''the wings''', as do the power forward and center, who are often called '''post players.''' While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.\n\n===Strategy===\n{{main|Basketball playbook}}\n\nThere are two main defensive strategies: ''zone defense'' and ''man-to-man defense''. In a [[zone defense]], each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a '''trap'''. In a [[man-to-man defense]], each defensive player guards a specific opponent.\n\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a ''cut''. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a ''[[screen (basketball)|screen]]'' or ''pick''. The two plays are combined in the ''[[pick and roll]]'', in which a player sets a pick and then \"rolls\" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.\n\n===Shooting===\n[[File:Basketball shot.jpg|thumb|upright|Player releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to \"take a charge.\"]]\n\nShooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.\n\nTypically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a ''follow-through''. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\n\n[[File:Basketball through hoop.jpg|thumb|left|Basketball falling through hoop]]\n\nThe two most common shots that use the above described setup are the ''[[set shot (basketball)|set shot]]'' and the ''[[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]''. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances while the jump shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.\n\nAnother common shot is called the ''[[lay-up]]''. This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to \"lay\" the ball \"up\" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a ''[[finger roll]]''). The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the ''[[slam dunk]]'', in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.\n\n[[File:Dunk.gif|thumb|Slow-motion animation of a dunk]]\n\nAnother shot that is becoming common{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} is the \"circus shot\". The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket. A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.\n\nA shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an ''[[air ball]]''. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a [[brick (basketball)|brick]]. The ''hang time'' is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.\n\n===Rebounding===\n{{Main|Rebound (basketball)}}\n[[File:20130103 Offensive Rebound Glenn Robinson III rebound.jpg|upright|thumb|A player making an offensive rebound]]\n<!-- There should be at least a paragraph or two here, in addition to the main article link. -->\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.\n\n===Passing===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:172808 480 art R0.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carlos Arroyo]] shown here with the [[Utah Jazz]], left, passes to a teammate.{{Deletable image-caption|2006-10-16|date=May 2012}} ]] -->\n{{See also|Assist (basketball)}}\nA pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\n\nA staple pass is the ''chest pass''. The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest. A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.\n\nAnother type of pass is the ''bounce pass''. Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.\n\nThe ''overhead pass'' is used to pass the ball over a defender. The ball is released while over the passer's head.\n\nThe ''outlet pass'' occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. The next pass after the rebound is the ''outlet pass''.\n\nThe crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a ''no-look pass''.\n\nAnother advanced style of passing is the ''behind-the-back pass'', which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate. Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.\n\n===Dribbling===\n[[File:Basketball-Basic Types of Dribbling.webm|thumb|right|upright=1.45|A demonstration of the basic types of dribbling in basketball]]\n[[File:Basketball game.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Naval Academy (\"Navy\") player, left, posts up a U.S. Military Academy (\"Army\") defender.]]\n{{Main|Dribble}}\nDribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand, and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.\n\nWhen dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.\n\nGood dribblers (or \"ball handlers\") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to \"steal\" the ball. Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.\n\nA skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or [[peripheral vision]] to keep track of the ball's location. By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.\n\n===Blocking===\n{{Main|Block (basketball)}}\nA block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as ''[[goaltending]]''. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.\n\nTo block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking. Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.\n\n==Height==\nAt the professional level, most male players are above {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|2}} and most women above {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m|2}}. Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players. Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|2}} or taller. Most centers are over {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|2}} tall. According to a survey given to all NBA teams,{{when|date=July 2015}} the average height of all NBA players is just under {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|2}}, with the average weight being close to {{convert|222|lb|kg}}.

[[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]] was just {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}} tall, but had a {{convert|42|in|m|adj=on}} vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping. While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.\n\nIt should be noted that players regularly inflate their height. Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players. Charles Barkley stated; \"I've been measured at 6-5, 6-4 \u00be. But I started in college at 6-6.\" Sam Smith, former writer from [[The Chicago Tribune]], said: \"We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out. But you use that height, and the player gets mad. And then you hear from his agent. Or you file your story with the right height, and the copy desk changes it because they have the 'official' N.B.A. media guide, which is wrong. So you sort of go along with the joke.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/sports/basketball/22score.html</ref> In the NBA, there is no standard on whether a player's listed height uses their measurement with shoes on or without.

During the entire 1996\u201397 season, only three NBA teams did not field an American-born white; on the opening day of the 2016\u201317 season, eight teams did not have a [[white American]] on their roster, and an additional 10 teams had only one. At the latter point in time, fewer than 10% of NBA players were American-born whites (43 out of a possible 450).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/white-american-nba-players/ |title=Where Are All the White American NBA Players? |first=Marc J. |last=Spears |publisher=[[The Undefeated (website)|The Undefeated]] |date=October 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThese proportions have been suggested to be the result of basketball's relatively minor importance in white American culture.

Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.\n\nThere are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including [[Wheelchair basketball]], [[Water basketball]], [[Beach Basketball|Beach basketball]], [[Slamball]], [[Streetball]] and [[Unicycle]] basketball. An earlier version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was [[Six-on-six basketball]]. [[Horseball]] is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m\u00d71.5m). The sport is like a combination of [[polo]], [[rugby football|rugby]], and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as [[Donkey basketball]], but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.\n\n[[File:MECVOLLEYBALL GROUND.JPG|right|thumb|A basketball court in [[Tamil Nadu]], India ]]\n\n;Half-court: Perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the '''half-court''' game, played in informal settings without referees or strict rules. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be \"taken back\" or \"cleared\" \u2013 passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other. Half-court games require less [[cardiovascular]] stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court. Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.\n\n:Half-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3. The latter variation is gradually gaining official recognition as '''[[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]]''', originally known as FIBA 33. It was first tested at the [[2007 Asian Indoor Games]] in [[Macau]] and the first official tournaments were held at the [[2009 Asian Youth Games]] and the [[2010 Youth Olympics]], both in Singapore.

Dunk Ball) is a variation of the game of basketball, played on basketball hoops with lowered (under basketball regulation 10 feet) rims. It originated when the popularity of the slam dunk grew and was developed to create better chances for dunks with lowered rims and using altered [[goaltending]] rules.\n\n;Slamball: Slamball is full-contact basketball, with [[trampolines]]. Points are scored by playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified. The main differences from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and [[backboard (basketball)|backboard]] are four trampolines set into the floor, which serve to propel players to great heights for [[slam dunk]]s. The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams.\n\n;Streetball: Streetball is a less formal variant of basketball, played on [[playground]]s and in gymnasiums across the world. Often only one half of the court is used, but otherwise the rules of the game are very similar to those of basketball. The number of participants in a game, or a ''run'', may range from one defender and one person on offense (known as ''one on one'') to two full teams of five each. Streetball is a very popular game worldwide, and some cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, such as [[midnight basketball]]. Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments.\n\n;{{visible anchor|Unicycle Basketball}}: Unicycle basketball is played using a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with the same rules, for example, one must dribble the ball while riding. There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well, for example, a player must have at least one foot on a pedal when in-bounding the ball. Unicycle basketball is usually played using 24\" or smaller unicycles, and using plastic pedals, both to preserve the court and the players' shins. In North America, popular unicycle basketball games are organized.<ref>[http://bayarea.comcastsportsnet.com/UncoveredVid.jsp?bcpid=1274025926&bclid=1313706243&bctid=1432781480 Comcast SportsNet Feature about Berkeley Unicycle Basketball]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n[[Variations of basketball#More distantly related games|Spin-offs from basketball]] that are now separate sports include:\n* '''[[Ringball]]''', a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball, has been played since 1907.

It is used in [[ball game]]s, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or [[juggling]]. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in [[engineering]] applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as [[ball bearings]]. [[Black powder|Black-powder]] weapons use stone and metal balls as [[projectile]]s.\n\nAlthough many types of balls are today made from [[rubber]], this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. The Spanish were the first Europeans to see bouncing rubber balls (albeit solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.\n\nAs balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word \"ball\" may be used to refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects.\n\n\"Ball\" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, we make a ball with our fist. \n\n== Etymology ==\nThe first known use of the word ''ball'' in English in the sense of a globular body that is played with was in 1205 in ''{{lang|la|[[La\u021damon's Brut, or Chronicle of Britain]]}}'' in the phrase, \"{{lang|la|Summe heo driuen balles wide \u021deond \u00dea feldes.}}\" The word came from the [[Middle English]] ''bal'' (inflected as ''ball-e, -es'', in turn from [[Old Norse]] ''b\u00f6llr'' (pronounced {{IPA-non|b\u0254l\u02d0r|}}; compare Old Swedish ''baller'', and Swedish ''boll'') from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''ballu-z'' (whence probably Middle High German ''bal, ball-es'', Middle Dutch ''bal''), a [[cognate]] with [[Old High German]] ''ballo, pallo'', Middle High German balle from Proto-Germanic ''*ballon'' (weak masculine), and Old High German ''ball\u00e2, pall\u00e2'', Middle High German ''balle'', Proto-Germanic ''*ball\u00f4n'' (weak feminine). No Old English representative of any of these is known. (The answering forms in Old English would have been ''beallu, -a, -e''\u2014compare ''bealluc, ballock''.) If ''ball-'' was native in Germanic, it may have been a cognate with the Latin ''foll-is'' in sense of a \"thing blown up or inflated.\" In the later Middle English spelling ''balle'' the word coincided graphically with the French ''balle'' \"ball\" and \"bale\" which has hence been erroneously assumed to be its source. French ''balle'' (but not ''boule'') is assumed to be of Germanic origin, itself, however. In [[Ancient Greek]] the word \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (''palla'') for \"ball\" is attested<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Flla&highlight=ball \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924204511/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=pa%2Flla&highlight=ball |date=2015-09-24 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> besides the word \"\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\", ''[[sphere]]''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^&highlight=ball \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052243/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3Dsfai%3Dra%5E&highlight=ball |date=2017-03-20 }},  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Russian balls 12-13.jpg|thumb|Russian leather balls ({{Lang-ru|\u043c\u044f\u0447\u0438}}), 12th-13th century.]]\nA ball, as the essential feature in many forms of gameplay requiring physical exertion, must date from the very earliest times. A rolling object appeals not only to a [[human baby]] but to a [[kitten]] and a [[puppy]]. Some form of game with a ball is found portrayed on [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] monuments, and is played among aboriginal tribes at the present day. In [[Homer]], [[Nausicaa]] was playing at ball with her maidens when [[Odysseus]] first saw her in the land of the [[Phaeacia]]ns (Od. vi. 100). And Halios and Laodamas performed before [[Alcinous]] and Odysseus with ball play, accompanied with dancing (Od. viii. 370).\n\n===Ancient Greeks===\nAmong the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], games with balls (\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9) were regarded as a useful subsidiary to the more violent athletic exercises, as a means of keeping the body supple, and rendering it graceful, but were generally left to boys and girls. Of regular rules for the playing of ball games, little trace remains, if there were any such. The names in Greek for various forms, which have come down to us in such works as the \u1f48\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd of [[Julius Pollux]], imply little or nothing of such; thus, \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 (''aporraxis'') only means the putting of the ball on the ground with the open hand, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 (''ourania''), the flinging of the ball in the air to be caught by two or more players; \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 (''phaininda'') would seem to be a game of catch played by two or more, where feinting is used as a test of quickness and skill. Pollux (i. x. 104) mentions a game called [[episkyros]] (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), which has often been looked on as the origin of football. It seems to have been played by two sides, arranged in lines; how far there was any form of \"goal\" seems uncertain.<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ball}}</ref> It was impossible to produce a ball that was perfectly spherical;<ref name=\"Garland2008\">{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Robert|date=2008|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-R1PmAEACAAJ&dq=Ancient+Greece:+Everyday+Life+in+the+Birthplace+of+Western+Civilization&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHhsfWwr7dAhWnxYMKHW20A9cQ6AEIJzAA|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=96|ref=harv}}</ref> children usually made their own balls by inflating pig's bladders and heating them in the ashes of a fire to make them rounder.<ref name=\"Garland2008\"/>\n\n===Ancient Romans===\nAmong the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], ball games were looked upon as an adjunct to the bath, and were graduated to the age and health of the bathers, and usually a place (sphaeristerium) was set apart for them in the baths (thermae). There appear to have been three types or sizes of ball, the [[Pila (ball)|pila]], or small ball, used in catching games, the [[Paganica (ball game)|paganica]], a heavy ball stuffed with feathers, and the [[Follis (ball game)|follis]], a leather ball filled with air, the largest of the three. This was struck from player to player, who wore a kind of [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] on the arm. There was a game known as [[Trigon (game)|trigon]], played by three players standing in the form of a triangle, and played with the follis, and also one known as [[harpastum]], which seems to imply a \"scrimmage\" among several players for the ball. These games are known to us through the Romans, though the names are Greek.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\n===Modern ball games===\nThe various modern games played with a ball or balls and subject to rules are treated under their various names, such as [[polo]], [[cricket]], [[football]], etc.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\n== Round balls ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Football Pallo valmiina-cropped.jpg|[[Football (association football)|Football]] from association football (soccer)\nFile:\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0431\u043e\u043b.jpg|[[Handball]]\nFile:Bandy ball (Orange).JPG|[[Bandy ball]]\nFile:Baseball (crop).jpg|[[Baseball (ball)|Baseball]]\nFile:Basketball.png|[[Basketball (ball)|Basketball]]\nFile:Billiards balls.jpg|[[Billiard ball]]s\nFile:Ball and pin.jpg|[[Bowling ball]] (and [[bowling pin|pin]])\nFile:Cricket-ball-red-madeinaustralia.jpg|[[Cricket ball]]\nFile:Golfball.jpg|[[Golf ball]] next to a hole\nFile:Brine lax ball.jpg|[[Lacrosse ball]]\nFile:Rink bandy ball.JPG|[[Rinkball]]\nFile:Roller-hockey-(Quad)-Ball.jpg|[[Roller hockey|Roller hockey ball]]\nFile:Green_Rubber_Band_Ball.jpg|[[Rubber band ball]]\nFile:Squash Ball Dunlop Revelation Pro 1.jpg|[[Squash (sport)|Squash ball]]\nFile:Assortment of 40 mm table tennis balls.jpg|[[Table tennis ball]]s\nFile:Tennis_ball_01.jpg|[[Tennis ball]]\nFile:Volleyball.jpg|[[Volleyball (ball)|Volleyball]]\nFile:NewWaterPoloBall.JPG|[[Water polo ball]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Prolate spheroid balls ==\nSeveral sports use a ball in the shape of a [[prolate spheroid]]:\n<gallery>\nFile:Wilson American football.jpg|[[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|American football]]\nFile:Sherrin.png|[[Australian rules football]]\nFile:Canadian football.png|[[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|Canadian football]]\nFile:Rugbyball2.jpg|[[Rugby union ball]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ball (mathematics)]]\n* [[Buckminster Fullerene]]\n* [[Football (ball)]]\n* [[Kickball]]\n* [[Marbles]]\n* [[Penny floater]]\n* [[Prisoner Ball]]\n* [[Shuttlecock]]\n* [[Super Ball]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Balls| ]]", "sha1": "i5br9s61rib32cjz0fazm53fpmh0ywz"}}, {"title": "Binary relation", "ns": "0", "id": "3931", "revision": {"id": "858543813", "parentid": "858391443", "timestamp": "2018-09-07T23:17:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Suelru", "id": "20035630"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Combining hatnotes that redirect to the same page.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Relation (mathematics)|a more general notion of relation|finitary relation|other uses|Relation (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''binary relation''' on a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is a set of [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''A''. In other words, it is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''A''<sup>2</sup> = {{nowrap|''A'' \u00d7 ''A''}}. More generally, a binary relation between two sets ''A'' and ''B'' is a subset of {{nowrap|''A'' \u00d7 ''B''}}. The terms '''correspondence''', '''dyadic relation''' and '''2-place relation''' are synonyms for binary relation.\n\nAn example is the \"[[divides]]\" relation between the set of [[prime number]]s '''P''' and the set of [[integer]]s '''Z''', in which every prime ''p'' is associated with every integer ''z'' that is a [[divisibility|multiple]] of ''p'' (but with no integer that is not a multiple of ''p'').  In this relation, for instance, the prime 2 is associated with numbers that include \u22124, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 is associated with numbers that include 0, 6, and 9, but not 4 or 13.\n\nBinary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model concepts like \"[[inequality (mathematics)|is greater than]]\", \"[[Equality (mathematics)|is equal to]]\", and \"divides\" in [[arithmetic]], \"[[Congruence (geometry)|is congruent to]]\" in [[geometry]], \"is adjacent to\" in [[graph theory]], \"is [[orthogonal]] to\" in [[linear algebra]] and many more. A [[function (mathematics)|function]] may be defined as a special kind of binary relation. Binary relations are also heavily used in [[computer science]].\n\nA binary relation is the special case {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 2}} of an [[finitary relation|''n''-ary relation]] ''R''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''A''<sub>''n''</sub>, that is, a set of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s where the ''j''th component of each ''n''-tuple is taken from the ''j''th domain ''A''<sub>''j''</sub> of the relation. An example for a ternary relation on '''Z'''&times;'''Z'''&times;'''Z''' is \" ... lies between ... and ...\", containing e.g. the triples {{nobreak|(5,2,8)}}, {{nobreak|(5,8,2)}}, and {{nobreak|(\u22124,9,\u22127)}}.\n\nA binary relation on ''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' is an element in the [[power set]] on ''A'' \u00d7 ''B''. Since the latter set is ordered by [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] (\u2282), each relation has a place in the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of subsets of ''A'' \u00d7 ''B''.\n\nIn some systems of [[axiomatic set theory]], relations are extended to [[class (mathematics)|classes]], which are generalizations of sets.  This extension is needed for, among other things, modeling the concepts of \"is an element of\" or \"is a subset of\" in [[set theory]], without running into logical inconsistencies such as [[Russell's paradox]].\n\n==Formal definition==\nA '''binary [[finitary relation|relation]]''' ''R'' between arbitrary [[set (mathematics)|set]]s (or [[class (set theory)|class]]es) ''X'' (the '''set of departure''') and ''Y'' (the '''set of destination''' or '''[[codomain]]''') is specified <!-- or given? --> by its '''[[graph of a relation|graph]]''' ''G'', which is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' \u00d7 ''Y''. The binary relation ''R'' itself is usually identified with its graph ''G'', but some authors define it as an ordered triple {{nowrap|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}}, which is otherwise referred to as a '''[[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]]'''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedic dictionary of Mathematics |publisher=MIT |pages=1330\u20131331 |year=2000 |isbn=0-262-59020-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=azS2ktxrz3EC&pg=PA1331&hl=en&sa=X&ei=glo6T_PmC9Ow8QPvwYmFCw&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&f=false }}</ref>\n\nThe statement {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''G''}} is read \"''x'' '''is''' ''R'''''-related to''' ''y''\", and is denoted by ''xRy'' or {{nowrap|''R''(''x'', ''y'').}}  The latter notation corresponds to viewing ''R'' as the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset ''G'' of {{nowrap|''X'' \u00d7 ''Y'',}} i.e. {{nowrap|''R''(''x'', ''y'')}} equals to 1 (true), if {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''G'',}} and 0 (false) otherwise.\n\nThe order of the elements in each pair of ''G'' is important:  if ''a'' \u2260 ''b'', then ''aRb'' and ''bRa'' can be true or false, independently of each other. Resuming the above example, the prime 3 divides the integer 9, but 9 doesn't divide 3.\n\nThe '''[[domain of a function|domain]]''' of ''R'' is the set of all ''x'' such that ''xRy'' for at least one ''y''. The '''[[image (mathematics)|range]]''' of ''R'' is the set of all ''y'' such that ''xRy'' for at least one ''x''. The '''field''' of ''R'' is the union of its domain and its range.<ref name=\"suppes\"/><ref name=\"smullyan\"/><ref name=\"levy\"/>\n\n===Is a relation more than its graph?===\n\n{{Misleading|section|date=September 2015}} \nAccording to the definition above, two relations with identical [[graph of a relation|graph]]s but different domains or different codomains are considered different.  For example, if <math>G = \\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,7)\\}</math>, then <math>(\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Z}, G)</math>, <math>(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{N}, G)</math>, and <math>(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{R}, G)</math> are three distinct relations, where <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math> is the set of [[integer]]s, <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> is the set of [[real number]]s and <math>\\mathbb{N}</math> is the set of [[natural number]]s.\n\nEspecially in [[set theory]], binary relations are often defined as sets of ordered pairs, identifying binary relations with their graphs. The domain of a binary relation <math>R</math> is then defined as the set of all <math>x</math> such that there exists at least one <math>y</math> such that <math>(x,y) \\in R</math>, the '''range''' of <math>R</math> is defined as the set of all <math>y</math> such that there exists at least one <math>x</math> such that <math>(x,y) \\in R</math>, and the '''field''' of <math>R</math> is the union of its domain and its range.<ref name=\"suppes\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Axiomatic Set Theory\n|last=Suppes\n|first=Patrick\n|authorlink=Patrick Suppes\n|publisher=Dover\n|year=1972\n|origyear=originally published by D. van Nostrand Company in 1960\n|isbn=0-486-61630-4\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"smullyan\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Set Theory and the Continuum Problem\n|last=Smullyan\n|first=Raymond M.\n|authorlink=Raymond Smullyan\n|last2=Fitting\n|first2=Melvin\n|publisher=Dover\n|year=2010\n|origyear=revised and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1996 by Oxford University Press, New York\n|isbn=978-0-486-47484-7\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"levy\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Basic Set Theory\n|last=Levy\n|first=Azriel\n|authorlink=Azriel Levy\n|publisher=Dover\n|year=2002\n|origyear=republication of the work published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg and New York in 1979\n|isbn=0-486-42079-5\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA special case of this difference in points of view applies to the notion of [[function (mathematics)|function]].  Many authors insist on distinguishing between a function's [[codomain]] and its [[range (mathematics)|range]]. Thus, a single \"rule,\" like mapping every real number ''x'' to ''x''<sup>2</sup>, can lead to distinct functions <math>f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math> and <math>f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^+</math>, depending on whether the images under that rule are understood to be reals or, more restrictively, non-negative reals.  But others view functions as simply sets of ordered pairs with unique first components.  This difference in perspectives does raise some nontrivial issues.  As an example, the former camp considers [[surjection|surjectivity]]\u2014or being onto\u2014as a property of functions, while the latter sees it as a relationship that functions may bear to sets.\n\nEither approach is adequate for most uses, provided that one attends to the necessary changes in language, notation, and the definitions of concepts like [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]]s, [[composition of relations|composition]], [[converse relation]], and so on.  The choice between the two definitions usually matters only in very formal contexts, like [[category theory]].\n\n===Example===\n<!--WE MUST GET A GOOD PICTURE TO GO WITH THIS EXAMPLE-->\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+ 2nd example relation\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | ball\n! scope=\"col\"        | car\n! scope=\"col\"               | doll\n! scope=\"col\"                      | gun\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | John  \n| '''+''' ||   \u2212   ||   \u2212   ||  \u2212\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mary  \n|   \u2212   ||   \u2212   || '''+''' ||  \u2212\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Venus \n|   \u2212   || '''+''' ||   \u2212   ||  \u2212\n|}\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+ 1st example relation\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | ball\n! scope=\"col\"        | car\n! scope=\"col\"               | doll\n! scope=\"col\"                      | gun\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | John  \n| '''+''' ||   \u2212   ||   \u2212   ||  \u2212\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mary  \n|   \u2212   ||   \u2212   || '''+''' ||  \u2212\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ian   \n|   \u2212   ||   \u2212   ||   \u2212   ||  \u2212\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Venus \n|   \u2212   || '''+''' ||   \u2212   ||  \u2212\n|}\n\nExample: Suppose there are four objects {ball, car, doll, gun} and four persons {John, Mary, Ian, Venus}.  Suppose that John owns the ball, Mary owns the doll, and Venus owns the car.  Nobody owns the gun and Ian owns nothing. Then the binary relation \"is owned by\" is given as\n: ''R'' = ({ball, car, doll, gun}, {John, Mary, Ian, Venus}, {(ball, John), (doll, Mary), (car, Venus)}).\n\nThus the first element of R is the set of objects, the second is the set of persons, and the last element is a set of ordered pairs of the form (object, owner).\n\nThe pair (ball, John), denoted by <sub>ball</sub>''R''<sub>John</sub> means that the ball is owned by John.\n\nTwo different relations could have the same graph.  For example: the relation\n: ({ball, car, doll, gun}, {John, Mary, Venus}, {(ball, John), (doll, Mary), (car, Venus)})\nis different from the previous one as everyone is an owner.  But the graphs of the two relations are the same.\n\nNevertheless, ''R'' is usually identified or even defined as G(''R'') and \"an ordered pair (''x'', ''y'') \u2208 G(''R'')\" is usually denoted as \"(''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''R''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/df-br.html|title=df-br (Metamath Proof Explorer)|last=Megill|first=Norman|date=5 August 1993|access-date=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Special types of binary relations==\n<!-- [[functional relation]] redirects to this section -->\n[[File:Graph of non-injective, non-surjective function (red) and of bijective function (green).gif|thumb|Example relations between real numbers.

The order of ''R'' and ''S'' in the notation ''S''&thinsp;\u2218&thinsp;''R'', used here agrees with the standard notational order for [[composition of functions]]. For example, the composition \"is mother of\" \u2218 \"is parent of\" yields \"is maternal grandparent of\", while the composition \"is parent of\" \u2218 \"is mother of\" yields \"is grandmother of\".\n\n<!---This definition is needed by the closure def.s, too, but maybe should better given in an earlier section(?):--->\nA relation ''R'' on sets ''X'' and ''Y'' is said to be '''contained''' in a relation ''S'' on ''X'' and ''Y'' if ''R'' is a [[subset]] of ''S'', that is, if ''x'' ''R'' ''y'' always implies ''x'' ''S'' ''y''. In this case, if ''R'' and ''S'' disagree, ''R'' is also said to be '''smaller''' than ''S''. For example, > is contained in \u2265.\n\nIf ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Y'', then the following is a binary relation over ''Y'' and ''X'':\n* '''[[converse relation|Converse]]''': ''R''&nbsp;<sup>T</sup>, defined as ''R''&nbsp;<sup>T</sup> = {&thinsp;(''y'', ''x'')&thinsp;|&thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') \u2208 ''R''&thinsp;}. A binary relation over a set is equal to its converse if and only if it is symmetric. See also [[duality (order theory)]]. For example, \"is less than\" (<) is the converse of \"is greater than\" (>).\nIf ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'', then each of the following is a binary relation over ''X'':\n* '''Reflexive closure''': ''R''&thinsp;<sup>=</sup>, defined as ''R''&thinsp;<sup>=</sup> = {&thinsp;(''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' \u2208 ''X''&thinsp;} \u222a ''R'' or the smallest reflexive relation over ''X'' containing ''R''. This can be proven to be equal to the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all reflexive relations containing ''R''.\n* '''Reflexive reduction''': ''R''&thinsp;<sup>\u2260</sup>, defined as ''R''&thinsp;<sup>\u2260</sup> = ''R'' \\ {&thinsp;(''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' \u2208 ''X''&thinsp;} or the largest [[irreflexive]] relation over ''X'' contained in ''R''.\n* '''[[Transitive closure]]''': ''R''&thinsp;<sup>+</sup>, defined as the smallest transitive relation over ''X'' containing ''R''. This can be seen to be equal to the intersection of all transitive relations containing ''R''.\n* '''Reflexive transitive closure''': ''R''&thinsp;*, defined as ''R''&thinsp;* = (''R''&thinsp;<sup>+</sup>)&thinsp;<sup>=</sup>, the smallest [[preorder]] containing ''R''.\n* '''[[Reflexive transitive symmetric closure]]''': ''R''&thinsp;<sup>\u2261</sup>, defined as the smallest [[equivalence relation]] over ''X'' containing ''R''.\n\n===Complement===\nIf ''R'' is a binary relation over ''X'' and ''Y'', then the following too:\n*The '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' ''S'' is defined as ''x'' ''S'' ''y'' if not ''x'' ''R'' ''y''. For example, on real numbers, \u2264 is the complement of >.\n\nThe complement of the inverse is the inverse of the complement.\n\nIf ''X'' = ''Y'', the complement has the following properties:\n*If a relation is symmetric, the complement is too.\n*The complement of a reflexive relation is irreflexive and vice versa.\n*The complement of a [[strict weak order]] is a total preorder and vice versa.\n\nThe complement of the inverse has these same properties.\n\n===Restriction===\nThe [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of a binary relation on a set ''X'' to a subset ''S'' is the set of all pairs (''x'', ''y'') in the relation for which ''x'' and ''y'' are in ''S''.\n\nIf a relation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[total relation|total]], [[Binary relation#Relations over a set|trichotomous]], a [[partial order]], [[total order]], [[strict weak order]], [[Strict weak order#Total preorders|total preorder]] (weak order),  or an [[equivalence relation]], its restrictions are too.\n\nHowever, the transitive closure of a restriction is a subset of the restriction of the transitive closure, i.e., in general not equal.\nFor example, restricting the relation \"''x'' is parent of ''y''\" to females yields the relation \"''x'' is mother of the woman ''y''\"; its transitive closure doesn't relate a woman with her paternal grandmother. On the other hand, the transitive closure of \"is parent of\" is \"is ancestor of\"; its restriction to females does relate a woman with her paternal grandmother.\n\nAlso, the various concepts of [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] (not to be confused with being \"total\") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, on the set of [[real number]]s a property of the relation \"\u2264\" is that every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of '''R''' with an [[upper bound]] in '''R''' has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in '''R'''. However, for a set of rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation \"\u2264\" to the set of rational numbers.\n\nThe ''left-restriction'' (''right-restriction'', respectively) of a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' to a subset ''S'' of its domain (codomain) is the set of all pairs (''x'', ''y'') in the relation for which ''x'' (''y'') is an element of ''S''.\n\n==Sets versus classes==\nCertain mathematical \"relations\", such as \"equal to\", \"member of\", and \"subset of\", cannot be understood to be binary relations as defined above, because  their domains and codomains cannot be taken to be sets in the usual systems of [[axiomatic set theory]].  For example, if we try to model the general concept of \"equality\" as a binary relation =, we must take the domain and codomain to be the \"class of all sets\", which is not a set in the usual set theory.\n\nIn most mathematical contexts, references to the relations of equality, membership and subset are harmless because they can be understood implicitly to be restricted to some set in the context.  The usual work-around to this problem is to select a \"large enough\" set ''A'', that contains all the objects of interest, and work with the restriction =<sub>''A''</sub> instead of =.  Similarly, the \"subset of\" relation \u2286 needs to be restricted to have domain and codomain ''P''(''A'') (the  power set of a specific set ''A''):  the resulting set relation can be denoted \u2286<sub>''A''</sub>.  Also, the \"member of\" relation needs to be restricted to have domain ''A'' and codomain ''P''(''A'') to obtain a binary relation \u2208<sub>''A''</sub> that is a set. Bertrand Russell has shown that assuming \u2208 to be defined on all sets leads to a [[Russell's paradox|contradiction]] in naive set theory.\n\nAnother solution to this problem is to use a set theory with proper classes, such as [[Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory|NBG]] or [[Morse\u2013Kelley set theory]], and allow the domain and codomain (and so the graph) to be [[proper class]]es:  in such a theory, equality, membership, and subset are binary relations without special comment.  (A minor modification needs to be made to the concept of the ordered triple (''X'', ''Y'', ''G''), as normally a proper class cannot be a member of an ordered tuple; or of course one can identify the function with its graph in this context.)<ref>{{cite book |title=A formalization of set theory without variables |last1=Tarski |first1=Alfred |authorlink=Alfred Tarski|last2=Givant |first2=Steven |year=1987 |page=3 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=0-8218-1041-3}}</ref>   With this definition one can for instance define a function relation between every set and its power set.\n\n==The number of binary relations==\nThe number of distinct binary relations on an ''n''-element set is 2<sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup> {{OEIS|id=A002416}}:\n{{number of relations}}\n\nNotes:\n*The number of irreflexive relations is the same as that of reflexive relations.\n*The number of [[Partially ordered set#Strict and non-strict partial orders|strict partial orders]] (irreflexive transitive relations) is the same as that of partial orders.\n*The number of strict weak orders is the same as that of total preorders.\n*The total orders are the partial orders that are also total preorders. The number of preorders that are neither a partial order nor a total preorder is, therefore, the number of preorders, minus the number of partial orders, minus the number of total preorders, plus the number of total orders: 0, 0, 0, 3, and 85, respectively.\n*the number of equivalence relations is the number of [[Partition of a set|partition]]s, which is the [[Bell number]].\n\nThe binary relations can be grouped into pairs (relation, [[Binary relation#Complement|complement]]), except that for ''n'' = 0 the relation is its own complement. The non-symmetric ones can be grouped into [[4-tuple|quadruple]]s (relation, complement, [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|inverse]], inverse complement).\n\n==Examples of common binary relations==\n*[[order relation]]s, including [[strict order]]s:\n** [[greater than]]\n** greater than or equal to\n** [[less than]]\n** less than or equal to\n** [[divides]] (evenly)\n** is a [[subset]] of\n*[[equivalence relation]]s:\n** [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]\n** is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to (for [[affine space]]s)\n** is in [[bijection]] with\n** [[isomorphism|isomorphy]]\n*[[tolerance relation]], a reflexive and symmetric relation\n**[[dependency relation]], a finite tolerance relation\n**[[independency relation]], the complement of some dependency relation\n*[[kinship#Composition of relations|kinship relations]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Abstract rewriting system]]\n* [[Confluence (term rewriting)]]<!--discusses several unusual but fundamental properties of binary relations-->\n* [[Hasse diagram]]\n* [[Incidence structure]]\n* [[Logic of relatives]]\n* [[Order theory]]\n* [[Triadic relation]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* M.

It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports using [[refreshable braille display]]s. They can write braille with the original [[slate and stylus]] or type it on a [[braille writer]], such as a portable [[braille notetaker]] or computer that prints with a [[braille embosser]].\n\nBraille is named after its creator, [[Louis Braille]], a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at the age of fifteen, he developed a code for the [[French alphabet]] as an improvement on [[night writing]]. He published his system, which subsequently included [[musical notation]], in 1829.<ref>[[Louis Braille|Braille, Louis]] (1829). ''Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them''.</ref> The second revision, published in 1837, was the first [[Binary numeral system|small binary]] form of writing developed in the modern era.\n\nThese characters have rectangular blocks called ''cells''  that have tiny bumps called ''raised dots''. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language, and even within one; in [[English Braille]] there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1 \u2013 a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 \u2013 an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 \u2013 various non-standardized personal stenography.\n\nBraille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text. There may be embossed illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, bullets that are larger than braille dots, etc. A full braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns, each column having three dots.<ref name=\"Raised Dots\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afb.org/info/living-with-vision-loss/braille/what-is-braille/123 |title=The Dot Positions Are Identified by Numbers from One Through Six |website=AFB.org |access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref> The dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six.<ref name=\"Raised Dots\"/> There are 64 possible solutions using zero or more dots.<ref name=\"Braille System\">{{cite web |url=https://www.duxburysystems.com/braille.asp |title=Louis Braille and the Braille System |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref> A cell can be used to represent a letter, number, punctuation mark, or even a word.<ref name=\"Raised Dots\"/>\n\nIn the face of [[screen reader]] software, braille usage has declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiazowski|first=Jaroslaw|date=2014|title=Can Braille Be Revived?

It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in [[Paris]], where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two major defects of the code: first, by representing only sounds, the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet.<ref name=\" No\u00eblle Roy \">{{Citation\n | url = http://www.avh.asso.fr/download.php?chemin=rubriques/association/dwnld/&filename=Bio_Br_Paris_GB_060109.pdf\n | title = Louis Braille 1809\u20131852, a French genius\n | last = Roy |first = No\u00eblle\n | website = Valentin Ha\u00fcy Association\n | accessdate = 2011-02-05\n | deadurl = yes\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010054505/http://www.avh.asso.fr/download.php?chemin=rubriques%2Fassociation%2Fdwnld%2F&filename=Bio_Br_Paris_GB_060109.pdf\n | archivedate = 10 October 2010\n | df = dmy-all\n }}</ref>\nAt first, Braille was a one-to-one transliteration of French orthography, but soon various abbreviations, contractions, and even [[logogram]]s were developed, creating a system much more like shorthand.<ref name=digital/> The expanded English system, called [[Grade-2 Braille]], was complete by 1905. For blind readers, Braille is an independent writing system, rather than a code of printed orthography.<ref name=\"D&B\"/>\n\n===Derivation===\nBraille is derived from the Latin alphabet, albeit indirectly. In Braille's original system, the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the [[collating sequence|alphabetic order]] of the French alphabet, with [[diacritic|accented]] letters and ''w'' sorted at the end.<ref>Madeleine Loomis (1942). ''The Braille Reference Book [for Grades I, I\u00bd, and II].''</ref>\n\nThe first ten letters of the alphabet, ''a\u2013j,'' use the upper four dot positions: {{Braille cell|type=text|\u2801|\u2803|\u2809|\u2819|\u2811|\u280b|\u281b|\u2813|\u280a|\u281a}} (black dots in the table below). These stand for the ten digits ''1\u20139'' and ''0'' in a system parallel to Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]]. (Though the dots are assigned in no obvious order, the cells with the fewest dots are assigned to the first three letters (and lowest digits), ''abc = 123'' ({{Braille cell|type=text|\u2801|\u2803|\u2809}}), and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet, ''aei'' ({{Braille cell|type=text|\u2801|\u2811|\u280a}}), whereas the even digits, ''4, 6, 8, 0'' ({{Braille cell|type=text|\u2819|\u280b|\u2813|\u281a}}), are corners/right angles.)\n\nThe next ten letters, ''k\u2013t,'' are identical to ''a\u2013j,'' respectively, apart from the addition of a dot at position 3 (red dots in the table): {{Braille cell|type=text|\u2805|\u2807|\u280d|\u281d|\u2815|\u280f|\u281f|\u2817|\u280e|\u281e}}:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Derivation (colored dots) of the 26 letters of the alphabet from the 10 numeric digits (black dots)\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Braille A1.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille B2.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille C3.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille D4.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille E5.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille F6.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille G7.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille H8.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille I9.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille J0.svg|40px]]\n|- align=center\n|[[a]]/[[1 (number)|1]]||[[b]]/[[2 (number)|2]]||[[c]]/[[3 (number)|3]]||[[d]]/[[4 (number)|4]]||[[e]]/[[5 (number)|5]]||[[f]]/[[6 (number)|6]]||[[g]]/[[7 (number)|7]]||[[h]]/[[8 (number)|8]]||[[i]]/[[9 (number)|9]]||[[j]]/[[0 (number)|0]]\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Braille K colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille L colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille M colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille N colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille O colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille P colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille Q colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille R colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille S colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille T colored.svg|40px]]\n|- align=center\n|[[k]]||[[l]]||[[m]]||[[n]]||[[o]]||[[p]]||[[q]]||[[r]]||[[s]]||[[t]]\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Braille U colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille V colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille X colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille Y colored.svg|40px]]||[[File:Braille Z colored.svg|40px]]|| colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" | ||[[File:Braille W colored.svg|40px]]\n|- align=center\n|[[u]]||[[v]]||[[x]]||[[y]]||[[z]]||[[w]]\n|}\n\nThe next ten letters (the next \"[[wikt:decade#English|decade]]\") are the same again, but with dots also at positions both 3 and 6 (green dots).

The fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots, but proved to be impractical and were soon abandoned. These could be replaced with what we now know as the number sign ({{Braille cell|type=text|\u283c}}), though that only caught on for the digits (old 5th decade \u2192 modern 1st decade). The dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped, producing the modern fifth decade. (See [[1829 braille]].)\n\n===Assignment===\nHistorically, there have been three principles in assigning the values of a [[Linear writing|linear script]] (print) to Braille:  Using Louis Braille's original French letter values; reassigning the braille letters according to the [[sort order]] of the print alphabet being transcribed; and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille.\n\nUnder international consensus, most braille alphabets follow the French sorting order for the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]], and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these 26 (see [[international braille]]), though differences remain, for example in [[German Braille]] and the contractions of [[English Braille]]. This unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet, as happened in [[Algerian Braille]], where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the Arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries (compare modern [[Arabic Braille]], which uses the French sorting order), and as happened in an early American version of English Braille, where the letters ''w, x, y, z'' were reassigned to match English alphabetical order.  A convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic 26 is to exploit the physical symmetry of braille patterns iconically, for example, by assigning a reversed ''n'' to ''\u00f1'' or an inverted ''s'' to ''sh''. (See [[Hungarian Braille]] and [[Bharati Braille]], which do this to some extent.)\n\nA third principle was to assign braille codes according to frequency, with the simplest patterns (quickest ones to write with a stylus) assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet. Such frequency-based alphabets were used in Germany and the United States in the 19th century (see [[American Braille]]), but with the invention of the braille typewriter their advantage disappeared, and none are attested in modern use \u2013 they had the disadvantage that the resulting small number of dots in a text interfered with following the alignment of the letters, and consequently made texts more difficult to read than Braille's more arbitrary letter-assignment. Finally, there are braille scripts which don't order the codes numerically at all, such as [[Japanese Braille]] and [[Korean Braille]], which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition.\n\nAcademic texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six, enabling them to encode a greater number of symbols. (See [[Gardner\u2013Salinas braille codes]].) [[Luxembourgish Braille]] has adopted eight-dot cells for general use; for example, it adds a dot below each letter to derive its capital variant.\n\n==Form==\n[[File:Alianca braille.JPG|thumb|Silver wedding bands with names ''Henri(que)'' and ''Tita'' written in braille]]\nBraille was the first writing system with [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Character encoding|encoding]].<ref name=digital>Daniels, Peter (1996). \"Analog and Digital Writing\", in ''The World's Writing Systems,'' p.&nbsp;886</ref> The system as devised by Braille consists of two parts:<ref name=\"D&B\">Daniels & Bright, 1996, ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp.&nbsp;817\u2013818</ref>\n#[[Character encoding]] that mapped characters of the [[French alphabet]] to [[tuple]]s of six [[bit]]s (the dots),\n#The physical representation of those six-bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell.\n\nWithin an individual cell, the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions. A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions, producing sixty-four (2<sup>6</sup>) possible patterns, including one in which there are no raised dots. For reference purposes, a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised, the positions being universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left and 4 to 6 on the right. For example, dot pattern 1-3-4 describe a cell with three dots raised, at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column:  that is, the letter {{Braille cell|type=text|\u280d}} ''m''. The lines of horizontal Braille text are separated by a space, much like visible printed text, so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below. Different assignments of braille codes (or [[code page]]s) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six-bit cells. Braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation. However, because the six-dot braille cell allows only 64 (2<sup>6</sup>) patterns, including space, the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values, depending on their context. That is, character mapping between print and braille is not one-to-one.  For example, the character {{bc|d}} corresponds in print to both the letter ''d'' and the digit ''4''.\n\nIn addition to simple encoding, many braille alphabets use contractions to reduce the size of braille texts and to increase reading speed. (See [[English Braille#Contractions|Contracted braille]])\n\n==Writing braille==\n[[File:Braille Writer.jpg|thumb|Braille typewriter]]\nBraille may be produced by hand using a [[slate and stylus]] in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, or it may be produced on a [[braille typewriter]] or [[Perkins Brailler]], or an electronic Brailler or eBrailler. Because braille letters cannot be effectively erased and written over if an error is made, an error is overwritten with all six dots ({{bc|\u283f}}). ''Interpoint'' refers to braille printing that is offset, so that the paper can be embossed on both sides, with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other (see the photo in the box at the top of this article for an example).\nUsing a computer or other electronic device, Braille may be produced with a [[braille embosser]] (printer) or a [[refreshable braille display]] (screen).\n\n{{anchor|Eight-dot braille}}Braille has been extended to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays. In 8-dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell, giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are given the numbers 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). Eight-dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable [[ASCII]] characters can be represented in a single cell. All 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the [[Unicode]] standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as [[Braille ASCII]].\n\n===Letters===\nThe first 25 braille letters, up through the first half of the 3rd decade, transcribe ''a\u2013z'' (skipping ''w''). In English Braille, the rest of that decade is rounded out with the ligatures ''and, for, of, the,'' and ''with''. Omitting dot 3 from these forms the 4th decade, the ligatures ''ch, gh, sh, th, wh, ed, er, ou, ow'' and the letter ''w''.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|ch}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|sh}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|th}}\n|- align=center\n|ch\n|sh\n|th\n|}\n(See [[English Braille]].)\n\n===Formatting===\nVarious formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them. They have no direct equivalent in print. The most important in English Braille are:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|CAP}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|#}}\n|- align=center\n|[[Capital letter|Capital]]<br>follows\n|[[Number]]<br>follows\n|}\nThat is, {{Braille cell|type=text|cap|a}} is read as capital 'A', and {{Braille cell|type=text|num|a}} as the digit '1'.\n\n===Punctuation===\nBasic punctuation marks in English Braille include:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|,}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|;}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|'}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|:}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|-}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|decimal}}\n|- align=center\n|[[Comma]]\n|[[Semicolon]]\n|[[Apostrophe]]\n|[[Colon (punctuation)|Colon]]\n|[[Hyphen]]\n|[[Decimal point]]\n|- align=center\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|dd}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|!}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|hh}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|356}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|gg}}\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|size=40px|st}}\n|- align=center\n|[[Full stop|Full stop <br>(Period)]]\n|[[Exclamation point|Exclamation <br>point]]\n|Open [[quotation mark|quote]], <br>[[question mark]]\n|Close <br>[[quotation mark|quote]]\n|[[Bracket|Bracket <br>(Parentheses)]]\n|[[Slash (punctuation)|Slash<br>(Fraction)]]\n|}\n\n{{Braille cell|type=text|hh}} is both the question mark and the opening quotation mark. Its reading depends on whether it occurs before a word or after.\n\n{{Braille cell|type=text|()}} is used for both opening and closing parentheses. Its placement relative to spaces and other characters determines its interpretation.\n\nPunctuation varies from language to language. For example, [[French Braille]] uses {{Braille cell|26|type=text}} for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses (to {{Braille cell|type=unicode|()}} and {{Braille cell|type=unicode|hh|jj}}); it uses the period ({{Braille cell|type=unicode|dd}}) for the decimal point, as in print, and the decimal point ({{Braille cell|type=unicode|decimal}}) to mark capitalization.\n\n===Contractions===\n{{For|a full list of abbreviations and contractions in English|English Braille#Contractions}}\n\nBraille contractions are words and affixes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells. In English Braille, for example, the word ''afternoon'' is written with just three letters, {{bc|\u2801|\u280b|\u281d}} {{angle bracket|afn}}, much like [[stenoscript]]. There are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively [[logogram]]s.<ref name=\"D&B\"/> The most common of these is dot 5, which combines with the first letter of words. With the letter {{bc|\u280d}} ''m'', the resulting word is {{bc|\u2810|\u280d}} ''mother''. There are also [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (\"contracted\" letters), which are single letters in braille but correspond to more than one letter in print. The letter {{bc|\u282f}} ''and'', for example, is used to write words with the sequence ''a-n-d'' in them, such as {{bc|\u2813|\u282f}} ''hand''.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|{{Braille cell|type=6dot|a|f|n}}||{{Braille cell|type=6dot|5|m}}||{{Braille cell|type=6dot|h|and}}\n|-\n|''afternoon<br>(a-f-n)''||''mother<br>(dot 5\u2013m)''||''hand<br>(h-and)''\n|}\n\n===Page dimensions===\nMost [[braille embosser]]s support between 34 and 40 cells per line, and 25 lines per page.\n\nA manually operated Perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of 42 cells per line (its margins are adjustable), and typical paper allows 25 lines per page.\n\nA large interlining Stainsby has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page.\n\nAn A4-sized Marburg braille frame, which allows interpoint braille (dots on both sides of the page, offset so they do not interfere with each other) has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page.\n\n==Literacy==\n{{Main|Braille literacy}}\n\nChildren who are blind not only have the education disadvantage of not being able to see \u2013 they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools.

The raised Braille reads 'plavix'.]]\n[[File:Braille book.JPG|thumb|right|Braille book and the same book in inkprint]]\n\nAlthough it is possible to transcribe print by simply substituting the equivalent braille character for its printed equivalent, in English such a character-by-character transcription (known as ''uncontracted braille'') is only used by beginners.\n\nBraille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents, and the standard 11\" by 11.5\" (28&nbsp;cm &times; 30&nbsp;cm) page has room for only 25 lines of 43 characters. To reduce space and increase reading speed, most braille alphabets and orthographies use ligatures, abbreviations, and contractions. Virtually all English Braille books are transcribed in this ''contracted braille,'' which adds an additional layer of complexity to English orthography: The Library of Congress's ''Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing''<ref>Risjord, Constance (2009). [https://nfb.org/images/nfb/documents/pdf/nls-5th-ed-electronicversion.pdf Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing], Library of Congress, 5th ed. {{ISBN|0-8444-1227-9}}</ref> runs to over 300 pages and braille transcribers must pass certification tests.\n\nFully contracted braille is known as ''Grade 2 Braille''. There is an intermediate form between Computer Braille\u2014one-for-one identity with print\u2014and Grade 2, which is called Grade 1 Braille. In Grade 1, the capital sign and Number sign are used, and most punctuation marks are shown using their Grade 2 values.\n\nThe system of [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]] in English Braille begins with a set of 23 words which are contracted to single characters. Thus the word ''but'' is contracted to the single letter ''b,'' ''can'' to ''c'', ''do'' to ''d'', and so on. Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases; for example, ''d'' is, specifically, an abbreviation of the verb ''do;'' the noun ''do'' representing the note of the musical scale is a different word, and must be spelled out.\n\nPortions of words may be contracted, and many rules govern this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter \"f\" lowered in the Braille cell) stands for \"ff\" when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word \"to\"; the character is written in braille with no space following it. (This contraction was removed in the [[Unified English Braille Code]].) At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.\n\nSome contractions are more similar than their print equivalents. For example, the contraction {{angle bracket|lr}}, meaning 'letter', differs from {{angle bracket|ll}}, meaning 'little', only in adding one dot to the second {{angle bracket|l}}: {{bc|\u2807|\u2807}} ''little'', {{bc|\u2807|\u2817}} ''letter''. This causes greater confusion between the braille spellings of these words and can hinder the learning process of contracted braille.<ref>Hampshire, Barry. ''Working with Braille.'' Paris: Unesco, 1981.</ref>\n\nThe contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word; thus, contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added. Some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber. Thus, when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way, preference is given to \"the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation.\"\n\n''Grade 3 Braille''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050329073830/http://www.geocities.com/jyyne_2000/grade3.htm Grade 3 Braille]. geocities.com (June 2000). Retrieved on 2012-12-21.</ref> is a variety of non-standardized systems that include many additional shorthand-like contractions. They are not used for publication, but by individuals for their personal convenience.\n\n==Braille translation software==\nWhen people produce braille, this is called braille transcription. When computer software produces braille, this is called braille\ntranslation. Braille translation software exists to handle most of the common languages of the world, and many technical areas,\nsuch as [[mathematics]] ([[mathematical notation]]), for example [[WIMATS]], [[music]] ([[musical notation]]), and tactile graphics.\n\n==Braille-reading techniques==\nSince Braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills.  One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's fingers along the words. There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland<ref>Holland, B. F. (1934). \"Speed and Pressure Factors in Braille Reading\", ''Teachers Forum,'' Vol. 7. pp.&nbsp;13\u201317</ref> suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.\n\nAnother study by Lowenfield & Abel<ref>Lowenfield, B.; Abel, and G. L. (1977). ''Methods of Teaching Braille Reading Efficiency of Children in Lower Senior Classes.'' Birmingham, Research Centre for the Education of the Visually Handicapped</ref> shows that braille could be read \"the fastest and best... by students who read using the index fingers of both hands\". Another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously. One final conclusion drawn by both Lowenfield and Abel is that children have difficulty using both hands independently where the right hand is the dominant hand.  But this hand preference does not correlate to other activities.\n\n==International uniformity==\n{{Main|International uniformity of braille}}\n{{anchor|Grade 1 braille}}\n[[File:Rapperswil - Duftrosengarten 20080222 005.jpg|thumb|Braille plate at ''[[Duftrosengarten]]'' in [[Rapperswil]], Switzerland]]\n\nWhen Braille was first adapted to languages other than French, many schemes were adopted, including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of French \u2013 e.g. in English W, which was not in the French alphabet at the time, is mapped to braille X, X to Y, Y to Z, and Z to the first French-accented letter \u2013 or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns. Consequently, mutual intelligibility was greatly hindered by this state of affairs. In 1878, the International Congress on Work for the Blind, held in Paris, proposed an international braille standard, where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based, not on the order of a particular alphabet, but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to Latin.<ref name=IntlBraille>{{cite web|title=International Meeting on Braille Uniformity|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000711/071103eb.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2012-04-24}}</ref>\n\nThis unified braille has been applied to the languages of India and Africa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Russian, and Armenian, as well as nearly all Latin-script languages. Greek, for example, ''gamma'' is written as Latin ''g'', despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of ''c''; Hebrew ''bet'', the second letter of the alphabet and [[cognate]] with the Latin letter ''b'', is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is written ''b'' or ''v'' accordingly; Russian ''ts'' is written as ''c'', which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic ''f'' is written as ''f'', despite being historically ''p'', and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic ''o'' and ''q'').\n\n==Other braille conventions==\n\nOther systems for assigning values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original French order. Some braille alphabets start with [[unified braille]], and then diverge significantly based on the phonology of the target languages, while others diverge even further.\n\nIn the various Chinese systems, traditional braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels. In both [[Mainland Chinese Braille|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese Braille]], however, characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable-initial (onset) or syllable-final (rime) position. For instance, the cell for Latin ''k'', {{Braille cell|type=text|K}}, represents Cantonese ''k'' (''g'' in [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]] and other modern romanizations) when initial, but ''aak'' when final, while Latin ''j'', {{Braille cell|type=text|J}}, represents Cantonese initial ''j'' but final ''oei''.\n\nNovel systems of braille mapping include Korean, which adopts separate syllable-initial and syllable-final forms for its consonants, explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic groups in the same way as [[hangul]]. Japanese, meanwhile, combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell \u2013 an [[abugida]] representation of each Japanese [[Mora (linguistics)#Japanese|mora]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Braille wine label.jpg|thumb|A bottle of [[Chapoutier]] wine, with braille on the label]]\n[[File:Bahnhofsplan f\u00fcr Blinde, Hannover Hbf, Ausschnitt Eingangsbereich.jpg|thumb|An embossed map of a German train station, with braille text]]\nThe current series of [[Banknotes of the Canadian dollar|Canadian banknotes]] has a [[Canadian currency tactile feature|tactile feature]] consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination, allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people.

Some embossers have proprietary control codes for 8-dot braille or for full graphics mode, where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between braille cells so that continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams, but these are rarely used and are not standard.\n\nThe Unicode standard encodes 8-dot braille glyphs according to their binary appearance, rather than following their assigned numeric order. Dot 1 corresponds to the [[least significant bit]] of the low byte of the Unicode scalar value, and dot 8 to the high bit of that byte.\n\nThe Unicode block for braille is U+2800 ...

But as their numbers increased their indignation arose: they retired a few steps, posted themselves on and behind large piles of loose stone collected in that Place for a bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with stones. The horse charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and the showers of stones obliged them to retire, and even to quit the field altogether, leaving one of their number on the ground. The Swiss in their rear were observed never to stir. This was the signal for universal insurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred, retired towards Versailles. <br> The people now armed themselves with such weapons as they could find in Armourer's shops and private houses, and with bludgeons, and were roaming all night through all parts of the city without any decided and practicable object. <br> July 13 <br> [...]A Committee of magistrates and electors of the city are appointed, by their bodies, to take upon them its government. <br> The mob, now openly joined by the French guards, force the prisons of St. Lazare, release all the prisoners, and take a great store of corn, which they carry to the corn market.

The people of Paris then stormed the [[Bastille]], fearful that they and their representatives would be attacked by the royal army or by foreign regiments of mercenaries in the king's service, and seeking to gain ammunition and gunpowder for the general populace. The Bastille was a fortress-prison in Paris which had often held people jailed on the basis of ''[[lettre de cachet|lettres de cachet]]'' (literally \"signet letters\"), arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed and did not indicate the reason for the imprisonment. The Bastille held a large cache of ammunition and gunpowder, and was also known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government, and was thus a symbol of the [[political absolutism|absolutism]] of the monarchy. As it happened, at the time of the attack in July 1789 there were only seven inmates, none of great political significance.<ref>G A Chevallaz, Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 1789 \u00e0 nos jours, p. 22, Payot, Lausanne 1974</ref>\n\nThe crowd was eventually reinforced by mutinous ''[[Gardes Fran\u00e7aises]]'' (\"French Guards\"), whose usual role was to protect public buildings. They proved a fair match for the fort's defenders, and [[Bernard-Ren\u00e9 de Launay|Governor de Launay]], the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. According to the official documents, about 200 attackers and just one defender died in the initial fighting, but in the aftermath, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was [[Jacques de Flesselles]], the ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t des marchands'' (\"provost of the merchants\"), the elected head of the city's guilds, who under the feudal monarchy also had the competences of a present-day mayor.<ref>J Isaac, L'\u00e9poque r\u00e9volutionnaire 1789\u20131851, p. 60, Hachette, Paris 1950</ref>\n\nShortly after the storming of the Bastille, late in the evening of 4 August, after a very stormy session of the ''Assembl\u00e9e constituante'', [[feudalism]] was abolished.

Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective [[cryptanalysis]] of it has been found to date. However, the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) now receives more attention, and Schneier recommends [[Twofish]] for modern applications.<ref name=\"schneier-interview-dec-2007\" />\n\nSchneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by [[patent]]s or were commercial or government secrets. Schneier has stated that, \"Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the [[public domain]], and can be freely used by anyone.\"<ref name=\"blowfish-paper\"/>\n\nNotable features of the design include key-dependent [[S-box]]es and a highly complex [[key schedule]].\n\n==The algorithm==\nBlowfish has a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a variable [[key length]] from 32 bits up to 448 bits.<ref name=\"blowfish-paper\">{{cite journal\n |url         = https://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html\n |title       = Description of a New Variable-Length Key, 64-Bit Block Cipher (Blowfish)\n |author      = Bruce Schneier\n |author-link = Bruce Schneier\n |work        = [[Fast Software Encryption]], Cambridge Security Workshop Proceedings\n |publisher   = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n |pages       = 191\u2013204\n |year        = 1993\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140126182135/https://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html\n |archivedate = 2014-01-26\n |df          = \n}}</ref> It is a 16-round [[Feistel cipher]] and uses large key-dependent [[Substitution box|S-boxes]]. In structure it resembles [[CAST-128]], which uses fixed S-boxes.\n[[File:Blowfish diagram.png|left|thumb|181x181px|The Feistel structure of Blowfish]]\nThe adjacent diagram shows Blowfish's encryption routine. Each line represents 32 bits. There are five subkey-arrays: one 18-entry P-array (denoted as K in the diagram, to avoid confusion with the Plaintext) and four 256-entry S-boxes (S0, S1, S2 and S3).\n\nEvery round ''r'' consists of 4 actions: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Action 1'''\n|XOR the left half (L) of the data with the ''r'' th P-array entry\n|-\n|'''Action 2'''\n|Use the XORed data as input for Blowfish's F-function\n|-\n|'''Action 3'''\n|XOR the F-function's output with the right half (R) of the data\n|-\n|'''Action 4'''\n|Swap L and R\n|}\n\nThe F-function splits the 32-bit input into four eight-bit quarters, and uses the quarters as input to the S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. The outputs are added [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2<sup>32</sup> and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output (see image in the upper right corner).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cryptography: Description of a New Variable-Length Key, 64-Bit Block Cipher (Blowfish) - Schneier on Security|url = https://www.schneier.com/cryptography/archives/1994/09/description_of_a_new.html|website = www.schneier.com|accessdate = 2015-12-31|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200440/https://www.schneier.com/cryptography/archives/1994/09/description_of_a_new.html|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 16th round, undo the last swap, and XOR L with K18 and R with K17 (output whitening).\n\nDecryption is exactly the same as encryption, except that P1, P2, \u2026, P18 are used in the reverse order. This is not so obvious because xor is commutative and associative. A common misconception is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).\n\nBlowfish's [[key schedule]] starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from the [[hexadecimal]] digits of [[pi]], which contain no obvious pattern (see [[nothing up my sleeve number]]). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.\n\nBecause the P-array is 576 bits long, and the key bytes are XORed through all these 576 bits during the initialization, many implementations support key sizes up to 576 bits. The reason for that is a discrepancy between the original Blowfish description, which uses 448-bit key, and its reference implementation, which uses 576-bit key. The test vectors for verifying third party implementations were also produced with 576-bit keys. When asked which Blowfish version is the correct one, Bruce Schneier answered: \"''The test vectors should be used to determine the one true Blowfish''\".\n\nAnother opinion is that the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key,<ref name=\"blowfish-paper\"/> as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.\n\n==Blowfish in pseudocode==\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nuint32_t P[18];\nuint32_t S[4][256];\n\nuint32_t f (uint32_t x) {\n   uint32_t h = S[0][x >> 24] + S[1][x >> 16 & 0xff];\n   return ( h ^ S[2][x >> 8 & 0xff] ) + S[3][x & 0xff];\n}\n\nvoid encrypt (uint32_t & L, uint32_t & R) {\n   for (int i=0 ; i<16 ; i += 2) {\n      L ^= P[i];\n      R ^= f(L);\n      R ^= P[i+1];\n      L ^= f(R);\n   }\n   L ^= P[16];\n   R ^= P[17];\n   swap (L, R);\n}\n\nvoid decrypt (uint32_t & L, uint32_t & R) {\n   for (int i=16 ; i > 0 ; i -= 2) {\n      L ^= P[i+1];\n      R ^= f(L);\n      R ^= P[i];\n      L ^= f(R);\n   }\n   L ^= P[1];\n   R ^= P[0];\n   swap (L, R);\n}\n\n{\n   // ...\n   // initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from pi; omitted in the example\n   // ...\n   for (int i=0 ; i<18 ; ++i)\n      P[i] ^= key[i % keylen];\n   uint32_t L = 0, R = 0;\n   for (int i=0 ; i<18 ; i+=2) {\n      encrypt (L, R);\n      P[i] = L; P[i+1] = R;\n   }\n   for (int i=0 ; i<4 ; ++i)\n      for (int j=0 ; j<256; j+=2) {\n         encrypt (L, R);\n         S[i][j] = L; S[i][j+1] = R;\n      }\n}\n</source>\n\n==Blowfish in practice==\nBlowfish is a fast [[block cipher]], except when changing keys. Each new [[key (cryptography)|key]] requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but is not a problem in others.\n\nIn one application Blowfish's slow key changing is actually a benefit: the [[password]]-hashing method used in [[OpenBSD]] uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against [[dictionary attack]]s. ''See'' [[key stretching]].\n\nBlowfish has a memory footprint of just over 4 kilobytes of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. This constraint is not a problem even for older desktop and [[laptop computers]], though it does prevent use in the smallest [[embedded systems]] such as early [[smartcard]]s.\n\nBlowfish was one of the first secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and therefore freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in cryptographic software.\n\n[[bcrypt]] is a [[Cryptographic hash function#Password verification|password hashing function]] which, combined with a variable number of iterations (work \"cost\"), exploits the expensive key setup phase of Blowfish to increase the workload and duration of hash calculations, further reducing threats from brute force attacks.\n\nbcrypt is also the name of a cross-platform file encryption utility implementing Blowfish developed in 2002.<ref>[http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net \"Bcrypt - Blowfish File Encryption\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829060804/http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/ |date=2015-08-29}} bcrypt file encryption program homepage (bcrypt.sourceforge.net)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcrypt463065.android.informer.com/|title=bcrypt Free Download - whodunnit.tools.bcrypt|author=|date=|website=bcrypt463065.android.informer.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075720/http://bcrypt463065.android.informer.com/ |archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t2-project.org/packages/bcrypt.html|title=T2 package - trunk - bcrypt - A utility to encrypt files.|author=|date=|website=www.t2-project.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421043425/http://t2-project.org/packages/bcrypt.html|archivedate=21 April 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51849_01/gg-winux/OGGLC/ogglc_licenses.htm|title=Oracle GoldenGate\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9|author=|date=|website=docs.oracle.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027233204/https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51849_01/gg-winux/OGGLC/ogglc_licenses.htm|archivedate=27 October 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Weakness and successors==\nBlowfish's use of a 64-bit block size (as opposed to e.g. AES's 128-bit block size) makes it vulnerable to [[birthday attack]]s, particularly in contexts like [[HTTPS]].

For example, ''f''(1) = D.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''bijection''', '''bijective function''', or '''one-to-one correspondence''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] between the elements of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]], where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a [[Injective function|one-to-one (injective)]] and [[Surjective function|onto (surjective)]] mapping of a set ''X'' to a set ''Y''.\n\nA bijection from the set ''X'' to the set ''Y'' has an [[inverse function]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.  If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For [[infinite set]]s the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.\n\nA bijective function from a set to itself is also called a ''[[permutation]]''.\n\nBijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of [[isomorphism]], [[homeomorphism]], [[diffeomorphism]], [[permutation group]], and [[projective map]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}\nFor a pairing between ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''Y'' need not be different from ''X'') to be a bijection, four properties must hold:\n# each element of ''X'' must be paired with at least one element of ''Y'',\n# no element of ''X'' may be paired with more than one element of ''Y'',\n# each element of ''Y'' must be paired with at least one element of ''X'', and\n# no element of ''Y'' may be paired with more than one element of ''X''.\n\nSatisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] with [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X''. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of ''X'' is paired with exactly one element of ''Y''. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be \"[[onto]] ''Y'' \" and are called [[Surjective function|surjections]] (or '''surjective functions'''). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be \"[[one-to-one function]]s\" and are called [[Injective function|injections]] (or '''injective functions''').<ref>There are names associated to properties (1) and (2) as well. A relation which satisfies property (1) is called a ''total relation'' and a relation satisfying (2) is a ''single valued relation''.</ref> With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both \"one-to-one\" and \"onto\".\n\nBijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail ({{unichar|2916|RIGHTWARDS TWO-HEADED ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}), as in ''f'' : ''X'' \u2916 ''Y''. This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote injections.\n\n==Examples==\n\n=== Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team===\nConsider the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting line-up]] of a [[baseball]] or [[cricket]] team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set ''X'' will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set ''Y'' will be the  positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The \"pairing\" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.\n\n=== Seats and students of a classroom===\nIn a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:\n# Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),\n# No student was in more than one seat,\n# Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and\n# No seat had more than one student in it. \nThe instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.\n\n==More mathematical examples and some non-examples==\n* For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] '''1'''<sub>''X''</sub>: ''X'' \u2192 ''X'', '''1'''<sub>''X''</sub>(''x'') = ''x'', is bijective.\n* The function ''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is bijective, since for each ''y'' there is a unique ''x'' = (''y'' \u2212 1)/2 such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. In more generality, any [[linear function]] over the reals,  ''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'' (where ''a'' is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number ''y'' is obtained from (paired with) the real number ''x'' = (''y'' - ''b'')/''a''.\n* The function ''f'': ''R'' \u2192 (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), given by ''f''(''x'') = arctan(''x'') is bijective since each real number ''x'' is paired with exactly one angle ''y'' in the interval (-\u03c0/2,&nbsp;\u03c0/2) so that tan(''y'') = ''x'' (that is, ''y'' = arctan(''x'')). If the [[codomain]]  (-\u03c0/2,&nbsp;\u03c0/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of \u03c0/2 then this function would no longer be onto (surjective) since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of \u03c0/2 by this arctan function. \n* The [[exponential function]], ''g'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''', ''g''(''x'') = e<sup>''x''</sup>, is not bijective: for instance, there is no ''x'' in '''R''' such that ''g''(''x'') = \u22121, showing that ''g'' is not onto (surjective).  However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers <math>\\scriptstyle \\R^+ \\;\\equiv\\; \\left(0,\\, +\\infty\\right)</math>, then ''g'' becomes bijective; its inverse (see below) is the [[natural logarithm]] function ln.\n* The function ''h'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>+</sup>, ''h''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> is not bijective: for instance, ''h''(\u22121) = ''h''(1) = 1, showing that ''h''  is not one-to-one (injective).  However, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to <math>\\scriptstyle\\R^+_0 \\;\\equiv\\; \\left[0,\\, +\\infty\\right)</math>, then ''h'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.\n\n==Inverses==\nA bijection ''f'' with domain ''X'' (indicated by ''f'': ''X \u2192 Y'' in [[Function (mathematics)#Notation|functional notation]]) also defines a [[converse relation]] starting in ''Y'' and going to ''X'' (by turning the arrows around). The process of \"turning the arrows around\" for an arbitrary function does not, ''in general'', yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain ''Y''. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse ''function'' is a surjection and an injection, that is, the [[inverse function]] exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be [[Invertible function|invertible]]. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.\n\nStated in concise mathematical notation, a function ''f'': ''X \u2192 Y'' is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition\n:for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there is a unique ''x'' in ''X'' with ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').\n\nContinuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.\n\n==Composition==\nThe [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] <math>\\scriptstyle g \\,\\circ\\, f</math> of two bijections ''f'': ''X \u2192 Y'' and ''g'': ''Y \u2192 Z'' is a bijection. The inverse of <math>\\scriptstyle g \\,\\circ\\, f</math> is <math>\\scriptstyle (g \\,\\circ\\, f)^{-1} \\;=\\; (f^{-1}) \\,\\circ\\, (g^{-1})</math>.\n\n[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).]]\nConversely, if the composition <math>\\scriptstyle g \\,\\circ\\, f</math> of two functions is bijective, we can only say that ''f'' is [[Injective function|injective]] and ''g'' is [[surjective function|surjective]].\n\n==Bijections and cardinality==\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' [[iff|if and only if]] ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [[axiomatic set theory]], this is taken as the definition of \"same number of elements\" ([[equinumerosity]]), and generalising this definition to [[infinite set]]s leads to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.\n\n== Properties ==\n* A function ''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R''' is bijective if and only if its [[graph of a function|graph]] meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.\n* If ''X'' is a set, then the bijective functions from ''X'' to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (\u2218), form a [[group (algebra)|group]], the [[symmetric group]] of ''X'', which is denoted variously by S(''X''), ''S<sub>X</sub>'', or ''X''! (''X'' [[factorial]]).\n* Bijections preserve [[cardinalities]] of sets: for a subset ''A'' of the domain with cardinality |''A''| and subset ''B'' of the codomain with cardinality |''B''|, one has the following equalities:\n*:|''f''(''A'')| = |''A''| and |''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''B'')| = |''B''|.\n*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s with the same cardinality, and ''f'': ''X \u2192 Y'', then the following are equivalent:\n*# ''f'' is a bijection.\n*# ''f'' is a [[surjection]].\n*# ''f'' is an [[injection (mathematics)|injection]].\n*For a finite set ''S'', there is a bijection between the set of possible [[total ordering]]s of the elements and the set of bijections from ''S'' to ''S''.  That is to say, the number of [[permutation]]s of elements of ''S'' is the same as the number of total orderings of that set\u2014namely, ''n''!.\n\n==Bijections and category theory==\nBijections are precisely the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and set functions.  However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories.  For example, in the category '''[[Category of groups|Grp]]''' of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], the morphisms must be [[homomorphism]]s since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are ''group isomorphisms'' which are bijective homomorphisms.\n\n==Generalization to partial functions==\nThe notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to [[partial functions]], where they are called '''partial bijections''', although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a [[total function]], i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]].<ref name=\"Hollings2014\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA251|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from ''A'' to ''B'' is any relation \n''R'' (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that ''R'' is the [[Graph of a function|graph of]] a bijection ''f'':''A\u2032''\u2192''B\u2032'', where ''A\u2032'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' and ''B\u2032'' is a subset of ''B''.<ref name=\"Borceux1994\">{{cite book|author=Francis Borceux|title=Handbook of Categorical Algebra: Volume 2, Categories and Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2v9q0m5XAC&pg=PA289|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44179-7|page=289}}</ref>\n\nWhen the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a '''one-to-one partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]'''.<ref name=\"Grillet1995\">{{cite book|author=Pierre A.

In computer science, this identification between a function from ''X'' \u00d7 ''Y'' to ''Z'' and a function from ''X'' to ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup>, where ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> is the set of all functions from ''Y'' to ''Z'', is called ''[[currying]]''.\n\n==Generalisations==\nThe various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.\nFor example, the division example above is ''[[surjective function|surjective]]'' (or ''onto'') because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.\nThis example is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' in each input separately, because the functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f'' <sub>''y''</sub> are always injective.\nHowever, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) ''f'' (2,4) = ''f'' (1,2).\n\nOne can also consider ''partial'' binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.\nFor example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from '''Z''' and '''N''' to '''Q''', where '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.\nBut this function is undefined when the second input is zero.\n\nA [[binary operation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all equal; binary operations are often used to define [[algebraic structure]]s.\n\nIn [[linear algebra]], a [[bilinear operator|bilinear transformation]] is a binary function where the sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are all [[vector space]]s and the derived functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f''<sub>''y''</sub> are all [[linear transformation]]s.\nA bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from ''X'' \u00d7 ''Y'' to ''Z'', but this function in general won't be linear.\nHowever, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the [[tensor product]] <math>X \\otimes Y</math> to ''Z''.\n\n==Generalisations to ternary and other functions==\n{{see also|Multivariate function}}\nThe concept of binary function generalises to ''ternary'' (or ''3-ary'') ''function'', ''quaternary'' (or ''4-ary'') ''function'', or more generally to ''n-ary function'' for any [[natural number]] ''n''.\nA ''0-ary function'' to ''Z'' is simply given by an element of ''Z''.\nOne can also define an ''A-ary function'' where ''A'' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]]; there is one input for each element of ''A''.\n\n==Category theory==\nIn [[category theory]], ''n''-ary functions generalise to ''n''-ary morphisms in a [[multicategory]].\nThe interpretation of an ''n''-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original ''n''-ary morphism will work in a [[monoidal category]].\nThe construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a [[closed monoidal category]].\nThe category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binary Function}}\n[[Category:Types of functions]]\n[[Category:2 (number)]]", "sha1": "jz3sn0alixj11ugtwgqtc2sntbi4zr1"}}, {"title": "Blue Velvet (film)", "ns": "0", "id": "3947", "revision": {"id": "864393073", "parentid": "864141868", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T22:24:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "DudemanOfBorg", "id": "31581524"}, "minor": "", "comment": "punctuation", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Good article}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Blue Velvet\n| image          = Blue Velvet (1986).png\n| alt = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[David Lynch]]\n| producer       = [[Fred C.

While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams ([[George Dickerson]]) and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]). She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]), who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.\n\nJeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings \"[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]],\" and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knife-point and begins to [[Fellatio|fellate]] him before their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth ([[Dennis Hopper]]), inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities\u2014which include inhaling an unidentified gas, [[Non-penetrative sex|dry humping]], and [[sadomasochism]]\u2014upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent man whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as \"Mommy\" and to himself as both the \"Daddy\" and the \"Baby,\" who \"wants to fuck.\" Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to \"Do it for van Gogh.\" When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.\n\nJeffrey relays his experience to Sandy, asking her why there are people like Frank. Sandy in turn tells him of a wonderful dream she had about robins that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. Jeffrey and Sandy find themselves attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.\n\nJeffrey again visits Dorothy's apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.\n\nAfterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben ([[Dean Stockwell]]), his suave, effeminate partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben [[lip-syncs]] a performance of [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]],\" sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Frank's cronies ([[Brad Dourif]], [[Jack Nance]] and J. Michael Hunter) drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of \"In Dreams.\" Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair.\n\nHe goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man\u2014an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon. Later Jeffrey goes to Sandy's home and tells Sandy's father about Frank. He is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love; on the way home they are chased by a car. Jeffrey thinks it is Frank, but it turns out to be Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy \u2014 naked, battered, and distressed \u2014 on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.\n\nJeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot to the head and identifiable by his missing ear, as well as the Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment, remembering from their \"joyride\" that Frank has a police radio. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of a robin in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Dorothy Vallens\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Jeffrey Beaumont\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]]\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Sandy Williams\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Mrs. Pam Williams\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Ben\n* [[George Dickerson]] as Detective John Williams\n* [[Priscilla Pointer]] as Mrs. Frances Beaumont\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Aunt Barbara\n* Jack Harvey as Mr. Tom Beaumont\n* Ken Stovitz as Mike\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Raymond\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Paul\n* J.

Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. \"I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery.

More formally, a binary operation is an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] of [[arity]] of two whose two [[Domain of a function|domains]] and one [[codomain]] are the same set.  Examples include the familiar [[elementary arithmetic]] operations of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]].  Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as [[vector addition]], [[matrix multiplication]] and [[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugation in groups]].\n\n==Terminology==\nMore precisely, a binary operation on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends elements of the [[Cartesian product]] {{nowrap|''S'' \u00d7 ''S''}} to ''S'':<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|1973|loc=pg. 1}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hardy|Walker|2002|loc=pg. 176, Definition 67}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Fraleigh|1976|loc= pg. 10}}</ref>\n:<math>\\,f \\colon S \\times S \\rightarrow S.</math>\nBecause the result of performing the operation on a pair of elements of ''S'' is again an element of ''S'', the operation is called a '''closed''' binary operation on ''S'' (or sometimes expressed as having the property of [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1959|loc=pg. 1}}</ref>  If ''f'' is not a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], but is instead a [[partial function]], it is called a '''partial binary operation'''.  For instance, division of [[real numbers]] is a partial binary operation, because one can't [[Division by zero|divide by zero]]: ''a''/0 is not defined for any real ''a''.  Note however that both in [[algebra]] and [[model theory]] the binary operations considered are defined on all of {{nowrap|''S'' \u00d7 ''S''}}.\n\nSometimes, especially in [[computer science]], the term is used for any [[binary function]].\n\nBinary operations are the keystone of algebraic structures studied in [[abstract algebra]]: they are essential in the definitions of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[monoid]]s, [[semigroup]]s, [[ring (algebra)|ring]]s, and more.  Most generally, a ''[[magma (algebra)|magma]]'' is a set together with some binary operation defined on it.\n\n== Properties and examples ==\nTypical examples of binary operations are the [[addition]] (+) and [[multiplication]] (&times;) of [[number]]s and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] as well as [[composition of functions]] on a single set.\nFor instance,\n* On the set of real numbers '''R''', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''a'' + ''b''}} is a binary operation since the sum of two real numbers is a real number.\n* On the set of natural numbers '''N''', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''a'' + ''b''}} is a binary operation since the sum of two natural numbers is a natural number.  This is a different binary operation than the previous one since the sets are different.\n* On the set M(2,2) of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices with real entries, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''A'', ''B'') = ''A'' + ''B''}} is a binary operation since the sum of two such matrices is another {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix.\n* On the set M(2,2) of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices with real entries, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''A'', ''B'') = ''AB''}} is a binary operation since the product of two such matrices is another {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix.\n* For a given set ''C'', let ''S'' be the set of all functions {{nowrap|''h'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''C''}}.  Define {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S'' \u00d7 ''S'' \u2192 ''S''}} by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''h''{{sub|1}}, ''h''{{sub|2}})(''c'') = ''h''{{sub|1}} \u2218 ''h''{{sub|2}} (''c'') = ''h''{{sub|1}}(''h''{{sub|2}}(''c''))}} for all {{nowrap|''c'' \u2208 ''C''}}, the composition of the two functions ''h''{{sub|1}} and ''h''{{sub|2}} in ''S''. Then ''f'' is a binary operation since the composition of the two functions is another function on the set ''C'' (that is, a member of ''S'').\n\nMany binary operations of interest in both algebra and formal logic are [[commutative]], satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''f''(''b'', ''a'')}} for all elements ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S'', or [[associative]], satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f''(''f''(''a'', ''b''), ''c'') = ''f''(''a'', ''f''(''b'', ''c''))}} for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S''.  Many also have [[identity element]]s and [[inverse element]]s.\n\nThe first three examples above are commutative and all of the above examples are associative.\n\nOn the set of real numbers '''R''', [[subtraction]], that is, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'', ''b'') = ''a'' \u2212 ''b''}}, is a binary operation which is not commutative since, in general, {{nowrap|''a'' \u2212 ''b'' \u2260 ''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}.  It is also not associative, since, in general, {{nowrap|''a'' \u2212 (''b'' \u2212 ''c'') \u2260 (''a'' \u2212 ''b'') \u2212 ''c''}}; for instance, {{nowrap|1=1 \u2212 (2 \u2212 3) = 2}} but {{nowrap|1=(1 \u2212 2) \u2212 3 = \u22124}}.\n\nOn the set of natural numbers '''N''', the binary operation [[exponentiation]], {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'',''b'') = ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}}, is not commutative since, [[Equation x\u02b8=y\u02e3|in general]], {{nowrap|''a''<sup>''b''</sup> \u2260 ''b''<sup>''a''</sup>}} and is also not associative since {{nowrap|''f''(''f''(''a'', ''b''), ''c'') \u2260 ''f''(''a'', ''f''(''b'', ''c''))}}.  For instance, with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=''c'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''(2<sup>3</sup>,2) = ''f''(8,2) = 8<sup>2</sup> = 64}}, but {{nowrap|1=''f''(2,3<sup>2</sup>) = ''f''(2,9) = 2<sup>9</sup> = 512}}.  By changing the set '''N''' to the set of integers '''Z''', this binary operation becomes a partial binary operation since it is now undefined when {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 0}} and ''b'' is any negative integer.  For either set, this operation has a ''right identity'' (which is 1) since {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'', 1) = ''a''}} for all ''a'' in the set, which is not an ''identity'' (two sided identity) since {{nowrap|''f''(1, ''b'') \u2260 ''b''}} in general.\n\n[[division (mathematics)|Division]] (/), a partial binary operation on the set of real or rational numbers, is not commutative or associative.  [[Tetration]] (\u2191\u2191), as a binary operation on the natural numbers, is not commutative or associative and has no identity element.\n\n==Notation==\nBinary operations are often written using [[infix notation]] such as {{nowrap|''a'' \u2217 ''b''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} or (by [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]] with no symbol) ''ab'' rather than by functional notation of the form {{nowrap|''f''(''a'', ''b'')}}.  Powers are usually also written without operator, but with the second argument as [[superscript]].\n\nBinary operations sometimes use prefix or (probably more often) postfix notation, both of which dispense with parentheses.  They are also called, respectively, [[Polish notation]] and [[reverse Polish notation]].\n\n==Pair and tuple==\nA binary operation, ''ab'', depends on the [[ordered pair]] (''a, b'') and so (''ab'')''c'' (where the parentheses here mean first operate on the ordered pair (''a'', ''b'') and then operate on the result of that using the ordered pair ((''ab''), ''c'')) depends in general on the ordered pair ((''a'', ''b''), ''c'').  Thus, for the general, non-associative case, binary operations can be represented with [[binary tree]]s.\n\nHowever:\n*If the operation is associative, (''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc''), then the value of (''ab'')''c'' depends only on the [[tuple]] (''a'', ''b'', ''c'').\n*If the operation is commutative, ''ab'' = ''ba'', then the value of (''ab'')''c'' depends only on { {''a'', ''b''}, ''c''}, where braces indicate  [[multiset]]s.\n*If the operation is both associative and commutative then the value of (''ab'')''c'' depends only on the multiset {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}.\n*If the operation is associative, commutative and [[idempotent]], ''aa'' = ''a'', then the value of (''ab'')''c''  depends only on the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}.\n\n== Binary operations as ternary relations ==\n\nA binary operation ''f'' on a set ''S'' may be viewed as a ''ternary'' [[Finitary relation|relation]] on ''S'', that is, the set of triples (''a'', ''b'', ''f(a,b)'') in ''S'' \u00d7 ''S'' \u00d7 ''S'' for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''S''.\n\n== External binary operations ==\nAn '''[[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation''' is a binary function from ''K'' &times; ''S'' to ''S''.  This differs from a binary operation in the strict sense in that ''K'' need not be ''S''; its elements come from ''outside''.\n\nAn example of an [[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation is [[scalar multiplication]] in [[linear algebra]].  Here ''K'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and ''S'' is a [[vector space]] over that field.\n\nAn [[external (mathematics)|external]] binary operation may alternatively be viewed as an [[group action|action]]; ''K'' is acting on ''S''.\n\nNote that the [[dot product]] of two vectors is not a binary operation, external or otherwise, as it maps from ''S &times; ''S'' to ''K'', where ''K'' is a field and ''S'' is a vector space over ''K''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Truth table#Binary operations]]\n* [[Iterated binary operation]]\n* [[Operator (programming)]]\n* [[Ternary operation]]\n* [[Unary operation]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References==\n* {{citation|last=Fraleigh|first=John B.|title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra|edition=2nd|publisher=Addison-Wesley|place=Reading|year=1976|isbn=0-201-01984-1}}\n* {{citation|last=Hall, Jr.|first= Marshall|title=The Theory of Groups|publisher=Macmillan|place=New York|year=1959}}\n* {{citation|last1=Hardy|first1=Darel W.|last2=Walker|first2=Carol L.|title=Applied Algebra: Codes, Ciphers and Discrete Algorithms|publisher=Prentice-Hall|place=Upper Saddle River, NJ|year=2002|isbn=0-13-067464-8}}\n* {{citation|last=Rotman|first=Joseph J.|title=The Theory of Groups: An Introduction|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|place=Boston|year=1973|edition=2nd}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathWorld|title=Binary Operation|urlname=BinaryOperation}}\n\n{{Mathematical logic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binary Operation}}\n[[Category:Binary operations| ]]", "sha1": "gcllarujxjfc4ycjrmcexjcgbcxdnmb"}}, {"title": "Bagpipes", "ns": "0", "id": "3950", "revision": {"id": "865268901", "parentid": "865268883", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T20:49:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/ScotlandYaBass|ScotlandYaBass]] to version by JarrahTree.

Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks\u2014sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.\n\n=== Air supply ===\nThe most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.\n\nAn innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called \"[[cauld wind pipes (disambiguation)|cauld wind pipes]]\", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish [[uilleann pipes]]; the Scottish [[border pipes|border or Lowland pipes]]; [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], [[pastoral pipes]] and [[English Border pipes]] in Britain; and the [[musette de cour]], [[cabrette]] and [[Musette bechonnet]] in France, the [[Dudy wielkopolskie]], [[koziol bialy]] and [[koziol czarny]] in Poland.\n\n=== Bag ===\nThe bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of lung infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835 |title=Bagpipe warning over threat of fatal fungus \u2013 Health |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.\n\nBags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.\n\n=== Chanter ===\n{{Main|Chanter}}\nThe chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, the Balkans in Southern Europe, and Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or \"cylindrical\") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.\n\nThe chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or \"ornaments\") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the uilleann pipes, the Northumbrian smallpipe, the piva and the left chanter of the ''surdulina'') have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player \"closes\" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.\n\nA [[practice chanter]] is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.\n\nThe term ''chanter'' is derived from the Latin ''cantare'', or \"to sing\", much like the modern French word ''[[wikt:chanteur#French|chanteur]]''.\n\n==== Chanter reed ====\nThe note from the chanter is produced by a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] installed at its top. The reed may be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or [[double reed]] (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.\n\n=== Drone ===\n[[File:FIL 2016 - The City Of Auckland Pipe Band - 4780.webm|thumb|Bagpipes players from ''The City Of Auckland Pipe Band''.]]\nMost bagpipes have at least one [[drone (music)|drone]]: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.\n\nDepending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient origins ===\nThe evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The ''Oxford History of Music''  says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a [[Hittites|Hittite]] slab at [[Euyuk]] in the Middle East, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the [[ancient Greek]] ''askaulos'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''askos'' &ndash; [[wine-skin]], \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 ''[[aulos]]'' &ndash; reed pipe) with the bagpipe.<ref name=\"google15\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOfuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 William Flood. \"The Story of the Bagpipe\" p. 15]</ref>  In the 2nd century AD, [[Suetonius]] described the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a player of the ''tibia utricularis''.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = ''Life of Nero'', 54\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#54\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = Suetonius, The Lives of the Caesars\n | page        = 185\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref> [[Dio Chrysostom]] wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe ([[Tibia (instrument)|tibia]], Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = Discourses by Dio Chrysostom (Or.&nbsp;71.9)\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#9\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = The Seventy-first Discourse: On the Philosopher (Volume V)\n | volume      = V\n | page        = 173\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Spread and development in Europe ===\n[[File:Santes Creus Bagpiper.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval bagpiper at the [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Santes Creus]], Catalonia, Spain]]\n[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|right|thumb|''Image of Irelande'', Military use of the bagpipe dated 1581]]\n\nIn the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography.

In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's ''Compleat Theory''. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a [[William Dixon manuscript|William Dixon]] from [[Northumberland]] contains music that fits the [[border pipes]], a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern [[Great Highland bagpipe]]. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of [[Northumbrian smallpipe]] tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.\n[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right||''[[Happy Brothers]]'' by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] (1887)]]\nAs Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.\n\nExtensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]], Spain, the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford, England and the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]] in Northumberland, and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Canadian soldier plays the bagpipes during the War in Afghanistan. Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among fire department, military and police forces in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth realms, and the US.]]\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well-known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Nations such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the [[Great Highland bagpipe]] is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.\n\n[[File:Bagad Brest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bagad]] in [[Brest, France]]]]\nIn recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Galician bagpipe|Galician gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' and the theatrical show ''[[Riverdance]]'' have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.\n\nBagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of [[curling]], bagpipes are also the official instrument of the [[World Curling Federation]] and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.\n\nBagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{Citation\n | first       = Caroline\n | last        = Jaine\n | authorlink  =\n | title       = Doing business with Pakistan\n | url         = http://www.dawn.com/news/663807/doing-business-with-pakistan\n | publisher   = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | date        = 2011-10-04\n | accessdate  = 2013-02-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | last        = Abbas\n | first       = Nosheen\n | title       = The thriving bagpipe business of Pakistan\n | url         = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20876096\n | publisher   = [[BBC News Online]]\n | location    = [[Pakistan]]\n | date        = 2012-12-31\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n }}</ref> In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented.

The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Portuguese [[gaita transmontana]], the Aragonese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[cimpoi]],  the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.\n\nTraditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.\n\n====Image gallery====\n<gallery>\nFile:BulgarianKabaGaidaPlayer.jpg|Bulgarian [[Kaba gaida]] player\nFile:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|The Scottish Great Highland bagpipe played at a Canadian military function\nFile:Baghet suonatore.jpg|A musician with a Northern Italian [[Bagh\u00e8t]] wearing traditional dress.\nFile:A modern model of Bagh\u00e8t.png|Modern baghet (made 2000 by Valter Biella) in Sol/G\nFile:Zampogna.jpg|Central and southern Italian [[zampogna]]\nFile:Tulumcu.jpg|Laz man from Turkey playing a [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]]\nFile:Cillian Vallely on Uilleann Pipes.jpg|[[Cillian Vallely]] playing Irish [[Uilleann pipes]]\nFile:Tickell 2004.jpg|[[Northumbrian smallpipes]]\nFile:Gaida.jpg|Man from Skopje, Macedonia playing the [[Gaida]]\nFile:Seivane1.jpg|[[Galician gaita]]\nFile:Sruti upanga.jpg|[[Sruti upanga]], a Southern Indian bagpipe\nFile:Duda Bagpipe 001.jpg|Hungarian [[duda]]\nFile:Serbian bagpiper.jpg|Serbian piper\nFile:DudyWielkopolskie.jpg|Polish pipers\nFile:Bagad.JPG|[[Bagad]] of Lann Bihou\u00e9 from the French Navy\nFile:Ollegallmo.jpg|Swedish [[s\u00e4ckpipa]]\nFile:Pastoral pipes removable foot joint.JPG|[[Pastoral pipes]] with removable footjoint and bellows\nFile:Street-piper.jpg|Street piper from Sofia, Bulgaria\nFile:Torupillim\u00e4ngija.jpg|Estonian piper\nFile:Lithuanian bagpipes.png|Lithuanian piper\nFile:Modern huemmelchen.jpg|Modern German [[huemmelchen]]\nFile:Lietuvi\u0161kas d\u016bdmai\u0161is (LNM).jpg|Lithuanian bagpipes\nFile:Al son de la gaita.jpg|[[Gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]]\nFile:Pibecwd.jpg|Welsh bagpipe (double-reed type)\nFile:Gaiteroscantabria.jpg|Cantabrian pipe band\nFile:Bagpipe player damascus.jpg|Syrian piper in Damascus, Syria\nFile:Tsambouna.jpg|Various forms of the [[Tsampouna]], found in the Greek islands\nFile:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0456\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0435.jpg|Belarusian piper\nFile:A \u017caqq (bagpipe), made from calf pelt, cane, and animal horn.jpg|Maltese [[\u017baqq]]\nFile:Bagpipe player Dam.jpg|Man playing the bagpipe on Dam square. background: [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]], Netherlands\nFile:Cimpoi.png|Romanian [[cimpoi]] player\nFile:\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka gra na dudach.webm|\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka playing bagpipes, Slovak Republic\n</gallery>\n\n=== Usage in non-traditional music ===\n{{Main|List of nontraditional bagpipe usage}}\n[[File:Enter The Haggis Bagpipe.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] featuring Highland bagpipes]]\nSince the 1960s, bagpipes have also made [[List of nontraditional bagpipe usage|appearances in other forms of music]], including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", [[AC/DC]]'s \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]\", and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s composition ''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]''. <!--STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE EXAMPLES TO BE PLACED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, PARTICULARLY AS THERE IS A LINK TO A COMPREHENSIVE LIST.

Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first [[enzyme]], [[diastase]] (today called [[amylase]]), in 1833 by [[Anselme Payen]],<ref>[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), p. 75.</ref> while others considered [[Eduard Buchner]]'s first demonstration of a complex biochemical process [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry.<ref>[[#Hamblin|Hamblin]] (2005), p. 26.</ref><ref>[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), pp. 96\u201398.</ref>  Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by [[Justus von Liebig]], ''Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology'', which presented a chemical theory of metabolism,<ref name=\"history of science\" /> or even earlier to the 18th century studies on [[fermentation]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] by [[Antoine Lavoisier]].<ref>[[#Berg|Berg]] (1980), pp. 1\u20132.</ref><ref>[[#Holmes|Holmes]] (1987), p. xv.</ref> Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] for his work on the chemistry of proteins,<ref>[[#Feldman|Feldman]] (2001), p. 206.</ref> and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|F. Gowland Hopkins]] on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.<ref>[[#Rayner|Rayner-Canham]] (2005), p. 136.</ref>\n\nThe term \"biochemistry\" itself  is derived from a combination of [[biology]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1877, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]] used the term (''biochemie'' in German) as a synonym for [[physiological chemistry]] in the foreword to the first issue of ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie]]'' (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study.<ref>[[#Ziesak|Ziesak]] (1999), p. 169.</ref><ref>[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 116.</ref> The German [[chemist]] [[Carl Neuberg]] however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903,<ref name=\"Ben-Menahem 2009\">[[#Ben|Ben-Menahem]] (2009), p. 2982.</ref><ref>[[#Amsler|Amsler]] (1986), p. 55.</ref><ref>[[#Horton|Horton]] (2013), p. 36.</ref> while some credited it to [[Franz Hofmeister]].<ref>[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:DNA orbit animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|DNA structure ({{PDB2|1D65}})<ref>[[#Edwards|Edwards]] (1992), pp. 1161\u20131173.</ref>]]\nIt was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the \"[[vital principle]]\") distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life.<ref>[[#Fiske|Fiske]] (1890), pp. 419\u201320.</ref> Then, in 1828, [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] published a paper on [[W\u00f6hler synthesis|the synthesis]] of [[urea]], proving that [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds can be created artificially.<ref name=\"Kauffman 2001\">[[#Kauffman|Kauffman]] (2001), pp. 121\u2013133.</ref>  Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as [[chromatography]], [[X-ray diffraction]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]], [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], [[radioisotopic labeling]], [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], and [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and [[metabolic pathway]]s of the [[cell (biology)|cell]], such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding of biochemistry on a molecular level.\n\nAnother significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the [[gene]] and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called [[molecular biology]].<ref>[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), p. 2.</ref> In the 1950s, [[James D.

Most [[Rare earth element|rare elements on Earth]] are not needed by life (exceptions being  [[selenium]] and [[iodine]]), while a few common ones ([[aluminum]] and [[titanium]]) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between [[plants]] and [[animals]]. For example, ocean algae use [[bromine]], but land plants and animals seem to need none. All animals require [[sodium]], but some plants do not. Plants need [[boron]] and [[silicon]], but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).\n\nJust six elements&mdash;[[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]&mdash;make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see [[composition of the human body]] for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.<ref>[[#Nielsen|Nielsen]] (1999), pp. 283\u2013303.</ref>\n\n==Biomolecules==\n{{main|Biomolecule}}\nThe four main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called [[biomolecule]]s) are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s.<ref name=slabaugh>[[#Slabaugh|Slabaugh]] (2007), pp. 3\u20136.</ref> Many biological molecules are [[polymer]]s: in this terminology, [[monomer]]s are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large [[macromolecule]]s known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a [[Biopolymer|biological polymer]], they undergo a process called [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for [[biological activity]].\n\n===Carbohydrates===\n{{Main article|Carbohydrate|Monosaccharide|Disaccharide|Polysaccharide}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = [[Carbohydrates]]\n| image1    = Beta-D-Glucose.svg\n| width1    = 220\n| caption1 = Glucose, a [[monosaccharide]]\n| image2   = Sucrose-inkscape.svg\n| width2   = 220\n| caption2 = A molecule of [[sucrose]] ([[glucose]] + [[fructose]]), a [[disaccharide]]\n| image3   = amylose 3Dprojection.corrected.png\n| width3   = 220\n| caption3 =[[Amylose]],  a [[polysaccharide]] made up of several thousand [[glucose]] units\n}}\nThe function of carbohydrates includes energy storage and providing structure. [[Sugar]]s are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and [[genetic information]], as well as play important roles in cell to [[Cell\u2013cell interaction|cell interactions]] and [[Cell signaling|communications]].\n\nThe simplest type of carbohydrate is a [[monosaccharide]], which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''</sub>O<sub>''n''</sub>, where ''n'' is at least 3). [[Glucose]]  (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include [[fructose]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), the sugar commonly associated with the [[sweet taste]] of [[fruit]]s,<ref name=Whiting1970>[[#Whiting|Whiting]] (1970), pp. 1\u201331.</ref>{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[deoxyribose]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).  A monosaccharide can switch between [[Open-chain compound|acyclic (open-chain) form]] and a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] form.  The open-chain form can be turned into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an [[oxygen]] atom created from the [[carbonyl group]] of one end and the [[hydroxyl]] group of another. The cyclic molecule has an [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]] group, depending on whether the linear form was an [[aldose]] or a [[ketose]].<ref>[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 358\u2013359.</ref>\n\n[[File:Existence in solution.png|center|thumb|500px|Conversion between the [[furanose]], [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]], and [[pyranose]] forms of D-glucose]]\n\nIn these cyclic forms, the ring usually has '''5''' or '''6''' atoms.  These forms are called [[furanose]]s and [[pyranose]]s, respectively&nbsp;\u2014 by analogy with [[furan]] and [[pyran]], the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the [[double bond]]s of these two molecules).  For example, the aldohexose [[glucose]] may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called [[glucofuranose]].  The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called [[glucopyranose]]. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring called [[heptoses]] are rare.\n\nTwo monosaccharides can be joined together by a [[Glycosidic bond|glycosidic]] or [[ether bond]] into a ''[[disaccharide]]'' through a [[dehydration reaction]] during which a molecule of water is released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed ''[[hydrolysis]]''.  The best-known disaccharide is [[sucrose]] or ordinary [[sugar]], which consists of a [[glucose]] molecule and a [[fructose]] molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is [[lactose]] found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a [[galactose]] molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by [[lactase]], and deficiency in this enzyme results in [[lactose intolerance]].\n\nWhen a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an ''[[oligosaccharide]]'' (''oligo-'' meaning \"few\"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and [[Cell signaling|signals]], as well as having some other uses.<ref name=Varki_1999>[[#Varki|Varki]] (1999), p. 17.</ref> Many monosaccharides joined together make a [[polysaccharide]]. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branched]]. Two of the most common polysaccharides are [[cellulose]] and [[glycogen]], both consisting of repeating glucose [[monomer]]s.  Examples are ''cellulose'' which is an important structural component of plant's [[cell wall]]s, and ''[[glycogen]]'', used as a form of energy storage in animals.\n\n[[Sugar]] can be characterized by having [[Reducing sugar|reducing]] or non-reducing ends. A [[reducing end]] of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain [[aldehyde]] ([[aldose]]) or keto form ([[ketose]]). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the [[pyranose]] or [[furanose]] form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full [[acetal]]. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. [[Saccharose]] does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).\n\n===Lipids===\n{{Main article|Lipid|Glycerol|Fatty acid}}\n\n[[File:Common lipids lmaps.png|thumb|right|320px|Structures of some common lipids. At the top are [[cholesterol]] and [[oleic acid]].<ref>[[#Stryer|Stryer]] (2007), p. 328.</ref> The middle structure is a [[triglyceride]] composed of [[oleate|oleoyl]], [[stearate|stearoyl]], and [[palmitate|palmitoyl]] chains attached to a [[glycerol]] backbone. At the bottom is the common [[phospholipid]], [[phosphatidylcholine]].<ref>[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 12 Lipids and Membranes.</ref>]]\n\n'''[[Lipid]]s''' comprises a diverse range of [[molecules]] and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or [[nonpolar]] compounds of biological origin, including [[wax]]es, [[fatty acid]]s, fatty-acid derived [[phospholipid]]s, [[sphingolipid]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, and [[terpenoid]]s (e.g., [[retinoid]]s and [[steroid]]s). Some lipids are linear [[aliphatic]] molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are [[aromatic]], while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.<ref>[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 22\u201327.</ref>\n\nLipids are usually made from one molecule of [[glycerol]] combined with other molecules.  In [[triglyceride]]s, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three [[fatty acid]]s. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] (no [[double bond]]s in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).<ref>[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 382\u2013385.</ref>\n\nMost lipids have some [[polar molecule|polar]] character in addition to being largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or [[hydrophobic]] (\"water-fearing\"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or [[hydrophilic]] (\"water-loving\") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them [[amphiphilic]] molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of [[cholesterol]], the polar group is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.<ref>[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 385\u2013389.</ref>\n\nLipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most [[oil]]s and [[milk product]]s that we use for cooking and eating like [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[ghee]] etc., are composed of [[fat]]s. [[Vegetable oil]]s are rich in various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.  Lipids, especially [[phospholipid]]s, are also used in various [[pharmaceutical product]]s, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] infusions) or else as [[drug carrier]] components (e.g., in a [[liposome]] or [[transfersome]]).\n\n===Proteins===\n{{Main article|Protein|Amino acid}}\n\n[[File:AminoAcidball.svg|thumbnail|160px|The general structure of an \u03b1-amino acid, with the [[amine|amino]] group on the left and the [[carboxyl]] group on the right.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are very large molecules \u2013 macro-biopolymers \u2013 made from monomers called [[amino acid]]s. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom attached to an [[amino]] group, &mdash;NH<sub>2</sub>, a [[carboxylic acid]] group, &mdash;COOH (although these exist as &mdash;NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and &mdash;COO<sup>\u2212</sup> under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom, and a side chain commonly denoted as \"&mdash;R\". The side chain  \"R\" is different for each amino acid of which there are 20 [[proteinogenic amino acid|standard ones]].  It is this \"R\" group that made each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains greatly influence the overall [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional conformation]] of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, [[glutamate]] functions as an important [[neurotransmitter]]. Amino acids can be joined via a [[peptide bond]]. In this [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a ''[[dipeptide]]'', and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called ''peptides'' or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title ''proteins''. As an example, the important blood [[blood plasma|serum]] protein [[human serum albumin|albumin]] contains 585 amino acid residues.<ref name=\"Metzler 2001\">[[#Metzler|Metzler]] (2001), p. 58.</ref>\n[[File:Amino acids 1.png|thumb|left|390px|Generic amino acids (1) in neutral form, (2) as they exist physiologically, and (3) joined together as a dipeptide.]]\n\n[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|160px|A schematic of [[hemoglobin]]. The red and blue ribbons represent the protein [[globin]]; the green structures are the [[heme]] groups.]]\nProteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements of the proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules&mdash;they may be ''extremely'' selective in what they bind. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation based on differences in the N-terminal domain. <ref>{{Cite journal|date=2010-04-01|title=How antibodies fold|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000409002291|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=189\u2013198|doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2009.11.005|issn=0968-0004|pmc=4716677}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the [[enzyme]]s. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called ''[[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s''; they then [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the reaction between them. By lowering the [[activation energy]], the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10<sup>11</sup> or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.\n\nThe structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The [[primary structure]] of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, \"alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-\u2026\". [[Secondary structure]] is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an [[alpha helix|\u03b1-helix]] or into a sheet called a [[Beta sheet|\u03b2-sheet]]; some \u03b1-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. [[Tertiary structure]] is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the [[glutamate]] residue at position 6 with a [[valine]] residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in [[sickle-cell disease]]. Finally, [[quaternary structure]] is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.<ref>[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 35\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[File:Protein structure examples.png|thumb|800px|center|Examples of protein structures from the [[Protein Data Bank]]]]\n[[File:Structural coverage of the human cyclophilin family.png|thumb|350px|right|Members of a protein family, as represented by the structures of the [[isomerase]] [[protein domain|domain]]s]]\nIngested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the [[small intestine]], and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]]. These are the [[essential amino acid]]s, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize [[alanine]], [[asparagine]], [[aspartate]], [[cysteine]], [[glutamate]], [[glutamine]], [[glycine]], [[proline]], [[serine]], and [[tyrosine]], the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize [[arginine]] and [[histidine]], they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.\n\nIf the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an \u03b1-[[keto acid]]. Enzymes called [[transaminase]]s can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an \u03b1-keto acid) to another \u03b1-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the \u03b1-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via [[transamination]]. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.<ref>[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 279\u2013292.</ref>\n\nA similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), existing as the [[ammonium]] ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. [[Unicellular]] organisms simply release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, [[osteichthyes|bony fish]] can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the [[urea cycle]].<ref name=\"Sherwood 2012\">[[#Sherwood|Sherwood]] (2012), p. 558.</ref>\n\nIn order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like [[sequence alignment]]s and [[structural alignment]]s are powerful tools that help scientists identify [[Sequence homology|homologies]] between related molecules.<ref name=\"Fariselli 2007\">[[#Fariselli|Fariselli]] (2007), pp. 78\u201387.</ref>  The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of [[Protein family|protein families]]. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.\n\n===Nucleic acids===\n{{Main article|Nucleic acid|DNA|RNA|Nucleotide}}\n[[File:0322 DNA Nucleotides.jpg|thumbnail|350px|The structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA), the picture shows the monomers being put together.]]\n\n[[Nucleic acids]], so called because of their prevalence in cellular [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey [[genetic information]] in all living cells and viruses.<ref name=\"Voet_2005\"/> The monomers are called [[nucleotide]]s, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic [[base (chemistry)|base]] (either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]]), a pentose sugar, and a [[phosphate]] group.<ref>[[#Saenger|Saenger]] (1984), p. 84.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nucleotides 1.svg|thumb|center|500px|Structural elements of common nucleic acid constituents. Because they contain at least one phosphate group, the compounds marked ''nucleoside monophosphate'', ''nucleoside diphosphate'' and ''nucleoside triphosphate'' are all nucleotides (not simply phosphate-lacking [[nucleoside]]s).]]\n\nThe most common nucleic acids are [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA).<ref>[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), pp. 5\u20139.</ref> The [[phosphate group]] and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]].  The [[nitrogenous base]]s of each strand of a nucleic acid will form [[hydrogen bonds]] with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.\n\nAside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as [[second messenger]]s, as well as forming the base molecule for [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms.<ref>[[#Knowles|Knowles]] (1980), pp. 877\u2013919.</ref> Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.\n\n==Metabolism==\n\n===Carbohydrates as energy source===\n{{Main article|Carbohydrate metabolism}}\nGlucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers ([[glycogen phosphorylase]] removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.\n\n====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====\n{{Glycolysis summary}}\nGlucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]] called [[glycolysis]], the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of [[pyruvate]]. This also produces a net two molecules of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate (lactic acid)]] (e.g., in humans) or to [[ethanol]] plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in [[yeast]]). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.<ref>[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 163\u2013180.</ref>\n\n====Aerobic====\nIn [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to [[acetyl-CoA]], giving off one carbon atom as the waste product [[carbon dioxide]], generating another reducing equivalent as [[NADH]]. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the [[citric acid cycle]], producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via [[FADH2|FADH<sub>2</sub>]] as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an [[electron transport system]] transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane ([[inner mitochondrial membrane]] in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD<sup>+</sup> and [[quinone]] are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional ''28'' molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle).<ref>[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 17 Glycolysis.</ref> It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.\n\n====Gluconeogenesis====\n{{Main article|Gluconeogenesis}}\nIn [[vertebrate]]s, vigorously contracting [[skeletal muscle]]s (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], converting glucose to lactate. The [[liver]] regenerates the glucose, using a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or [[starch]] in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the [[Cori cycle]].<ref>[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 183\u2013194.</ref>\n\n==Relationship to other \"molecular-scale\" biological sciences==\n[[File:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic relationship between biochemistry, [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]].]]\n\nResearchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biophysics]]. There has never been a hard-line among these disciplines in terms of content and technique. Today, the terms ''molecular biology'' and ''biochemistry'' are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:\n\n* ''Biochemistry'' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecule]]s. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.\n* ''Genetics'' is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g., one [[gene]]), in the study of \"[[mutant]]s\" &ndash; organisms with a changed gene that leads to the organism being different with respect to the so-called \"[[wild type]]\" or normal [[phenotype]]. [[Genetic interactions]] ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such \"knock-out\" or \"knock-in\" studies.\n* ''Molecular biology'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the [[genetic material]]. The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].<ref name=\"Ulveling 2011\">[[#Ulveling|Ulveling]] (2011), pp. 633\u2013644.</ref>\n* ''[[Chemical biology]]'' seeks to develop new tools based on [[small molecule]]s that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied [[viral capsid]]s that can deliver [[gene therapy]] or [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug molecules]]).<ref>[[#Rojas|Rojas-Ruiz]] (2011), pp. 2672\u20132687.</ref>\n\n== See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Biochemistry: An introduction}}\n{{Main article|Outline of biochemistry}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Biochemistry|Important publications in biochemistry (chemistry)]]\n* [[List of biochemistry topics]]\n* [[List of biochemists]]\n* [[List of biomolecules]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== See also ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Biochemistry (journal)]]\n* [[Biological Chemistry (journal)]]\n* [[Biophysics]]\n* [[Chemical ecology]]\n* [[Computational biomodeling]]\n* [[Enzyme Commission number|EC number]]\n* [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry]]\n* [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]]\n* [[Metabolome]]\n* [[Metabolomics]]\n* [[Molecular biology]]\n* [[Molecular medicine]]\n* [[Plant biochemistry]]\n* [[Proteolysis]]\n* [[Small molecule]]\n* [[Structural biology]]\n* [[TCA cycle]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits.

Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are \"singles\" (with one player per side) and \"doubles\" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.\n\nEach side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.{{sfnp|Boga|2008}}\n\nThe shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher [[drag (physics)|drag]], causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.\n\nThe game developed in [[British India]] from the earlier game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. European play came to be dominated by [[Denmark]] but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by [[China]]. Since 1992, badminton has been a [[Summer Olympics|Summer]] [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]] with [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|four events]]: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Olympic Badminton The Olympic Journey|url=http://olympics.bwfbadminton.com/history/|website=bwfbadminton.com|publisher=Badminton World Federation|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require [[Aerobic conditioning|aerobic stamina]], [[agility]], strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good [[motor coordination]] and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.{{sfnp|Grice|2008}}\n\n{{anchor|Development}}\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Battledore - Youthful Sports.png|thumb|right|upright|An 1804 depiction of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]]]\n\n[[File:Battledore-and-shuttlecock.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An 1854 depiction of [[battledore and shuttlecock]] by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]]]\n\nGames employing [[shuttlecock]]s have been played for centuries across [[Eurasia]],{{efn|Other related sports include [[Hanetsuki]], which originated in [[Japan]].}} but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the [[British people|British]] as a variant of the earlier game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. (\"Battledore\" was an older term for \"racquet\".){{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the [[Duke of Beaufort]]'s [[Badminton House]] in [[Gloucestershire]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named [[Isaac Spratt]] published a booklet entitled ''Badminton Battledore \u2013 A New Game'', but no copy is known to have survived.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} An 1863 article in ''The Cornhill Magazine'' describes badminton as \"battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground\".<ref name=oed>{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=badminton, ''n.'' }}</ref>\n\nThe game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in [[British India]],{{sfnp|Guillain|2004|p=47}} where it was very popular by the 1870s.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} [[Ball badminton]], a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Thanjavur]] as early as the 1850s<ref>{{citation |contribution=About Game<!--sic--> |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210120/http://ballbadmintonfederationofindia.com/about_game.html |title=Ball Badminton Federation of India |date=2008 |accessdate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.\n\nEarly on, the game was also known as '''Poona''' or '''Poonah''' after the garrison town of [[Pune]],{{sfnp|Guillain|2004|p=47}}{{sfnp|Connors, et al.|1991|p=195}} where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}}<ref name=oed/>{{efn|''Against this'', Downey, Jake, [[et al]] claim that the first rules were drawn up at [[Karachi]] in 1877.{{sfnp|Downey, Jake et al.|1982|p=13}}}} By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in [[Folkestone]]. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The shuttlecocks were coated with [[India rubber]] and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with [[lead]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}\n\nThe sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the [[Bath, England|Bath]] Badminton Club drew up revised regulations.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules.{{sfnp|Adams|1980}} The [[Badminton England|Badminton Association]] of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called \"Dunbar\"{{efn|6 Waverley Grove, [[Portsmouth]], [[England]].<ref name=hist/>}} in [[Portsmouth]] on 13 September.<ref name=hist>{{citation |contribution=The History of Badminton: Foundation of the BAE and Codification of the Rules |contribution-url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/newsite/History/index.html |title=World Badminton |url=http://www.worldbadminton.com }}</ref> The BAE started the first badminton competition, the [[All England Open Badminton Championships]] for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an [[England]]\u2013[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] championship match appeared in 1904.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}\n\nEngland, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[New Zealand]] were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the [[Badminton World Federation]]. [[India]] joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[South Korea]] are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.\n\nThe game has also become a popular backyard sport in the [[United States]].\n\n==Rules==\n\nThe following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, ''Laws of Badminton''.<ref name=laws>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14915|title=Laws of Badminton|publisher=Badminton World Federation}}</ref>\n\n===Court===\n\n[[File:Badminton court 3d.svg|right|thumb|upright|Badminton court, [[isometric projection|isometric]] view]]\n\nThe court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules  permit a court to be marked for singles only.<ref name=laws/>  The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.\n\nThe full width of the court is 6.1&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18&nbsp;metres (17&nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4&nbsp;metres (44&nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98&nbsp;metres (6&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76&nbsp;metres (2&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.\n\nThe net is 1.55&nbsp;metres (5&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524&nbsp;metres (5&nbsp;ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.\n\nThe minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.\n\n===Serving===\n\n[[File:Badminton court legal bounds.svg|right|thumb|upright|The legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games]]\n\nWhen the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.\n\nAt the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite ''service courts'' (see [[#Playing court dimensions|court dimensions]]). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to [[tennis]], except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.\n\nWhen the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a \"second serve\").\n\nIn singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.\n\nIn doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did ''not'' serve last time.\n\n===Scoring===\n{{Main article|Scoring system development of badminton}}\n\nEach game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served<ref name=laws/> (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.\n\nIf the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24\u201322), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.\n\nAt the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.\n\nIn subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.\n\nThe server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.\n\n===Lets===\n\nIf a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.\n\nIf the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:Heads of badminton raquets.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Badminton [[racquet]]s]]\n\nBadminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.\n\n===Racquets===\n\nBadminton [[Racket (sports equipment)|racquets]] are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between {{convert|70|and|95|g|oz|abbr=off}} not including grip or strings.<ref name=oqgysc>{{cite web|url=http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/ |title=Badminton Central Guide to choosing Badminton Equipment|author=Kwun|date=28 February 2005|publisher=BadmintonCentral.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311234023/http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/|archivedate=11 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|title=SL-70|publisher=Karakal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051147/http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|archivedate=16 October 2007}}</ref> They are composed of many different materials ranging from [[carbon fiber composite|carbon fibre composite]] ([[graphite reinforced plastic]]) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. [[carbon fibre |Carbon fibre]] has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent [[kinetic energy]] transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as  [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[fullerene]] are added to racquets giving them greater durability.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThere is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an [[wikt:isometric|isometric]] head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.\n\n===Strings===\n\nBadminton strings are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73&nbsp;mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]] (18 to 36 [[pound-force|lbf]]). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25&nbsp;lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36&nbsp;lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.\n\nIt is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |title=String tension relating to power and control|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028080241/http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |archivedate = 28 October 2007}}</ref> The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is, in fact, incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:<ref name=\"oqgysc\"/> the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.\n[[File:Badminton Undergrip Flat.jpg|thumb|Badminton Undergrip Flat]]\n\n===Grip===\n\nThe choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.\n\nPlayers may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are [[polyurethane|PU]] synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.\n\nThere are two main types of grip: ''replacement'' grips and ''overgrips''. Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1&nbsp;mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.\n\n===Shuttlecock===\n{{stack|float=right|[[File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt]]\n[[File:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shuttlecock]]s with feathers]]}}\n{{Main article|Shuttlecock}}\n\nA shuttlecock (often abbreviated to ''shuttle''; also called a ''birdie'') is a high-drag [[projectile]], with an open [[Cone (geometry)|conical shape]]: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping [[feathers]] embedded into a rounded cork base. The [[Cork (material)|cork]] is covered with thin [[leather]] or synthetic material. [[Nylon (material)|Synthetic]] shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.\n\nBadminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:\n{{quote|'''3.1''': To test a shuttlecock, hit a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the sidelines.\n\n'''3.2''': A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530&nbsp;mm and not more than 990&nbsp;mm short of the other back boundary line.}}\n\n===Shoes===\n\nBadminton [[Athletic shoe|shoes]] are lightweight with soles of [[rubber]] or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.\n\nCompared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little [[support (structure)|lateral support]]. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.\n\n==Technique==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:GGOpen Setiadi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|A female player flies high in USA, 2006]]\n\n===Strokes===\n\nBadminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either ''forehand'' or ''backhand''. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.\n\nIn the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a ''round-the-head'' forehand overhead (a forehand \"on the backhand side\") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The ''backhand clear'' is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, ''backhand smashes'' tend to be weak.\n\n===Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player===\n\n[[File:BadmintonService.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A player does a forehand service, 2009, Philadelphia]]\n\nThe choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. '''In the forecourt''', a high shuttlecock will be met with a ''net kill'', hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. '''In the midcourt''', a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful ''smash'', also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic ''jump smashes'', where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. '''In the rearcourt''', players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This ''overhead'' hitting allows them to play smashes, ''clears'' (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and ''drop shots'' (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.\n\n===Vertical position of the shuttlecock===\n\n[[File:BadmintonJumpSmash.jpg|thumb|upright|A player prepares for a vertical jump smash]]\n\n'''When the shuttlecock is well below net height''', players have no choice but to hit upwards. ''Lifts'', where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this is called a ''net shot''; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a ''push'' or ''block''.\n\n'''When the shuttlecock is near to net height''', players can hit ''drives'', which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rear court. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.\n\n===Spin===\n\nBalls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis) or trajectory, and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racquet face) to produce such spin.  The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, but slicing the shuttlecock does have applications in badminton. (See [[#Basic Strokes|Basic strokes]] for an explanation of technical terms.)\n* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racquet or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.\n* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create drop shots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.\n* When playing a net shot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a ''spinning net shot'' or ''tumbling net shot''. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.\n\nDue to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling net shot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.<ref>{{citation |contribution=The Spin Doctor |title=Power & Precision Magazine |date=July 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Biomechanics===\n\nBadminton [[biomechanics]] have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.{{sfnp|Kim|2002}} Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |contribution=Badminton Technique |title=Badminton England |url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk }}{{cite web |url=http://badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417212505/http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007 |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first and remain in the cork-first orientation.\n\nOne consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (''lobbed'') shuttlecock: the [[parabola]] of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.\n\n===Other factors===\n\n'''When defending against a smash''', players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.\n\n'''The service''' is restricted by [[#Laws of the game|the Laws]] and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a ''low serve'' into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat ''drive serve''. Lifted serves may be either ''high serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or ''flick serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.\n\n===Deception===\n\nOnce players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. \"Deception\" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.\n\n''Slicing'' and using a ''shortened hitting action'' are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt ''sliced drop shot'' will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or a smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create ''spinning net shots'' (also called ''tumbling net shots''), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning net shot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning net shots are especially important for high-level singles players.\n\nThe lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a net shot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as ''finger power''. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=off}} racquet swing.\n\nIt is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rear court (for example, drop shots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as net shots).\n\nDeception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use ''double motion'', where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke crosscourt, or vice versa. ''Triple motion'' is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a ''racquet head fake'', where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction but does not require as much time.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n\nTo win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a net shot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the net shot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.\n\nDeception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.\n\n===Singles===\n\nSince one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.\n\nIn singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.\n\nAt high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.badminton-information.com/rules-of-badminton.html|title=Rules of Badminton|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Doubles===\n\nBoth pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.\n\nAt high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.\n\nAt high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.\n\n===Mixed doubles===\n\n[[File:Scottish Schools U12 mixed doubles badminton tournament.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A mixed doubles game \u2013 Scottish Schools under 12s tournament, [[Tranent]], May 2002]]\n\nIn mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |title=Badminton Strategies and Tactics for the Novice and Recreational Player|last=Kumekawa|first=Eugene|publisher=BadmintonPlanet |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126195758/http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |archivedate = 26 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nAt high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Governing bodies===\n\nThe Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for conduction of tournaments and approaching fair play. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:\n\n* Asia: [[Badminton Asia Confederation]] (BAC)\n* Africa: [[Badminton Confederation of Africa]] (BCA)\n* Americas: [[Badminton Pan Am]] (North America and South America belong to the same confederation; BPA)\n* Europe: [[Badminton Europe]] (BE)\n* Oceania: [[Badminton Oceania]] (BO)\n\n===Competitions===\n\n[[File:Badminton men's doubles.jpg|thumb|upright|A men's doubles match. The blue lines are those for the badminton court. The other coloured lines denote uses for other sports \u2013 such complexity being common in multi-use sports halls.]]\n\nThe BWF organizes several international competitions, including the [[Thomas Cup]], the premier men's international team event first held in [[1949 Thomas Cup|1948\u20131949]], and the [[Uber Cup]], the women's equivalent first held in [[1957 Uber Cup|1956\u20131957]]. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further increased to 16 teams in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas and Uber Cups increased to 16 teams|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/badminton/thomas-and-uber-cups-increased-to-16-teams|website=sportskeeda.com|accessdate=25 June 2017|date=11 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sudirman Cup]], a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like [[association football]] (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system at every level. However, the system was last used in [[2009 Sudirman Cup|2009]] and teams competing will now be grouped by world rankings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sachetat|first1=Rapha\u00ebl|title=Sudirman Cup to Change Format|url=http://www.badzine.net/2009/05/event-sudirman-cup-to-change-format/|website=Badzine|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBadminton was a demonstration event at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. It became an official [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic]] sport at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]] in [[Badminton at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.\n\nIn the [[BWF World Championships]], first held in [[1977 IBF World Championships|1977]], currently only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and [[BWF World Junior Championships|World Junior Championships]]), are all categorized as level one tournaments.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the BWF  introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the [[BWF Super Series]]. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players, stage twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the year-end.

The following is a list of manifest differences:\n* Scoring: In badminton, a match is played best 2 of 3 games, with each game played up to 21 points. In tennis a match is played best of 3 or 5 sets, each set consisting of 6 games and each game ends when one player wins 4 points or wins two consecutive points at deuce points.  If both teams are tied at \"game point\", they must play until one team achieves a two-point advantage.  However, at 29{{ndash}}all, whoever scores the golden point will win. In tennis, if the score is tied 6{{ndash}}6 in a set, a tiebreaker will be played, which ends once a player reaches 7 points or when one player has a two-point advantage.\n* In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the point ends; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.\n* In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games (at advanced level & onwards); a ''break'' of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an ''ace'' (unreturnable serve).\n* In tennis, the server has two chances to hit a serve into the service box; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.\n* A tennis court is approximately twice the length and width of a badminton court.\n* Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, {{convert|10|to|12|oz|g|abbr=off}} versus {{convert|2|to|3|oz|g|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.about.com/od/tennisracquetsfaq/f/faqracquets43.htm|title=What is the ideal weight for a tennis racquet?|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |title=The contribution of technology on badminton rackets|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011150444/http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref> Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, {{convert|57|g|oz|abbr=off}} versus {{convert|5|g|oz|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ShefiuAzeez.shtml|title=Mass of a Tennis Ball|year=2000|last=Azeez|first=Shefiu|publisher=Hypertextbook}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/physics/jrIS/Files/McCreary.pdf |title=A Study of the Motion of a Free Falling Shuttlecock |format=PDF |last=M.

For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.\n\nWhile fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during gameplay.\n\nBadminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis, the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=off}}. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.\n\n==See also==\n\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Badminton}}\n* [[Ball badminton]]\n* [[Hanetsuki]]\n* [[List of racquet sports]]\n* [[Speed badminton]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last=Adams |first=Bernard |url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/text/history.txt |title=The Badminton Story |publisher=BBC Books |date=1980 |isbn=0563164654 }}\n* {{citation |last=Boga |first=Steve |title=Badminton |publisher=Paw Prints |date=2008 |isbn=1439504784 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Badminton (game) |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |page=189 }}\n* {{citation |last=Connors |first=M. |author2-last=Dupuis |author2-first=D.L. |author3-last=Morgan |author3-first=B. |ref={{harvid|Connors, et al.|1991}} |date=1991 |title=The Olympics Factbook: A Spectator's Guide to the Winter and Summer Games |publisher=Visible Ink Press |isbn=0-8103-9417-0 }}.\n* {{citation |last=Downey |first=Jake |author2-last=Downey |author2-first=Jason Charles |ref={{harvid|Downey, et al.|1982}} |date=1982 |title=Better Badminton for All |publisher=Pelham Books |isbn=978-0-7207-1438-8 }}.\n* {{citation |last=Grice |first=Tony |title=Badminton: Steps to Success |publisher=Human Kinetics |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-7360-7229-8 }}\n* {{citation |last=Guillain |first=Jean-Yves |title=Badminton: An Illustrated History |publisher=Publibook |date=2004 |isbn=2-7483-0572-8 }}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |last=Jones |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Jones (writer)  |wstitle=Badminton |volume=3  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=228 }}\n* {{citation|last=Kim |first=Wangdo |date=2002 |url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/PG02259480/badminton_smash.pdf |title=An Analysis of the Biomechanics of Arm Movement During a Badminton Smash |publisher=Nanyang Technological University |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002223945/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/PG02259480/badminton_smash.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=dmy }}.\n\n==External links==\n\n{{wikimedia|collapsible=true|c=Category:Badminton|voy=no|species=no|d=Q7291}}\n<!-- Note to editors, unimportant external links will be deleted immediately -->\n* {{Dmoz|Sports/Badminton/|Badminton}}\n* [http://www.bwfbadminton.org/ Badminton World Federation]\n** [http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14915 Laws of Badminton]\n** [http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14914 Simplified Rules]\n* [http://www.badmintonasia.org/ Badminton Asia Confederation]\n* [http://www.badmintonpanam.org/ Badminton Pan Am]\n* [http://www.oceaniabadminton.org/ Badminton Oceania]\n* [http://www.badmintoneurope.com/ Badminton Europe]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080410081244/http://www.badmintonafrica.org/ Badminton Confederation of Africa]\n\n{{International Badminton}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Badminton| ]]\n[[Category:Racquet sports]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic sports]]\n[[Category:Sports originating in South Asia]]", "sha1": "hks7r7g8yxpr9twpqtbdon405dr30rf"}}, {"title": "Baroque", "ns": "0", "id": "3957", "revision": {"id": "865434441", "parentid": "864792994", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T22:51:41Z", "contributor": {"ip": "148.85.254.9"}, "comment": "/* End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery */Fixed typo", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox art movement\n| name         = The Baroque\n| image        = {{photomontage\n|photo1a=Bernini Baldachino.jpg\n|photo1b=\n|photo1c=\n|photo2a=\n|photo2b=LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg\n|photo2c=Peter Paul Rubens - The Adoration of the Magi - WGA20244.jpg\n|photo3a=Wieskirche 003.JPG\n|photo3b=\n|photo3c=\n| size = 300\n| color_border = #AAAAAA\n| color =  #F9F9F9 \n| caption=\n| foot_montage = }}</center>\n| alt          = \n| caption      = Baldachino of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] by [[Bernini]]; Louis XIV by [[Bernini]];''Adoration of the Magi'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]; [[Wieskirche]], Bavaria\n| yearsactive  = 17th\u201318th century\n| country      = Europe and Latin America\n }}\n\nThe '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|\u0259|\u02c8|r|o\u028a|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u0252|k}}) is a highly ornate and often extravagant [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century.  It followed the [[Renaissance style]] and preceded the [[Rococo]] (in the past often referred to as \"late Baroque\") and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. It was encouraged by the [[Catholic Church]] as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of [[Protestant]] architecture, art and music, though [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed in parts of Europe as well.<ref name=\"Heal2011\">{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=\u2018Better Papist than Calvinist\u2019: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}</ref> The Baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.  The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called ''[[rocaille]]'' or ''[[Rococo]]'', which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.\n\n==Origin of word==\nThe word ''baroque'' was a Portuguese term for a pearl (barocco) with an irregular shape. Cognates for the term in other Romance languages include: ''barroco'' in Portuguese, ''barrueco''<!--Antes de corregir esto al \"barroco\", por favor, verifique la fuente citada, y tenga en cuenta que esta palabra es un sustantivo que significa \"perla barroca\".--> in Spanish, and ''barocco'' in Italian.<ref> Oxford English Dictionary on-line definition of Baroque</ref> It was used in French to describe pearls in a 1531 inventory of [[Charles V of France|Charles V's]] treasures.<ref>[https://books.google.es/books?id=CMdwCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR28&lpg=PR28&dq=baroque+1531+Oxford+English+Dictionary&source=bl&ots=zptCm4Wxki&sig=45xkAmnoROBehwvsaY3xADkg_jc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjE1rnTsNDYAhULtRQKHZrrBXQQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&q=baroque%201531%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary&f=false Michael Meere, ''French Renaissance and Baroque Drama: Text, Performance, Theory''], Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, {{ISBN|1611495490}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, the term was usually used to describe music.  In an anonymous satirical review of the premi\u00e8re of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' in October 1733, which was printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was \"du barocque\", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.<ref>Claude V. Palisca, \"Baroque\". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher,  wrote in 1768 in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'':   \"Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\">''Encyclopedie''; ''Lettre sur la Musique Francaise'' under the direction of [[Denis Diderot]]</ref>\n\nThe word was first used to describe the period of art that followed the [[Renaissance]] in 1855 by the Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in an article in the journal ''[[Cicerone|Le Cicerone]]''. He used the term to attack the movement for subverting the values of the Renaissance.<ref>Hopkins, Owen, \"Les Styles en Architecture'', (2014), p. 70</ref>  The term \"style baroque\" did not enter into the [[Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|dictionary]] of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] until 1878, when it lost its original negative connotation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |chapter=What is Baroque? |title=Three Essays on Style |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |page=19 |ref=harv}}</ref>  In 1888, the art historian [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]] published the first serious academic work on the style, ''Renaissance und Barock'', which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.<ref>Hopkins, Owen, ''Les Styles en Architecture'' (2014), p. 70</ref>\n\n==Architecture: origins and characteristics==\n{{Main|Baroque architecture}}\n[[File:Triumph of the Name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Quadratura'' or [[trompe-l'\u0153il]]  ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] (1669\u20131683)]]\nThe Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the [[Catholic Church]] at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545\u201363, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The first phase of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers.  The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement.<ref>Hughes, J.

Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther\u2019s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer\u2019s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany\u2019s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin\u2019s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city\u2019s Cathedral.}}</ref>\n\nBaroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven.<ref>Ducher, pg. 102</ref>\nAnother feature of baroque churches are the ''quadratura''; [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. ''Quadratura'' paintings of [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church.  Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective,  to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.\n\nThe interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque,  and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome.  The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] (1647\u201353) and the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|Baldachino of St. Peter]] (1623\u201334), both by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy.<ref name=\"Ducher pages 106-107\">Ducher (1988) p. 106-107</ref> The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was \"compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter\u2019s in Rome\".<ref name=\"Heal2011\"/>\n\nThe twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.\nThe [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration.  These were large plaques of carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.<ref>Ducher (1988), pg. 102</ref>\n\nBaroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions.  For the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.\n\n===Italian Baroque architecture===\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (early17th century)]]\n[[File:Santa Maria della Salute in Venice 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice (1631\u20131687)]]\nThe first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]] in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.\n\nIn Rome in 1605, [[Paul V]] became the first of series of [[popes]] who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects.<ref>Cabanne (1988) page 12</ref> Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1606\u20131619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.<ref>Ducher (1988)</ref>\n\nIn the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes [[Urban VIII]] and [[Alexander VII]]. The sculptor and architect [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater.<ref name=\"Ducher page 104\">Ducher (1988) p. 104.</ref>\n\nAnother major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose major work was the Church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634\u201346).  The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.<ref name=\"Ducher page 104\"/>\n\nPainted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included ''The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise'' by [[Andrea Pozzo]] (1685\u20131695) in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of Saint Ignatius]] in Rome, and ''The triumph of the name of Jesus'' by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] in the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]] in Rome (1669\u20131683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.<ref>Cabanne (1988) page 15</ref>\nThe style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy:  It appeared in Venice in the church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] (1631\u20131687) by [[Baldassare Longhena]], a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola.  It appeared also in Turin, notably in the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]  (1668\u20131694) by [[Guarino Guarini]]. The style also began to be used in palaces;  Guarini designed the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in Turin, while Longhena designed the [[Ca' Rezzonico]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], (1657), finished by [[Giorgio Massari]] with decorated with paintings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].<ref>Cabanne (1988), pages 18\u201319.</ref>  A series of massive earthquakes in [[Sicily]] required the rebuilding of most of the, and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.\n\n===Spanish Baroque architecture===\n{{Main|Spanish Baroque architecture}}\n[[File:Bas\u00edlica de Santiago 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The towers of the Cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]] by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]] (1680 (center tower) and 1738\u201350)]]\n[[File:Palacio San Telmo facade Seville Spain.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Palace of San Telmo]], [[Seville]] (1682)]]\nThe Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque Architecture.  The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in [[Madrid]], begun in 1643 by [[Pedro de la Torre]].  It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery.<ref>Cabanne (1988) page 48-49</ref>  The Cathedral in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the ''Obradorio'', added between 1738 and 1750 by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]],  Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] in [[Seville]] by [[Leonardo de Figueroa]].<ref name=\"Cabanne pages 48-51\">Cabanne (1988) pgs. 48\u201351</ref>\n\n[[Granada]] had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century,  and had its own distinct variety of Baroque.  The painter, sculptor and architect [[Alonso Cano]] designed the Baroque interior of [[Granada Cathedral]] between 1652 and his death in 1657.  It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.\n\nSome of the most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the period was designed by the brothers [[Churriguera]], who worked primarily in [[Salamanca]] and [[Madrid]]. The [[Church of San Esteban (Salamanca)|Church of San Esteban]] in Salamanca (1693) is one of the most ornate baroque churches anywhere. Their other works include the buildings on the city's main square, the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]] (1729).<ref name=\"Cabanne pages 48-51\"/>\n\nOther notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include [[Pedro de Ribera]], a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]], who designed the celebrated [[El Transparente]] altarpiece at [[Toledo Cathedral]] (1729\u201332) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.<ref name=\"Cabanne pages 48-51\"/>\n\nThe architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain;  their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in [[Tepotzotl\u00e1n]], with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.<ref>Cabanne (1988) pg. 63</ref>\n\n===Central Europe and ''Rococo'' (1740s\u20131770s)===\n{{Main|Rococo}}\n[[File:Chram sv Mikulase interier oltar od vchodu.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9| [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)]] Prague (1704\u20131755)]]\n[[File:Austria - Vienna (28492836465).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Karlskirche]], Vienna, by [[Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach]] (1732\u20131737)]]\n[[File:Wies altar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Wiesekirche in Bavaria by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745\u20131754)]]\nFrom 1680 to 1750,  many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in central Europe, in Bavaria, Austria, and what is now the Czech Republic.  Some were in [[Rococo]] style,  a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged out of the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''La Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (2014), page 92</ref> \n\nThe princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.<ref>Cabanne (1988), pp. 89\u201394.</ref>  Notable architects included Johann Fischer von Erlach, [[Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] in Bavaria, [[Balthasar Neumann]] in [[Br\u00fchl (Rhineland)|Bruhl]], and [[Matth\u00e4us Daniel P\u00f6ppelmann]] in Dresden. In Prussia, [[Frederic II of Prussia]] was inspired the [[Grand Trianon]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], and used it as the model for his summer residence, [[Sanssouci]], in [[Potsdam]], designed for him by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] (1745\u20131747). Another work of baroque palace architecture is the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Potsdam]], the former orangerie of the palace of the Dukes of [[Saxony]] in the 18th century.\n\nOne of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]], a pilgrimage church located near the town of [[Bad Staffelstein]] near Bamberg, in [[Bavaria]], southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]] and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact center of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.<ref>Ducher (1988) pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nAnother notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies ({{lang-de|Wieskirche}}). It was designed by the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|J. B.]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]], in the municipality of [[Steingaden]] in the [[Weilheim-Schongau]] district, [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the [[Wessobrunner School]]. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nAnother notable example is the [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)]] in Prague (1704\u201355), built by [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]]. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels,  Light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of colored stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration.  The architecture is transformed into a theater of light, color and movement.<ref name=\"Ducher pages 106-107\"/>\n\n===French Baroque or ''Classicism''===\n{{main|French Baroque architecture}}\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Balleroy 25.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chateau de Balleroy]] by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]] (1626\u20131636)]]\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles 04 2016 5737.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Versailles]] (begun by [[Louis Le Vau]] in 1661)]]\nFrance largely resisted the ornate baroque style of Italy, Spain, Vienna and the rest of Europe. The French Baroque style (often termed ''Grand Classicism'' or simply ''Classicism''  in France) is closely associated with the works built for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV]]; it features more geometric order and measure than baroque, and less elaborate decoration on the facades and in the interiors.  Louis XIV invited the master of baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Louis Le Vau]].<ref>Cabanne (1988) pages 25\u201332.</ref>\n\nThe principal architects of the style included [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]] ([[Chateau de Balleroy]], 1626\u20131636), [[Pierre Le Muet]] (Church of [[Val-de-Grace]], 1645\u20131665), [[Louis Le Vau]] ([[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], 1657\u20131661) and especially [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Robert de Cotte]], whose work included the [[Galerie des Glaces]] and the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles (1687\u20131688). Mansart was also responsible for the Baroque-classicism of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] (1686\u20131699).<ref>Cabanne (1988), pgs. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\nThe major work of the period was the [[Palace of Versailles]], begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter [[Charles Le Brun]]. The gardens were designed by [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]] specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the ch\u00e2teau, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate [[Petit Trianon]] and the highly ornate theater. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly [[Peter the Great]] of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at [[Peterhof Palace]] near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.<ref>Cabanne (1988), pgs. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\n===Russian Baroque===\n[[File:Catherine Palace in Tsarskoe Selo 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Catherine Palace]] by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] (1752-)]]\n[[File:The Great Church of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, iconostasis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Great Church of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg, by Rastrelli (1753\u20131759)]]\nThe debut of Russian Baroque, or [[Petrine Baroque]], followed a long visit of [[Peter the Great]] to western Europe in 1697\u201398,  where he visited the Chateaux of Fontainebleu and Versailles and other architectural monuments.  He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, when he moved the Russian capital there in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine baroque include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].\nDuring the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; called [[Elizabethan Baroque]]. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].<ref>* William Craft Brumfield.

In their palette, they used intense and warm colors, and particularly made use of the [[primary colors]] of painting at the time, red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity.<ref>Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 11</ref>   In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures.  In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.  Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions.  They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the center of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical or horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement.  They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama.<ref>Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pgs. 3\u201315</ref>  Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.<ref>Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 12</ref> \n\n[[File:The Toilet of Venus, by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1755)]]\nThe earliest Baroque painters were the Italians the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci| Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio's realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.    Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Andrea Pozzo]], and [[Paolo de Matteis]] in Italy; [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]] in Spain; [[Adam Elsheimer]] in Germany; and [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Georges de La Tour]] in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy).  Poussin and La Tour adopted a \"classical\" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than colour.  \n\n[[Peter Paul Rubens]] was the most important painter of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] style.  Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.\n\nOne important domain of Baroque painting was ''Quadratura'', or paintings in ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'', which literally \"fooled the eye\".  These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels saints, and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''La Caract\u00e9istique des Styles'' (2014), pg. 92 </ref>  \n\nIn Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; [[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]] (1633\u201339), to glorify the reign of [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Pietro da Cortona\u2019s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. .<ref>Ducher (1988) pages 108\u2013109</ref>\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period.  He designed tapestries, carpets and theater decoration as well as painting.  His work was extremely popular with [[Madame Pompadour]], the Mistress of King [[Louis XV]]. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.<ref>Cabanne (1988) pp. 102\u2013104</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n{{Main|Baroque sculpture}}\n[[File:Teresabernini.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''Ecstasy of St. Teresa'', by [[Bernini]] (1647\u20131652)]]\n[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Bust of [[Louis XIV]] by Bernini, Versailles (1665)]]\nThe dominant figure in baroque sculpture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  Under the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]], he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican, including the imposing [[Chair of St. Peter]] beneath the dome in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]  In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.<ref>Boucher, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'' (1999), p. 146</ref>\n\nBaroque sculpture was particularly inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous statue of [[Laoco\u00f6n]] from the First Century A.D., which was on display in the gallery of the Vatican.  When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the Academy of painting and sculpture, he advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature.  He told the students, \"When I had trouble with my first statue, i consulted the ''Antinous'' like an oracle.\"<ref>Boucher (1999) page 16.</ref>\n\nNotable late French baroque sculptors included [[\u00c9tienne Maurice Falconet]] and [[Jean Baptiste Pigalle]].  Pigalle was commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to make statues for Frederick's own version of Versailles at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback found in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn Spain, the sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Rosary Chapel of the Church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca, Mexico (1724\u201331).\n\n==Music and ballet==\n{{Main article|Baroque music|Baroque dance}}\n[[File:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Louis XIV in costume for the ''Ballet Royal de la Nuit'' (1653)]]\n[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], (1678\u20131741)]]\nThe term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term 'baroque' for music were criticisms.  In an anonymous, satirical review of the premi\u00e8re in October 1733 of Rameau's ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was \"du barocque,\" complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous ''Encylopedi\u00e9'' of [[Denis Diderot]]:   \"Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedie\"/>\n\nCommon use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans-title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=German|pages=7\u201315 }}</ref> and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}\n\nThe baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation. New forms were invented, including the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. [[Opera]] was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly lost ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe:   Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music,  In 1669, the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theater in France open to the public, and premiered ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'', the first grand opera in French, with music by [[Robert Cambert]], with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet.<ref name=\"Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde\">B\u00e9ly, Lucien, ''Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde'' (2005), pp. 152\u201354</ref> [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.\n\nThe classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by [[Marie de Medici]], and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. [[Louis XIV]] himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse]], was founded by the King.  It was the first professional dance school and company,  and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.<ref name=\"Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde\"/>\n\nSeveral new instruments, including the [[piano]], were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655\u20131731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], as the Keeper of the Instruments. .<ref>{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655\u20131731) &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref> Cristofori named the instrument ''un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte'' (\"a keyboard of [[cypress]] with soft and loud\"), abbreviated over time as ''pianoforte'', ''fortepiano'', and later, simply, piano.<ref>Isacoff (2012, 23)</ref>\n\n===Composers and examples===\n* [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] (c. 1554/1557\u20131612) ''[[Sonata pian' e forte]]'' (1597), ''[[In Ecclesiis]]'' (from ''Symphoniae sacrae'' book 2, 1615)\n* [[Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger]] (c.  1580\u20131651) ''[[Libro primo di villanelle, 20]]'' (1610)\n* [[Claudio Monteverdi]] (1567\u20131643), ''[[L'Orfeo|L'Orfeo, favola in musica]]'' (1610)\n* [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672), ''[[Musikalische Exequien]]'' (1629, 1647, 1650)\n* [[Francesco Cavalli]] (1602\u20131676), ''[[Egisto (opera)|L'Egisto]]'' (1643), ''[[Ercole amante]]'' (1662), ''[[Scipione affricano]]'' (1664)\n* [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] (1632\u20131687), ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' (1686)\n* [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] (1643\u20131704), ''[[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]'' (1688\u20131698)\n* [[Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber]] (1644\u20131704), ''[[Mystery Sonatas]]'' (1681)\n* [[John Blow]] (1649\u20131708), ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1680\u20131687)\n* [[Johann Pachelbel]] (1653\u20131706), ''[[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D]]'' (1680)\n* [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713), [[Twelve concerti grossi, op.6 (Corelli)|12 concerti grossi, Op. 6]] (1714)\n* [[Marin Marais]] (1656\u20131728), ''[[Sonnerie de Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve du Mont-de-Paris]]'' (1723)\n* [[Henry Purcell]] (1659\u20131695), ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1688)\n* [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1660\u20131725), ''[[L'honest\u00e0 negli amori]]'' (1680), ''[[Il Pompeo]]'' (1683), ''[[Mitridate Eupatore]]'' (1707)\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] (1668\u20131733), ''[[Les barricades myst\u00e9rieuses]]'' (1717)\n* [[Tomaso Albinoni]] (1671\u20131751), ''[[Didone abbandonata (Albinoni)|Didone abbandonata]]'' (1724)\n* [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741), ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1725)\n* [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]] (1679\u20131745), ''[[Il Serpente di Bronzo]]'' (1730), ''[[Missa Sanctissimae Trinitatis]]'' (1736)\n* [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (1681\u20131767), ''[[Der Tag des Gerichts]]'' (1762)\n* [[Johann David Heinichen]] (1683\u20131729)\n* [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] (1683\u20131764), ''[[Dardanus (opera)|Dardanus]]'' (1739)\n* [[George Frideric Handel]] (1685\u20131759), ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'' (1717), ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1741)\n* [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (1685\u20131757), [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|Sonatas for harpsichord]]\n* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750), [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D minor]] (1703\u20131707), ''[[Brandenburg Concertos]]'' (1721), ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' (1727)\n* [[Nicola Porpora]] (1686\u20131768), ''[[Semiramide riconosciuta (Porpora)|Semiramide riconosciuta]]'' (1729)\n* [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]] (1710\u20131736), ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' (1736)\n\n==Theatre==\n[[File:Set design Act5 of Androm\u00e8de by P Corneille 1650 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Set design for ''Andromed\u00e9'' by [[Pierre Corneille]], (1650)]]\n\nThe Baroque period was a golden age for theater in France and Spain;  playwrights included [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Moliere]] in France; and [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] Spain.\n\nDuring the Baroque period, the art and style of the theater evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet.

He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three [[Aristotle]] unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.<ref>Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.&nbsp;446\u2013447</ref> Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.<ref>Amadei-Pulice, 1990, Mar\u00eda Alicia (1990).

John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6</ref>\n\nTirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calder\u00f3n were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calder\u00f3n. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, ''The Convicted Suspicions'' and ''[[The Trickster of Seville]]'', one of the first versions of the [[Don Juan]] myth.<ref>Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992).

His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called \"Fiestas\" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called \"Naumaquias\". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of [[Buen Retiro]], of [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] and of [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.<ref>Amadei-Pulice, 1990, Mar\u00eda Alicia (1990).

John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327</ref> Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calder\u00f3n's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calder\u00f3n's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calder\u00f3n's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of [[Autos sacramentales]] achieved high ranks.<ref>Molina Jim\u00e9nez,  Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n (2008).

There was also [[Johannes Velten]] who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the [[commedia del'arte]]  with the classic theatre of Corneille and [[Moli\u00e8re]]. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.\n\n==End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery==\nMadame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, probably without intending it, contributed to the decline of the baroque and rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson|Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandi\u00e9res became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named Royal Director of buildings in 1754. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting of architecture. {{sfn|Cabanne|1988|pg. 106}} \n\nThe pioneer German art historian and archeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture.  By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism.  The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: \"Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pierre de Cortone in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists.\"<ref>Boucher, Bruce, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'', Thames and Hudson, (1997), page 9</ref>    In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic [[John Ruskin]] declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.<ref>Boucher (1998) page 9.</ref>\n\nThe Swiss-born art historian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin (1864\u20131945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his Renaissance und Barock (1888); W\u00f6lfflin identified the Baroque as \"movement imported into mass\", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favor.  The term \"Baroque\" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.\n\n==Italian Baroque==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Church of the Ges\u00f9, Rome.jpg|Facade of the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]], Rome (1584)\nFile:Lazio Roma SIgnazio tango7174.jpg|[[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Saint Ignatius, Rome]] (1626\u20131650)\nFile:Dome of Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Rome).jpg|Ceiling of the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9]], Rome (1674\u20131679)\nFile:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice).jpg|The [[Ca Rezzonico]], Venice (1649\u20131656)\nFile:Cortile Spada 01.jpg|Cartouches decorating courtyard of the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome by [[Borromini]] (1632)\nFile:Forced perspective gallery by Francesco Borromini.jpg|Gallery with forced perspective by [[Francesco Borromini]], creates the illusion that the corridor is much longer than it really is.

This type of [[algebraic structure]] captures essential properties of both [[Set (mathematics)|set]] operations and [[logic]] operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a [[power set]] algebra or a [[field of sets]], or its elements can be viewed as generalized [[truth value]]s. It is also a special case of a [[De Morgan algebra]] and a [[Kleene algebra (with involution)]].\n\nEvery Boolean algebra [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|gives rise]] to a [[Boolean ring]], and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] \u2227, and ring addition to [[exclusive or|exclusive disjunction]] or [[symmetric difference]] (not [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] \u2228). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the [[Duality principle (Boolean algebra)|duality principle]].<ref>Givant and [[Paul Halmos]], 2009, p.&nbsp;20</ref>\n[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|250px|Boolean lattice of subsets]]\n__TOC__\n\n== History ==  <!-- [[Boolean algebra (history)]] redirects here -->\n\nThe term \"Boolean algebra\" honors [[George Boole]] (1815\u20131864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the [[algebraic system]] initially in a small pamphlet, ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic'', published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], and later as a more substantial book, ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'', published in 1854. Boole's formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by [[William Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and [[distributive lattice]]s is owed to the 1890 ''Vorlesungen'' of [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der]]. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra''. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by [[Edward V. Huntington]]. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of [[Marshall Stone]] in the 1930s, and with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s 1940 ''Lattice Theory''. In the 1960s, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], [[Dana Scott]], and others found deep new results in [[mathematical logic]] and [[axiomatic set theory]] using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] and [[Boolean-valued model]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA '''Boolean algebra''' is a six-[[tuple]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'', equipped with two [[binary operation]]s \u2227 (called \"meet\" or \"and\"), \u2228 (called \"join\" or \"or\"), a [[unary operation]] \u00ac (called \"complement\" or \"not\") and two elements 0 and 1 (called \"bottom\" and \"top\", or \"least\" and \"greatest\" element, also denoted by the symbols \u22a5 and \u22a4, respectively), such that for all elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of ''A'', the following [[axiom]]s hold:<ref>Davey, Priestley, 1990, p.109, 131, 144</ref>\n\n::{| cellpadding=5\n|''a'' \u2228 (''b'' \u2228 ''c'') = (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') \u2228 ''c''\n|''a'' \u2227 (''b'' \u2227 ''c'') = (''a'' \u2227 ''b'') \u2227 ''c''\n| [[associativity]]\n|-\n|''a'' \u2228 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2228 ''a''\n|''a'' \u2227 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2227 ''a''\n| [[commutativity]]\n|-\n|''a'' \u2228 (''a'' \u2227 ''b'') = ''a''\n|''a'' \u2227 (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') = ''a''\n| [[Absorption law|absorption]]\n|-\n|''a'' \u2228 0 = ''a''\n|''a'' \u2227 1 = ''a''\n| [[identity element|identity]]\n|-\n|''a'' \u2228 (''b'' \u2227 ''c'') = (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') \u2227 (''a'' \u2228 ''c'')&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|''a'' \u2227 (''b'' \u2228 ''c'') = (''a'' \u2227 ''b'') \u2228 (''a'' \u2227 ''c'')&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| [[distributivity]]\n|-\n|''a'' \u2228 \u00ac''a'' = 1\n|''a'' \u2227 \u00ac''a'' = 0\n| [[complemented lattice|complements]]\n|}\nNote, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms (see [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Axiomatics|Proven properties]]).\n\nA Boolean algebra with only one element is called a '''trivial Boolean algebra''' or a '''degenerate Boolean algebra'''. (Some authors require 0 and 1 to be ''distinct'' elements in order to exclude this case.)\n\nIt follows from the last three pairs of axioms above (identity, distributivity and complements), or from the absorption axiom, that\n::''a'' = ''b'' \u2227 ''a'' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if and only if &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''a'' \u2228 ''b'' = ''b''.\nThe relation \u2264 defined by ''a'' \u2264 ''b'' if these equivalent conditions hold, is a [[partial order]] with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet ''a'' \u2227 ''b'' and the join ''a'' \u2228 ''b'' of two elements coincide with their [[infimum]] and [[supremum]], respectively, with respect to \u2264.\n\nThe first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a [[bounded lattice]].\n\nIt follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.\n\nThe set of axioms is [[duality (order theory)|self-dual]] in the sense that if one exchanges \u2228 with \u2227 and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its '''dual'''.<ref>{{citation|title=Boolean Algebra|first=R.

Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].\n\n:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in [[electrical engineering]]<ref>Strictly, electrical engineers tend to use additional states to represent other circuit conditions such as high impedance - see [[IEEE 1164]] or [[IEEE 1364]].</ref>; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one [[bit]] in a [[digital circuit]], typically high and low [[voltage]]. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.\n\n:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial [[brute force search|brute force]] algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (''Consensus theorems'') are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:\n:** (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') \u2227 (\u00ac''a'' \u2228 ''c'') \u2227 (''b'' \u2228 ''c'') \u2261 (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') \u2227 (\u00ac''a'' \u2228 ''c'')\n:** (''a'' \u2227 ''b'') \u2228 (\u00ac''a'' \u2227 ''c'') \u2228 (''b'' \u2227 ''c'') \u2261 (''a'' \u2227 ''b'') \u2228 (\u00ac''a'' \u2227 ''c'')\n\n* The [[power set]] (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set ''S'' forms a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]], with the two operations \u2228 := \u222a (union) and \u2227 := \u2229 (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the [[empty set]] and the largest element 1 is the set ''S'' itself.\n\n:* After the two-element Boolean algebra, the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the [[power set]] of two atoms:\n{|\n|-\n| width=\"70\" |\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! \u2227 || 0 || a || b || 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n! a\n| 0 || a || 0 || a\n|-\n! b\n| 0 || 0 || b || b\n|-\n! 1\n| 0 || a || b || 1\n|}\n|\n| width=\"30\" |\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! \u2228 || 0 || a || b || 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0 || a || b || 1\n|-\n! a\n| a || a || 1 || 1\n|-\n! b\n| b || 1 || b || 1\n|-\n! 1\n| 1 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|}\n|\n| width=\"40\" |\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! ''x'' || 0 || a || b || 1\n|-\n! \u00ac''x''\n| 1 || b || a || 0\n|}\n|}\n\n* The set of all subsets of ''S'' that are either finite or [[cofinite]] is a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]].\n* Starting with the [[propositional calculus]] with \u03ba sentence symbols, form the [[Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra]] (that is, the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo [[logical equivalence]]).  This construction yields a Boolean algebra.  It is in fact the [[free Boolean algebra]] on \u03ba generators.  A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.\n* Given any [[linearly ordered]] set ''L'' with a least element, the interval algebra is the smallest algebra of subsets of ''L'' containing all of the half-open intervals [''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is in ''L'' and ''b'' is either in ''L'' or equal to \u221e.  Interval algebras are useful in the study of [[Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra]]s; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.\n\n[[File:Lattice T 30.svg|thumb|x150px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the Boolean algebra of divisors of 30.]]\n* For any [[natural number]] ''n'', the set of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'', defining ''a''\u2264''b'' if ''a'' [[divides]] ''b'', forms a [[distributive lattice]]. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is [[square-free integer|square-free]]. The bottom and the top element of this Boolean algebra is the natural number 1 and ''n'', respectively. The complement of ''a'' is given by ''n''/''a''. The meet and the join of ''a'' and ''b'' is given by the [[greatest common divisor]] (gcd) and the [[least common multiple]] (lcm) of ''a'' and ''b'', respectively. The ring addition ''a''+''b'' is given by lcm(''a'',''b'')/gcd(''a'',''b''). The picture shows an example for ''n'' = 30. As a counter-example, considering the non-square-free ''n''=60, the greatest common divisor of 30 and its complement 2 would be 2, while it should be the bottom element 1.\n* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from [[topology|topological spaces]]: if ''X'' is a topological space, then the collection of all subsets of ''X'' which are [[Clopen set|both open and closed]] forms a Boolean algebra with the operations \u2228 := \u222a (union) and \u2227 := \u2229 (intersection).\n* If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[mathematical ring|ring]] and we define the set of ''central idempotents'' by <br> ''A'' = { ''e'' \u2208 ''R'' : ''e''<sup>2</sup> = ''e'', ''ex'' = ''xe'', \u2200''x'' \u2208 ''R'' } <br> then the set ''A'' becomes a Boolean algebra with the operations ''e'' \u2228 ''f'' := ''e'' + ''f'' - ''ef'' and ''e'' \u2227 ''f'' := ''ef''.\n\n== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==\n<!-- \"Boolean homomorphism\" redirects here -->\n\nA ''[[homomorphism]]'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'' such that for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'':\n\n: ''f''(''a'' \u2228 ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') \u2228 ''f''(''b''),\n: ''f''(''a'' \u2227 ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') \u2227 ''f''(''b''),\n: ''f''(0) = 0,\n: ''f''(1) = 1.\n\nIt then follows that ''f''(\u00ac''a'') = \u00ac''f''(''a'') for all ''a'' in ''A''. The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a [[full subcategory]] of the [[category theory|category]] of lattices.\n<!--The constant function with ''f''(''a'') = 1 for all ''a'' in ''A'' satisfies the first, second, and fourth conditions but not the third (unless ''B'' is the degenerate singleton Boolean algebra with 0 = 1), so it is not a Boolean algebra homomorphism.-->\n\nAn ''isomorphism'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a homomorphism ''f'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'' with an inverse homomorphism, that is, a homomorphism ''g'' : ''B'' \u2192 ''A'' such that the [[function composition|composition]] ''g'' \u25cc ''f'': ''A'' \u2192 ''A'' is the [[identity function]] on ''A'', and the composition ''f'' \u25cc ''g'': ''B'' \u2192 ''B'' is the identity function on ''B''.  A homomorphism of Boolean algebras is an isomorphism if and only if it is [[bijection|bijective]].\n\n== Boolean rings ==\n{{Main article|Boolean ring}}\nEvery Boolean algebra (A, \u2227, \u2228) gives rise to a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] (''A'', +, \u00b7) by defining ''a'' + ''b'' := (''a'' \u2227 \u00ac''b'') \u2228 (''b'' \u2227 \u00ac''a'') = (''a'' \u2228 ''b'') \u2227 \u00ac(''a'' \u2227 ''b'') (this operation is called [[symmetric difference]] in the case of sets and [[Truth table#Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] in the case of logic) and ''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' := ''a'' \u2227 ''b''. The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the 1 of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that ''a'' \u00b7 ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''; rings with this property are called [[Boolean ring]]s.\n\nConversely, if a Boolean ring ''A'' is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining ''x'' \u2228 ''y'' := ''x'' + ''y'' + (''x'' \u00b7 ''y'') and ''x'' \u2227 ''y'' := ''x'' \u00b7 ''y''.\n<ref>Stone, 1936</ref><ref>Hsiang, 1985, p.260</ref>\nSince these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map ''f'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'' is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The [[category theory|categories]] of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cohn|2003}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VESm0MJOiDQC&pg=PA81 p.&nbsp;81].</ref>\n\nHsiang (1985) gave a [[Abstract rewriting system|rule-based algorithm]] to [[Word problem (mathematics)|check]] whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.\n<!---probably too much details(?):---\nHsiang (1985) gave a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] and [[Abstract_rewriting_system#Termination_and_convergence|terminating]] [[Abstract rewriting system|rewrite system]] for Boolean rings, thus solving their [[Word problem (mathematics)|word problem]]: to check whether two arbitrary expressions ''s'' and ''t'' denote the same value in every Boolean ring, apply rewrite rules to ''s'' as long as possible, resulting in an expression ''s''<sub>n</sub>, obtain ''t''<sub>n</sub> from ''t'' in a similar way, and check whether ''s''<sub>n</sub> and ''t''<sub>n</sub> are literally identical, except for different parenthezation and order of operands of \"+\" or \"\u00b7\".\n--->\nMore generally, Boudet, [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud|Jouannaud]], and Schmidt-Schau\u00df (1989) gave an algorithm to [[Unification (computer science)#Particular background knowledge sets E|solve equations]] between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.\nEmploying the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in [[automated theorem proving]].\n\n== Ideals and filters ==\n{{Main article|Ideal (order theory)|Filter (mathematics)}}\nAn ''ideal'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''I'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' we have x \u2228 y in ''I'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' \u2227 ''x'' in ''I''. This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of [[ring ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''prime'' if ''I'' \u2260 ''A'' and if ''a'' \u2227 ''b'' in ''I'' always implies ''a'' in ''I'' or ''b'' in ''I''. Furthermore, for every ''a'' \u2208 ''A'' we have that ''a'' \u2227 ''-a'' = 0 \u2208 ''I'' and then ''a'' \u2208 ''I'' or ''-a'' \u2208 ''I'' for every ''a'' \u2208 ''A'', if ''I'' is prime. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''maximal'' if ''I'' \u2260 ''A'' and if the only ideal properly containing ''I'' is ''A'' itself. For an ideal ''I'', if ''a'' \u2209 ''I'' and ''-a'' \u2209 ''I'', then ''I'' \u222a {''a''} or ''I'' \u222a {''-a''} is properly contained in another ideal ''J''. Hence, that an ''I'' is not maximal and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras. Moreover, these notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of [[prime ideal]] and [[maximal ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''.\n\nThe dual of an ''ideal'' is a ''filter''. A ''filter'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''p'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''p'' we have ''x'' \u2227 ''y'' in ''p'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' \u2228 ''x'' in ''p''. The dual of a ''maximal'' (or ''prime'') ''ideal'' in a Boolean algebra is ''[[ultrafilter]]''. Ultrafilters can alternatively be described as [[2-valued morphism]]s from ''A'' to the two-element Boolean algebra. The statement ''every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter'' is called the ''[[Boolean prime ideal theorem#The ultrafilter lemma|Ultrafilter Theorem]]'' and can not be proved in [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZF]], if [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] is [[consistent]]. Within ZF, it is strictly weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].\nThe Ultrafilter Theorem has many equivalent formulations: ''every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter'', ''every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal'', etc.\n\n== Representations ==\n\nIt can be shown that every ''finite'' Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set.  Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a [[power of two]].\n\n[[Marshall H. Stone|Stone's]] celebrated ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'' states that ''every'' Boolean algebra ''A'' is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all [[clopen set|clopen]] sets in some ([[compact space|compact]] [[totally disconnected]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) topological space.\n\n== Axiomatics ==\n\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | '''Proven properties'''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| align=\"left\" class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

Huntington]] (1874\u20131952) gave probably the most parsimonious axiomatization based on \u2227, \u2228, \u00ac, even proving the associativity laws (see box).<ref>Huntington, 1904, p.292-293, (first of several axiomatizations by Huntington)</ref>\nHe also proved that these axioms are [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of each other.<ref>Huntington, 1904, p.296</ref>\nIn 1933, Huntington set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra.  It requires just one binary operation + and a [[unary functional symbol]] ''n'', to be read as 'complement', which satisfy the following laws:\n\n# ''Commutativity'': ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x''.\n# ''Associativity'': (''x'' + ''y'') + ''z'' = ''x'' + (''y'' + ''z'').\n# ''Huntington equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''y'') + ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''n''(''y'')) = ''x''.\n\n[[Herbert Robbins]] immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:\n\n:4. ''Robbins Equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'' + ''y'') + ''n''(''x'' + ''n''(''y''))) = ''x'',\n\ndo (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a ''Robbins algebra'', the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the [[Robbins conjecture]]) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students. In 1996, [[William McCune]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins's question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune's proof was the [[automated reasoning program]] [[EQP]] he designed. For a simplification of McCune's proof, see Dahn (1998).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| {{Algebraic structures|Lattice}}\n|}\nRemoving the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields \"generalized Boolean algebras\". Formally, a [[distributive lattice]] ''B'' is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element 0 and for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in ''B'' such that ''a'' \u2264 ''b'', there exists an element ''x'' such that a \u2227 x = 0 and a \u2228 x = b. Defining a \u2216 b as the unique ''x'' such that (a \u2227 b) \u2228 x = a and (a \u2227 b) \u2227 x = 0, we say that the structure (B,\u2227,\u2228,\u2216,0) is a ''generalized Boolean algebra'', while (B,\u2228,0) is a ''generalized Boolean [[semilattice]]''. Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideals]] of Boolean lattices.\n\nA structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an [[orthocomplemented lattice]]. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in [[quantum logic]] as lattices of closed subspaces for separable [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[Boolean domain]]\n* [[Boolean function]]\n* [[Boolean logic]]\n* [[Boolean ring]]\n* [[Boolean-valued function]]\n* [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)]]\n* [[Complete Boolean algebra]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[De Morgan's laws]]\n* [[Finitary boolean function]]\n* [[Forcing (mathematics)]]\n* [[Free Boolean algebra]]\n* [[Heyting algebra]]\n* [[Hypercube graph]]\n* [[Karnaugh map]]\n* [[Laws of Form]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Logic gate]]\n* [[Logical graph]]\n* [[Logical matrix]]\n* [[Propositional logic]]\n* [[Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm]]\n* [[Two-element Boolean algebra]]\n* [[Venn diagram]]\n* [[Conditional event algebra]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Brown\n | first1 = Stephen\n | last2 = Vranesic\n | first2 = Zvonko\n | year = 2002\n | title = Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design\n | edition = 2nd\n | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill|McGraw\u2013Hill]]\n | isbn = 978-0-07-249938-4}}.

It is located in [[Palazzo Koch]], [[via Nazionale (Rome)|via Nazionale]], [[Rome]]. The bank's current governor is [[Ignazio Visco]], who took the office on 1 November 2011.\n\n==Functions==\nAfter the charge of monetary and exchange rate policies was shifted in 1998 to the [[European Central Bank]], within the European institutional framework, the bank implements the decisions, issues [[euro]] banknotes and withdraws and destroys worn pieces.\n\nThe main function has thus become banking and financial supervision. The objective is to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system and compliance to rules and regulations; the bank pursues it through secondary legislation, controls and cooperation with governmental authorities.\n\nFollowing reform in 2005, which was prompted by takeover scandals, the bank has lost exclusive antitrust authority in the credit sector, which is now shared with the [[Italian Competition Authority]] ({{lang-it|Autorit\u00e0 Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato}}).\n\nOther functions include, market supervision, oversight of the payment system and provision of settlement services, State treasury service, Central Credit Register, economic analysis and institutional consultancy.\n\nAs of 2017 the Bank of Italy owned 2,451.8 [[tonnes]] of [[gold]], the third-largest [[Gold reserve|gold reserve]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gold.org/research/latest-world-official-gold-reserves|title=Latest Gold Holdings - XLSX Download - World Gold Council|website=www.gold.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe institution was established in 1893 from the combination of three major banks in Italy (after the [[Banca Romana scandal]]).<ref name=quaderni>Alfredo Gigliobianco and Claire Giordano, [https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/quaderni-storia/2010-0005/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1 \"Economic Theory and Banking Regulation: The Italian Case (1861-1930s)\"], ''Quaderni di Storia Economica'' (''Economic History Working Papers''), No. 5, November 2010</ref><ref> [https://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/storia/origini/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1 \"Banca D'Italia: Origins\"], Banca D'Italia.</ref> The new central bank first issued bank-notes during 1926.<ref>[https://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/storia/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1 \"Banca D'Italia: History\"], Banca D'Italia.</ref> Until 1928, it was directed by a general manager, after this time instead by a governor elected by an internal commission of managers, with a decree from the [[President of the Italian Republic]], for a term of seven years.\n\n===General Managers (1893\u20131928)===\n*[[Giacomo Grillo (banker)|Giacomo Grillo]] (1893\u20131894)\n*[[Giuseppe Marchiori]] (1894\u20131900)\n*[[Bonaldo Stringher]] (1900\u20131928)\n\n===Governors (1928\u2013present)===\n*[[Bonaldo Stringher]] (1928\u20131930)\n*[[Vincenzo Azzolini]] (1931\u20131944)\n*[[Luigi Einaudi]] (1945\u20131948)\n*[[Donato Menichella]] (1948\u20131960)\n*[[Guido Carli]] (1960\u20131975)\n*[[Paolo Baffi]] (1975\u20131979)\n*[[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1979\u20131993)\n*[[Antonio Fazio]] (1993\u20132005)\n*[[Mario Draghi]] (2005\u20132011)\n*[[Ignazio Visco]] (2011\u2013present)\n\n==Organization==\n===Governing bodies===\nThe bank's governing bodies are the [[Annual General Meeting|General Meeting of Shareholders]], the [[board of directors]], the governor, the [[director general]] and three deputy directors general; the last five constitute the directorate. \n\nThe general meeting takes place yearly and with the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the [[auditor]]s. The board of directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the director general in his absence). Following reform in 2005, the governor lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions of external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the directorate (by majority vote). The director general is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and acts as governor when absent.\n\nThe [[board of auditors]] assesses the bank's administration and compliance with the law, regulations and the statute.\n\n===Appointment===\nThe directorate's [[term of office]] lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is the responsibility of the government, head of the board of directors, with the approval of the [[President of Italy|president]] (formally a [[decree]] of the president). The board of directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank [[statute]].\n\nOn 25 October 2011, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] nominated [[Ignazio Visco]] to be the bank's new governor to replace [[Mario Draghi]] when he left to become president of the [[European Central Bank]] in November.<ref name=\"viscohead\">{{cite news|title=Berlusconi names Visco to head Bank of Italy in surprise move|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-cenbank/update-2-berlusconi-names-visco-to-head-bank-of-italy-in-surprise-move-idUSL5E7LK5TZ20111020|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Reuters|date=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Shareholders==\nBanca d'Italia had 300,000 shares with a nominal value of \u20ac25,000.

"text": "'''Beachcomber''' is a ''[[pen name|nom de plume]]'' that has been used by several journalists writing a long-running humorous column on the ''[[Daily Express]]''. It was originated in 1919 by [[John Bernard Arbuthnot|Major John Bernard Arbuthnot]] MVO as his signature on the column, titled \u2018By the Way\u2019. The name Beachcomber was then passed to [[D. B. Wyndham Lewis]] and, in turn, to [[J.B. Morton]], who wrote the column till 1975. It was later revived by [[William Hartston]], current author of the column.\n\n==\"By the Way\" column==\n\"By the Way\" was originally a column in ''[[The Globe (London)|The Globe]]'', consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; [[P. G. Wodehouse]] was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by  [[Herbert Westbrook]].<ref>''P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master'', David A. Jasen, Music Sales Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8256-7275-9}}</ref> After the ''Globe'''s closure, it was reestablished as a society news column in the ''Daily Express'' from 1917 onwards, initially written by social correspondent [[John Bernard Arbuthnot|Major John Arbuthnot]], who invented the name \"Beachcomber\".\n\nAfter Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over sometime in 1919 by Wyndham-Lewis, who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 <ref>{{cite news|title=Beachcomber lives again|date=5 January 1996|work=Daily Express|page=2}}</ref> and continues today, written by [[William Hartston]]. The column is unsigned except by \"Beachcomber\" and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by [[Spike Milligan]] amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.\n\nThe format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:\n\n* court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarfs before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot.\n* angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders.\n* interruptions from \"Prodnose\", representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out.\n* installments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning.\n* parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely \"literary\" type such as [[Ibsen]].\n* unlikely headlines, such as \"SIXTY HORSES WEDGED IN A CHIMNEY\", for which the copy in its entirety was \"The story to fit this sensational headline has not turned up yet.\"\n* news reports from around the country.\n* or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.\n\nMorton's other interest, [[France]], was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.\n\n\"By the Way\" was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste.  Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the ''Express'' newspaper's owner, [[Lord Beaverbrook]], who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was [[George Orwell]], who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as \"A Catholic Apologist\" and accused him of being \"silly-clever\", in line with his criticisms of [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Ronald Knox]] and Wyndham-Lewis. \n\nBut ''By the Way'' was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced ''Daily Express'' throughout [[World War II]], when Morton's lampooning of [[Hitler]], including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.\n\nThe column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled \"Beachcomber\", not \"By the Way\".\n\n==Recurrent characters==\n\n*Mr. Justice Cocklecarrot: well-meaning but ineffectual [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]], plagued by litigation involving the '''twelve red-bearded dwarfs'''. Often appears in [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]].\n*Mrs. Justice Cocklecarrot: his wife.  Very silent, until she observes that \"Wivens has fallen down a manhole\". An enquiry from the judge as to which Wivens that would be elicits the response \"E. D. Wivens\". After a worrying interval she reveals that E. D. Wivens is a cat. His Lordship observes that [[cat]]s do not have initials. \"This one does\", says she.\n*Tinklebury Snapdriver and Honeygander Gooseboote: two [[Barrister|counsel]].  The elbow of one has a mysterious tendency to become jammed in the jaws of the other. Honeyweather Gooseboote, surely?\n*Twelve red-bearded dwarfs, with a penchant for farcical [[litigation]]. Their names \"appear to be\" Scorpion de Rooftrouser, Cleveland Zackhouse, Frums Gillygottle, Edeledel Edel, Churm Rincewind, Sophus Barkayo-Tong, Amaninter Axling, Guttergorm Guttergormpton, Badly Oronparser, Listenis Youghaupt, Molonay Tubilderborst and Farjole Merrybody.  They admit that these are not genuine names.  (Further red-bearded dwarfs, to the number of forty-one, appear in other litigation.)\n*Captain Foulenough: archetypal cad and gatecrasher who impersonates the [[upper class]] in order to wreck their social events.  Educated at '''Narkover''', a school specializing in [[card game|card-playing]], [[horse-racing]] and [[bribery]]. His title of \"Captain\" is probably spurious;<ref>One story attributes it to the fact that he once commanded a canal barge.</ref> but even if it had been a genuine military title, his use of it in civilian life, when at that time only officers who had achieved the rank of Major and above were allowed to do so, gives a subtle hint as to his nature.\n*Mountfalcon Foulenough: his [[prig]]gish nephew, who brings havoc to Narkover and \"makes virtue seem even more horrifying than usual\".\n*[[Ars longa, vita brevis|Vita Brevis]]: debutante frequently plagued by, but with a certain reluctant admiration for, Captain Foulenough.\n*Dr. Smart-Allick: genteel, but ludicrous and [[criminal]], [[headmaster]] of Narkover.\n*Miss Topsy Turvey: neighbouring [[headmistress]], courted by Smart-Allick.\n*Dr. Strabismus (whom God preserve) of [[Utrecht]]: eccentric [[scientist]] and [[inventor]].\n*Lord Shortcake: absent-minded [[Peerage|peer]] obsessed by his enormous collection of [[goldfish]].\n*Mrs. McGurgle: [[Coast|seaside]] [[landlady]].  Fearsomely [[United Kingdom|British]], until she decides to reinvent her house as \"H\u00f4tel McGurgle et de l'Univers\" to attract the [[tourist]]s.<ref>There is some inconsistency about her maiden name.  One [[correspondent]] calls her \"Florrie Palmer as was\", but the [[narrator]] says that she was a Gurricle, from Crabhampton.</ref>\n*Ministry of Bubbleblowing: possible [[ancestor]] of [[Monty Python]]'s [[The Ministry of Silly Walks|Ministry of Silly Walks]].\n*Charlie Suet: disastrous [[British civil service|civil servant]].\n*Mimsie Slopcorner: his on-off girlfriend, an ill-informed and irritating social activist.\n*The Filthistan Trio: Ashura, Kazbulah and Rizamughan, three [[Persian people|Persians]] from \"Thurralibad\", two of whom play see-saw on a plank laid across the third.  They have a series of contretemps with British [[bureaucracy]] and the artistic [[The Establishment|establishment]], in which the trio generally represents the voice of reason.\n*Dingi-Poos: the Tibetan Venus.  She obtains desirable commercial contracts by using her charms to hoodwink visiting British [[diplomacy|envoy]]s, principally Colonel Egham and Duncan Mince.\n*Big White Carstairs: [[John Buchan|Buchanesque]] [[Empire builder]], with a tendency to mislay his [[white tie|dress trousers]].\n*O. Thake: naive, accident-prone [[Old Etonian]] and man-about-town.\n*Lady Cabstanleigh: [[upper class|Society]] [[hospitality|hostess]].\n*Stultitia: her niece, a [[playwright]].\n*Boubou Flaring: glamorous but vacuous actress.\n*Emilia Rustiguzzi: voluminous (both in bulk and in decibels) opera singer.\n*Tumbelova, Serge Trouserin, Chuckusafiva: ballet dancers.\n*Colin Velvette: ballet impresario.\n*\"Thunderbolt\" Footle: handsome, socially celebrated boxer (who can do everything except actually fight)\n*The M'Babwa of M'Gonkawiwi: African chief, who occasions great administrative problems in connection with his invitation to the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].\n*The Clam of Chowdah: oriental potentate\n*Mrs. Wretch: formerly the glamorous circus performer Miss Whackaway, now wife to Colonel Wretch and \"horrible welfare worker\".\n*Roland Milk: insipid poet (possible ancestor of [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'s \"[[E. J. Thribb]]\").\n*Prodnose: humourless, reasonable oaf who interrupts Beachcomber's flights of fancy. (The name is journalistic slang for a sub-editor; the broadcaster [[Danny Baker]] has appropriated it as his [[Twitter]] name.)\n\n==Other media==\nThe [[Will Hay]] film ''[[Boys Will Be Boys (1935 film)|Boys Will Be Boys]]'' (1935) was set at Morton's [[Narkover]] school.\n\nAccording to Spike Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, ''[[The Goon Show]]''.  \n\nIn 1969, Milligan based a BBC television series named ''[[The World of Beachcomber]]'' on the columns. A small selection was issued on a 1971 [[LP (format)|LP]] and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work. This featured [[Richard Ingrams]] as Beachcomber, [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] as Prodnose, [[Patricia Routledge]] and [[John Sessions]]. The compilations prepared by [[Mike Barfield]].  Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books featuring Wyndham-Lewis' work===\n\n*''A London Farrago'' (1922)\n\n===Books featuring Morton's work===\n\n====Original collections====\n\n*''Mr Thake: his life and letters'' (1929)\n*''Mr Thake Again'' (1931)\n*''By the Way'' (1931)\n*''Morton's Folly'' (1933)\n*''The Adventures of Mr Thake'' (1934, republished 2008): identical to ''Mr Thake: his life and letters''\n*''Mr Thake and the Ladies'' (1935)\n*''Stuff and Nonsense'' (1935)\n*''Gallimaufry'' (1936)\n*''Sideways Through Borneo'' (1937)\n*''The Dancing Cabman and other verses'' (1938)\n*''A Diet of Thistles'' (1938)\n*''A Bonfire of Weeds'' (1939)\n*''I Do Not Think So'' (1940)\n*''Fool's Paradise'' (1941)\n*''Captain Foulenough and Company'' (1944)\n*''Here and Now'' (1947)\n*''The Misadventures of Dr Strabismus'' (1949)\n*''The Tibetan Venus'' (1951)\n*''Merry-Go-Round'' (1958)\n\n====Later omnibus editions====\n\n*''The Best of Beachcomber'' (ed.

He co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1982 along with [[Vinod Khosla]], [[Scott McNealy]] and [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], and served as chief scientist at the company until 2003. He played an integral role in the early development of [[BSD UNIX]] while a graduate student at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]],<ref>[https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100148022 ACM author profile page: William Nelson Joy]</ref> and he is the original author of the [[vi]] text editor.  He also wrote the 2000 essay ''[[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us]]'', in which he expressed deep concerns over the development of modern technologies.\n\n==Early career==\nJoy was born in the Detroit suburb of [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]], to William Joy, a school vice-principal and counselor, and Ruth Joy. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Michigan]] and a [[Master of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html|title=UC Berkeley Online Tour: Famous Alumni|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=July 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527100153/http://www.berkeley.edu/tour/students/famous_alumni2.html|archivedate=May 27, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nAs a UC Berkeley graduate student, he worked for Fabry's Computer Systems Research Group [[CSRG]] on the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) version of the [[Unix]] operating system.

Joy had been instructed to plug BBN's stack into Berkeley Unix, but he refused to do so, as he had a low opinion of BBN's TCP/IP. So, Joy wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack. According to [[John Gage]]:\n\n{{quote|''BBN had a big contract to implement TCP/IP, but their stuff didn't work, and grad student Joy's stuff worked.

He argued that intelligent [[robot]]s would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He supports and promotes the idea of abandonment of GNR ([[genetics]], nanotechnology, and [[robotics]]) technologies, instead of going into an [[arms race]] between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against [[Grey goo]] \"bad\" nano-machines). This stance of broad relinquishment was criticized by technologists such as [[technological singularity|technological-singularity]] thinker [[Ray Kurzweil]], who instead advocates fine-grained relinquishment and ethical guidelines.<ref>[http://www.kurzweilai.net/are-we-becoming-an-endangered-species-technology-and-ethics-in-the-twenty-first-century \"Are We Becoming an Endangered Species?

He states in his essay that during the conversation, he became surprised that other serious scientists were considering such possibilities likely, and even more astounded at what he felt was a lack of consideration of the contingencies. After bringing the subject up with a few more acquaintances, he states that he was further alarmed by what he felt was the fact that although many people considered these futures possible or probable, that very few of them shared as serious a concern for the dangers as he seemed to. This concern led to his in-depth examination of the issue and the positions of others in the scientific community on it, and eventually, to his current activities regarding it.\n\nDespite this, he is a [[venture capital]]ist, investing in GNR technology companies.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/bill-joy/ \"Bill Joy on Venture Capital, Clean Tech, and Big Boats\"], Steven Levy, ''Wired Magazine'', April 16, 2013</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} He has also raised a specialty venture fund to address the dangers of pandemic diseases, such as the H5N1 [[avian influenza]] and biological weapons.\n\n==Joy's law==\n{{main|Joy's law (management)}}\nIn his 2013 book ''Makers'', author [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] credited Joy with establishing \"Joy's law\" based on a quip: \"No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else [other than you].\"<ref>Chris Anderson, ''[[Makers: The New Industrial Revolution]]'', 143.</ref> His argument was that companies use an inefficient process by not hiring the best employees, only those they are able to hire.

Here the bandwidth equals the upper frequency.]]\n\n'''Bandwidth''' is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous band of frequencies.  It is typically measured in [[hertz]], and depending on context, may specifically refer to ''passband bandwidth'' or  ''baseband bandwidth''. Passband bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower [[cutoff frequencies]] of, for example, a [[band-pass filter]], a [[communication channel]], or a [[signal spectrum]]. Baseband bandwidth applies to a [[low-pass filter]] or [[baseband signal]]; the bandwidth is equal to its upper cutoff frequency.\n\nBandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields, including [[electronics]], [[information theory]], [[digital communication]]s, [[radio communication]]s, [[signal processing]], and [[spectroscopy]] and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel.\n\nA key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of [[information]], regardless of where that band is located in the [[frequency spectrum]].<ref group=note>Assuming equivalent [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] level.</ref> For example, a 3&nbsp;kHz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at baseband (as in a [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone line) or [[modulated]] to some higher frequency.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nBandwidth is a key concept in many [[telecommunication]]s applications. In [[radio]] communications, for example, bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a modulated [[carrier signal]]. An [[FM radio]] receiver's [[tuner (radio)|tuner]] spans a limited range of frequencies.  A government agency (such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States) may apportion the regionally available bandwidth to [[broadcast license]] holders so that their [[signal (electronics)|signals]] do not mutually interfere. In this context, bandwidth is also known as [[channel spacing]].\n\nFor other applications there are other definitions. One definition of bandwidth, for a system, could be the range of frequencies over which the system produces a specified level of performance.  A less strict and more practically useful definition will refer to the frequencies beyond which Performance is degraded. In the case of [[frequency response]], degradation could, for example, mean more than 3&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] below the maximum value or it could mean below a certain absolute value. As with any definition of the ''width'' of a function, many definitions are suitable for different purposes.\n\nIn the context of, for example, the [[sampling theorem]] and [[Nyquist rate|Nyquist sampling rate]], bandwidth typically refers to [[baseband]] bandwidth. In the context of [[Nyquist rate|Nyquist symbol rate]] or [[Shannon-Hartley]] [[channel capacity]] for communication systems it refers to [[passband]] bandwidth.\n\nThe '''Rayleigh bandwidth''' of a simple radar pulse is defined as the inverse of its duration.  For example a one-microsecond pulse has a Rayleigh bandwidth of one megahertz.<ref>Jeffrey A. Nanzer, ''Microwave and Millimeter-wave Remote Sensing for Security Applications'', pp. 268-269, Artech House, 2012 {{ISBN|1608071723}}.</ref>\n\nThe '''essential bandwidth''' is defined as the portion of a [[signal spectrum]] in the frequency domain which contains most of the energy of the signal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundararajan|first=D.|title=A Practical Approach to Signals and Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Oo55lFE6UoC&pg=PA109|date=4 March 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82354-5|page=109}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--> \n\n== ''x'' dB bandwidth ==\n\n[[Image:Bandwidth 2.svg|right|300px|thumb|A graph of a [[band-pass filter]]'s gain magnitude, illustrating the concept of \u22123 dB bandwidth at a gain of approximately 0.707. The frequency axis of this symbolic diagram can be linear or [[logarithm]]ically scaled.]]\n\nIn some contexts, the signal bandwidth in [[hertz]] refers to the frequency range in which the signal's [[spectral density]] (in W/Hz or V<sup>2</sup>/Hz) is nonzero or above a small threshold value.  That definition is used in calculations of the lowest sampling rate that will satisfy the [[sampling theorem]].  The threshold value is often defined relative to the maximum value, and is most commonly the {{no wrap|[[3 dB point]]}}, that is the point where the spectral density is half its maximum value (or the spectral amplitude, in V or V/Hz, is 70.7% of its maximum).<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Network Analysis\n|edition=3rd\n|last=Van Valkenburg\n|first=M.

To say that a system has a certain bandwidth means that the system can process signals of that bandwidth, or that the system reduces the bandwidth of a white noise input to that bandwidth.\n\nThe 3&nbsp;dB bandwidth of an [[electronic filter]] or communication channel is the part of the system's frequency response that lies within 3&nbsp;dB of the response at its peak, which in the passband filter case is typically at or near its [[center frequency]], and in the low-pass filter is near 0 hertz. If the maximum gain is 0&nbsp;dB, the 3&nbsp;dB bandwidth is the frequency range where the gain is more than \u22123&nbsp;dB, or the attenuation is less than 3&nbsp;dB. This is also the range of frequencies where the amplitude gain is above 70.7% of the maximum amplitude gain, and the power gain is above half the maximum power gain. This same ''half-power gain'' convention is also used in [[spectral width]], and more generally for extent of functions as [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM).\n\nIn [[electronic filter]] design, a filter specification may require that within the filter [[passband]], the gain is nominally 0&nbsp;dB \u00b1 a small number of dB, for example within the \u00b11&nbsp;dB interval. In the [[stopband]](s), the required attenuation in dB is above a certain level, for example >100&nbsp;dB. In a [[transition band]] the gain is not specified. In this case, the filter bandwidth corresponds to the passband width, which in this example is the 1&nbsp;dB-bandwidth. If the filter shows amplitude ripple within the passband, the ''x'' dB point refers to the point where the gain is ''x'' dB below the nominal passband gain rather than ''x'' dB below the maximum gain.\n\n{{anchor|Fractional bandwidth}}A commonly used quantity is '''fractional bandwidth'''.  This is the bandwidth of a device divided by its center frequency. E.g., a passband filter that has a bandwidth of 2&nbsp;MHz with center frequency 10&nbsp;MHz will have a fractional bandwidth of 2/10, or 20%.\n\nIn communication systems, in calculations of the [[Shannon\u2013Hartley]] [[channel capacity]], bandwidth refers to the 3&nbsp;dB-bandwidth. In calculations of the maximum [[symbol rate]], the [[Nyquist sampling rate]], and maximum bit rate according to the [[Shannon\u2013Hartley#Hartley's law|Hartley formula]], the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non-zero, or the gain in dB is below a very large value.\n\nThe fact that in equivalent [[baseband]] models of communication systems, the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies, can lead to confusion about bandwidth, since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half, and one will occasionally see expressions such as <math>B = 2W</math>, where <math>B</math> is the total bandwidth (i.e. the maximum passband bandwidth of the carrier-modulated RF signal and the minimum passband bandwidth of the physical passband channel), and <math>W</math> is the positive bandwidth (the baseband bandwidth of the equivalent channel model).  For instance, the baseband model of the signal would require a [[low-pass filter]] with cutoff frequency of at least <math>W</math> to stay intact, and the physical passband channel would require a passband filter of at least <math>B</math> to stay intact.\n\nIn signal processing and [[control theory]] the bandwidth is the frequency at which the [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop system gain]] drops 3&nbsp;dB below peak.\n\nIn basic electric circuit theory, when studying band-pass and band-reject filters, the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the [[frequency domain]] where the signal is <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}</math> of the maximum signal amplitude (half power).\n\n== Antenna systems ==\n{{see also|Antenna (radio)#Bandwidth|Antenna measurement#Bandwidth}}\n\nIn the field of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], two different methods of expressing relative bandwidth are used for [[narrowband]] and [[wideband]] antennas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stutzman |first=Warren L. |first2=Gary A. |last2=Theiele |title=Antenna Theory and Design |edition=2nd |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-471-02590-9 }}</ref> For either, a set of criteria is established to define the extents of the bandwidth, such as [[input impedance]], [[pattern]], or [[Polarization (antenna)|polarization]].\n\n''Percent bandwidth'', usually used for [[narrowband]] antennas, is used defined as <math>\\%B=100 \\times \\frac{f_H-f_L}{f_c}=200 \\times \\frac{f_H-f_L}{f_H+f_L} </math>. The theoretical limit to percent bandwidth is 200%, which occurs for <math>f_L = 0</math>.\n\n''Fractional bandwidth or ratio bandwidth'', usually used for [[wideband]] antennas, is defined as <math>B = f_H/f_L,</math> and is typically presented in the form of <math>B:1</math>.

(1981). The evolution of the concept of the bodhisattva. In: Leslie S Kawamura, The Bodhisattva doctrine in Buddhism, Published for the Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion by Wilfred Laurier University Press, p.19</ref> and as a young man in his current life in the period during which he was working towards his own [[moksha|liberation]]. During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase \"When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta...\" The term therefore connotes a being who is \"bound for enlightenment\", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the P\u0101li canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the Jataka tales.\n\nAccording to the Therav\u0101da monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali [[Nikayas]] (and their counterparts such as the Chinese [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0100gamas]]) which instead focus on the ideal of the [[Arahant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/arahantsbodhisattvas.html|title=Arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas}}</ref> In later [[Theravada#Scriptures|Theravada literature]], the term \"bodhisatta\" is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation.<ref>[http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm \u5357\u50b3\u83e9\u85a9\u9053\uff08\u4e0a\uff09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410162534/http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm |date=April 10, 2008 }}</ref> The later tradition of commentary also recognizes two additional types of bodhisattas: the ''paccekabodhisatta'', who will attain [[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddhahood]], and the ''savakabodhisatta'', who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. In the 1st-2nd century BCE Sri Lankan work, the [[Buddhavamsa]], the idea of the person who makes a Bodhisatta vow to become a fully enlightened Buddha out of compassion for all sentient  beings is presented. Another related concept outlined in the Buddhavamsa and in another text called the [[Cariyapitaka]] is the need to cultivate certain Bodhisatta perfections or [[paramitas]]\n\n[[Image:DevoteeDetail.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Probable early image of a Bodhisattva ([[Bimaran casket]], 50 CE).<ref name=\"Crossroads\">\"The crossroads of Asia\", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and [[Joe Cribb]], The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, {{ISBN|0951839918}}, p.189-190</ref>]]\nKings of [[Sri Lanka]] were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247-249), who was renowned for his compassion, took vows for the welfare of the citizens, and was regarded as a [[Mah\u0101sattva|mah\u0101satta]] (Sanskrit ''mah\u0101sattva''), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana Buddhism.<ref>Holt, John.

He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs#House of Lambakanna II .28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956-972 CE), who had the words inscribed \"none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka,\" among other examples.<ref>Holt, John.

Three kinds of Bodhisattvas are mentioned in the early Mahayana texts: the forest, city, and monastery Bodhisattvas - with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101 and the [[Samadhiraja Sutra|Samadhiraja]] sutras.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 252.</ref> The early Rastrapalapariprccha sutra also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The Rastrapala is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 265.</ref> The Ratnagunasamcayagatha also says the Bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices ([[dhutanga]]), \"wander freely without a home\", practice the [[paramitas]] and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of [[prajnaparamita]].<ref>Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 255.</ref> These texts seem to indicate the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest [[asceticism]].\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the six perfections.<ref>''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}</ref> Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is [[parinamana|merit transference]] (''pari\u1e47\u0101man\u0101'').\n\nIn the ''[[Lotus S\u016btra]]'', life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that the house is ablaze and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of suffering). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from [[samsara]] and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the [[bodhicitta|mind of awakening]] (''bodhicitta'').\n\nA commonly repeated misconception in Western literature is that bodhisattvas delay their own liberation. This confusion is based on a misreading of several different scriptural concepts and narratives. One of these is the Tibetan teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to [[Patrul Rinpoche]]'s 19th century ''Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (''Kun bzang bla ma'i gzhal lung''), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:\n# King-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.\n# Boatman-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.\n# Shepherd-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.\n\nThese three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which buddhahood actually occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.<ref> ''Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of A Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.'' Translated by The Padmakara Translation Group. (Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1994), 218. </ref> The ritualized formulation of the bodhisattva vow also reflects this order (becoming a buddha so that one can then teach others to do the same). A bodhisattva vow ritual text attributed to [[N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]], of the second-third century CE, states the vow as follows: \"Just as the past tath\u0101gata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom.\" <ref> Nag\u0101rjuna.

The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a buddha in the presence of a previous buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that buddha. \n\nThe six perfections that constitute bodhisattva practice should not be confused with the actual acts of benefiting beings that the bodhisattva vows to accomplish once he or she is a buddha. The six perfections are a mental transformation and need not actually benefit anyone. This is seen in the story of [[Vessantara]], an incarnation of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha while he was still a bodhisattva, who commits the ultimate act of generosity by giving away his children to an evil man who mistreats them. Vessantara's actual acts do not benefit beings; in fact, he causes direct harm. However, the merit from his perfection of generosity fructifies in his lifetime as \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha when he attains complete enlightenment.<ref> \"Vessantara\" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 965. </ref>\n\n===Ten grounds===\n\nAccording to many traditions within Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bh\u016bmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bh\u016bmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'' and ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation,'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)\n\nBefore a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:\n#the path of accumulation\n#the path of preparation\n\nThe ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths\n#''bh\u016bmi'' 1 the path of insight\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 2-7 the path of meditation\n#''bh\u016bmis'' 8-10 the path of no more learning\n\nThe chapter of ten grounds in the ''Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:\n\n#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bh\u016bmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''p\u0101ramit\u0101s''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''d\u0101na'').\n#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bh\u016bmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bh\u016bmi'' is named \"stainless\". The emphasized perfection is [[\u015bila|moral discipline]] (''\u015b\u012bla'').\n#'''Luminous:''' The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third ''bh\u016bmi''. The emphasized perfection is [[k\u1e63anti|patience]] (''{{IAST|k\u1e63\u0101nti}}'').\n#'''Radiant:''' This ''bh\u016bmi'' it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[v\u012brya|vigor]] (''v\u012brya'').\n#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhy\u0101na'').\n#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra|{{IAST|sa\u1e43s\u0101ra}}]]'' or ''[[nirv\u0101\u1e47a|{{IAST|nirv\u0101\u1e47a}}]]'', so this state is \"obviously transcendent\".  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''praj\u00f1\u0101'').\n#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skillful means]] (''up\u0101ya''), to help others.\n#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This \"immovable\" ''bh\u016bmi'' is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.\n#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is power.\n#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.\n\nAfter the ten ''bh\u016bmis'', according to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.\n\nWith the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra]]'' recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajray\u0101na]] schools recognize 3\u201310 additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|title=\u0532\u03e2 - \u013f \u013c|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908080747/http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|archive-date=8 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html|title=\u5409\u7965\u9114\u91d1\u5bc6\u56b4\u5bfa|author=\u9114\u91d1\u65fa\u5ea6|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nA bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[mah\u0101sattva]]''.

Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokite\u015bvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n\n[[Ksitigarbha|K\u1e63itigarbha]] is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:\n\n{{quote|If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain [[Bodhi]].}}\n\nThe place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[Dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das. Perhaps the most famous bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da of all is the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|\u015a\u0101kyamu\u1e47i]] achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of [[Chinese Buddhism]], there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhima\u1e47\u1e0das for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople.

It has been a focal point for the [[British people]] at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\n\nOriginally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building at the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George&nbsp;III]] in 1761<ref name=\"rob14\">Robinson, p. 14.</ref> as a private residence for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] and became known as ''The Queen's House''. During the 19th&nbsp;century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837.\n\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War&nbsp;II; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].\n\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough|Sir&nbsp;Charles Long]]. [[Edward VII|King Edward&nbsp;VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The palace has 775 rooms, and [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the garden]] is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.\n\n==History==\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|Buckingham House, c. 1710, was designed by [[William Winde]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.<!--note - \"Normanby\" is correct spelling, do not change please --> This fa\u00e7ade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above it.]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.<ref>Goring, p. 15.</ref> Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th&nbsp;century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{efn|The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1\u20134.}}\n\nIn 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St&nbsp;James, which became [[St&nbsp;James's Palace]],<ref>Goring, p. 28.</ref> from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.<ref>Goring, p. 18.</ref> These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820|title=The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair|work=[[Survey of London]]|volume=39|chapter=Chapter 1: The Acquisition of the Estate|year=1977|pages=1\u20135|publisher=London County Council|accessdate=3 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious owners leased it from royal landlords and the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th&nbsp;century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.<ref>Wright, pp. 76\u201378.</ref> Needing money, [[James VI and I|James&nbsp;I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.)<ref>Goring, pp. 31, 36.</ref> [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery.

The airline is based in [[Waterside (building)|Waterside]] near its main [[Airline hub|hub]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]]. In January 2011 BA merged with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], creating the [[International Airlines Group]] (IAG), a [[holding company]] registered in [[Madrid]], Spain. IAG is the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in the [[FTSE 100 Index]].\n\nBA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[British European Airways]], and two regional airlines, [[Cambrian Airways]] from [[Cardiff]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]] from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways. After almost 13 years as a state company, BA was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Conservative government]]. The carrier expanded with the acquisition of [[British Caledonian]] in 1987, [[Dan-Air]] in 1992, and [[British Midland International]] in 2012. The airline has long been considered a national symbol of the [[United Kingdom]]'s status as a global power. Its preeminence also highlighted the reach of the country's influence as many of its destinations in several regions were historically part of the British Empire.\n\nA long-time [[Boeing]] customer, BA ordered 59 [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft in August 1998. In 2007 it purchased 12 [[Airbus A380]]s and 24 [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s, marking the start of its [[flight length|long-haul]] fleet replacement. The centrepiece of the airline's long-haul fleet is the [[Boeing 777]], with 58 in the fleet. BA is the largest operator of the [[Boeing 747-400]], with 41 registered to the airline. It is a founding member of the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Qantas]], and the now defunct [[Canadian Airlines]]. The alliance has since grown to become the third largest, after [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of British Airways}}\n[[File:British Airways Boeing 747-100 in BOAC basic livery Marmet.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 747-100]] in BOAC-British Airways transition livery]]\n\nProposals to establish a joint British airline, combining the assets of the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of [[Cyprus]]. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary [[Cyprus Airways]] to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the [[Middle East]]. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time, [[Rab Butler]]. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.<ref>Robin Higham, ''Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC'' (London: IB Tauris, 2013) p.117</ref>\n\nConsequently, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, managing both BEA and BOAC, and the two regional British airlines [[Cambrian Airways]] based at Cardiff, and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]] based at Newcastle upon Tyne, was constituted on 1 April 1972.<ref>''Airliner World (Cambrian Airways \u2013 The Welsh Dragon: New routes and turboprops)'', Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, September 2012, p. 71</ref> Although each airline's individual branding was maintained initially, two years later the British Airways Board unified its branding, effectively establishing British Airways as an airline on 31 March 1974.<ref name = EOP7>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1970-1979/public/en_gb|publisher=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1970\u20131979|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nFollowing two years of fierce competition with [[British Caledonian]], the second-largest airline in the [[United Kingdom]] at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |title = UK abandons long-haul competition |work=Flight International |date = 7 August 1975 |page = 173}}</ref>\n\nBritish Airways and [[Air France]] operated the [[supersonic]] airliner [[Concorde|Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde]], and the world's first [[supersonic]] passenger service flew in January 1976 from [[London Heathrow]] to [[Bahrain]].<ref name = 'Concordeintro3'>{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=inkRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5479,5052446|title=Concorde starts regular service|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date= 26 January 1976|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]] airport, and flights to [[John F.

This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall]] in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eug\u00e8ne Meyer of Paris.<ref>''Bulletin des lois de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise'' (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA648#v=onepage&q&f=false page 648, patent no. 86,705: \"Perfectionnements dans les roues de v\u00e9locip\u00e8des\"] (Improvements in the wheels of bicycles), issued: 4 August 1869.</ref> The French ''v\u00e9locip\u00e8de'', made of iron and wood, developed into the \"[[penny-farthing]]\" (historically known as an \"ordinary bicycle\", a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=50}} It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor [[weight distribution]]. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the [[Hillman#History|Coventry Machinists Company]]), brought a Michaux cycle to [[Coventry]], England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner [[James Starley]], used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.<ref>McGrory, David.

The first modern bicycle, it featured a rear-wheel-drive, [[chain-drive]]n cycle with two similar-sized wheels. Dunlop's [[pneumatic tire]] was added to the bicycle in 1888.]]\nThe ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the [[bicycle seat|seat]] further back. This, in turn, required gearing\u2014effected in a variety of ways\u2014to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman [[John Kemp Starley|J. K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful \"bicyclette\" of Englishman Henry Lawson),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=47}} connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as [[safety bicycle]]s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 [[Rover Company|Rover]], manufactured in Coventry<ref>McGrory, p. 222.</ref> is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}</ref> Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle ''diamond frame''.\n\n[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]\nFurther innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''.

The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Fork end|dropout]], where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.\n\n[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]].]]\nHistorically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'' or as an ''open frame'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a \"women's\" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.\n\nStep-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered \"unladylike\" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount - in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse [[sidesaddle]].\n\nAnother style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html |title=History Loudly Tells Why The Recumbent Bike Is Popular Today |publisher=Recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com |date=1934-04-01 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trek Y Foil.jpg|thumb|right|A carbon fiber [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Y-Foil from the late 1990s]]\nHistorically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind.{{Where?|date=August 2012}} More expensive bikes use [[carbon fibre]] due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than {{convert|1|kg|lb}}.\n\nOther exotic frame materials include [[titanium]] and advanced alloys.

Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.\n\nSince cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use [[hub gear]]s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient d\u00e9railleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A d\u00e9railleur system normally has two d\u00e9railleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the [[chainring]] and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.\n\nAn alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.\n\n[[Bicycle gearing|Different gears and ranges of gears]] are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.\n\nWith a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).\n\n===Steering===\n[[File:Anatomic bicycle grips made of leather.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle grips made of leather. Anatomic shape distributes weight over [[hand|palm area]] to prevent Cyclist's palsy ([[Ulnar tunnel syndrome|Ulnar syndrome]])<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12860549 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]</ref>]]\nThe [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] turn the fork and the front wheel via the [[Stem (bike)|stem]], which rotates within the headset. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' \"drop\" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic \"crouched\" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.\n\n===Seating===\n[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]\n[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.\n\nA recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].\n\n===Brakes===\n{{Main|Bicycle brake}}\n[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]\nBicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2013/10/disc-brakes-and-road-bikes-what-does-the-future-hold/ |title=Disc Brakes and Road Bikes: What does the Future Hold? |publisher=cyclingtips.com.au |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |author=Wade Wallace}}</ref> [[Disc brakes]] are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html |title=Disc Brakes |publisher=sheldonbrown.com |author=John Allan |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]\nWith hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or [[hydraulic]] lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s.\n\n[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.sheldonbrown.com/fixed.html\n| title = Fixed Gear Conversions: Braking\n| last = Brown\n| first = Sheldon\n| accessdate = 2009-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090209002353/http://sheldonbrown.com/fixed.html| archivedate= 9 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===Suspension===\n{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}\n\nBicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.\n\nBicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.\n\nBasic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.\n\n===Wheels and tires===\n{{Main|Bicycle wheel|Bicycle tire}}\n\nThe wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built \"off the shelf\", performance-oriented wheels.\n\nTires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. [[Road bicycles]] use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or [[slick tire|slick]], and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between {{Convert|38|and|64|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.\n\n===Accessories===\n[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders/mud-guards, water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four [[pannier]]s and a handlebar bag.]]\n\nSome components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. [[Mudguard]]s, or [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], protect the cyclist and [[moving parts]] from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep bicycles upright when parked, and [[bike lock]]s deter theft. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]], front or rear [[luggage carrier]]s or racks, and [[pannier]]s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]], an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children.

Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 pounds per square inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by [[goat's head]]s and other [[bur]]s, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.\n\nSome bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, require considerable torque for dis-assembly and may thus need professional services. [[Self-service]] and assisted-service [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] may be available.\n\n* Some cyclists choose self-service: they maintain their own bicycles, perhaps as part of their enjoyment of the hobby of cycling or simply for economic reasons.\n* There exist several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Bicycle Organizations|url=http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community_Bicycle_Organizations|publisher=Bike Collective Network wiki|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref> At a Community Bicycle Organization, [[wikt:layperson#Noun|laypeople]] bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.\n* Full service is available from [[bicycle mechanic]]s at a [[local bike shop]].

Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}}\n\nThe 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the [[United Nations]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflector|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a [[car horn]] can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nSome countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed [[safety in numbers]] effect).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Theft===\n[[File:2008-09-06 Solitary bicycle wheel in a bike rack.jpg|thumb|upright|A bicycle wheel remains chained in a bike rack after the rest of the bicycle has been stolen at east campus of [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].]]\n{{Main|Bicycle theft}}\nBicycles are popular targets for theft, due to their value and ease of resale.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Lierop|first=Dea|last2=Grimsrud|first2=Michael|last3=El-Geneidy|first3=Ahmed|year=2014|title=Breaking into Bicycle Theft: Insights from Montreal, Canada|url=|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Transportation|volume=|pages=490\u2013501|via=}}</ref> The number of bicycles stolen annually is difficult to quantify as a large number of crimes are not reported.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicyclelaw.com/p.cfm/bicycle-safety/about-bike-theft |title=About Bicycle Theft |publisher=bicyclelaw.com |accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> Around 50% of the participants in the [[Montreal]] International Journal of Sustainable Transportation survey were subjected to a bicycle theft in their lifetime as active cyclists.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://tram.mcgill.ca/Research/Publications/Cycling_theft.pdf|title = Breaking into bicycle theft: Insights from Montreal, Canada|last = van Lierop Grimsrud El-Geneidy|date = 2015|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation|doi = |pmid = |access-date = September 30, 2015}}</ref> Most bicycles have serial numbers that can be recorded to verify identity in case of theft.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://bikeindex.org/serials#fn-all-bikes-serials\n| title = Bike serial numbers\n| quote = Okay, fine, so maybe there are a few bikes without serial numbers, but this is rare and typical only on hand made bikes or really old bicycles. \n| accessdate = 2017-08-02}}</ref>\n\n== Longest bicycle ==\nThe worlds longest bicycle was created by Santos and University of South Australia.

About 33 percent of all plant matter is cellulose. The cellulose content of cotton is 90 percent, for wood it is 50 percent.<ref>\nKlemm, D., Heublein, B., Fink, H., and Bohn, A., \"Cellulose: \nFascinating Biopolymer / Sustainable Raw Material\", Ang. Chemie (Intl. Edn.) Vol. 44, p. 3358 (2004) \n</ref>\n\n== Vs synthetic polymers ==\n\nA major defining difference between '''biopolymers''' and '''synthetic''' polymers can be found in their structures. All polymers are made of repetitive units called [[monomer]]s. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example: [[lignocellulose]]): \nThe exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the [[primary structure]], in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also \"[[protein folding]]\"  as well as [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]]), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. [[Structural biology]] is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.\nIn contrast, most '''synthetic polymers''' have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers.\nIn fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process in most ''in vivo'' systems, all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called [[monodispersity]] in contrast to the [[polydispersity]] encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result, biopolymers have a [[polydispersity index]] of 1.<ref>\nStupp, S.I and Braun, P.V., \"Role of Proteins in Microstructural Control: Biomaterials, Ceramics & Semiconductors\", Science, Vol. 277, p. 1242 (1997)\n</ref>\n\n== Conventions and nomenclature ==\n\n=== Polypeptides ===\n\nThe convention for a [[polypeptide]] is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus. The amino acid residues are always joined by [[peptide bond]]s. [[Protein]], though used colloquially to refer to any polypeptide, refers to larger or fully functional forms and can consist of several polypeptide chains as well as single chains. Proteins can also be modified to include non-peptide components, such as [[saccharide]] chains and [[lipid]]s.\n\n=== Nucleic acids ===\nThe convention for a [[nucleic acid]] sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the [[polymer chain]], where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.\n\n=== Sugars ===\nSugar-based biopolymers are often difficult with regards to convention. Sugar polymers can be linear or branched and are typically joined with [[glycosidic bond]]s. The exact placement of the linkage can vary, and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in \u03b1- and \u03b2-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as [[amination]], and can even form parts of other molecules, such as [[glycoprotein]]s.\n\n== Structural characterization ==\nThere are a number of [[biophysics|biophysical]] techniques for determining sequence information. [[Peptide sequence|Protein sequence]] can be determined by [[Edman degradation]], in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass [[spectrometer]] techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel [[electrophoresis]] and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using [[optical tweezers]] or [[atomic-force microscopy]]. [[Dual polarization interferometry]] can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.\n\n== As materials ==\nSome biopolymers- such as  [[Polylactic acid|PLA]], naturally occurring [[zein]], and [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] can be used as plastics, replacing the need for [[polystyrene]] or [[polyethylene]] based plastics.\n\nSome plastics are now referred to as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) [[oil]]-based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the [[European Union directive]] on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic [[composting]].<ref name=\"nnfcc\">[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-polymers-factsheet-bioplastics NNFCC Renewable Polymers Factsheet: Bioplastics]</ref>\n\nBiopolymers (also called renewable polymers) are produced from [[biomass]] for use in the packaging industry. Biomass comes from crops such as sugar beet, potatoes or wheat: when used to produce biopolymers, these are classified as [[non food crops]]. These can be converted in the following pathways:\n\n[[Sugar beet]] &gt; Glyconic acid &gt; Polyglyconic acid\n\n[[Starch]] &gt; (fermentation) &gt; [[Lactic acid]] &gt; [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA)\n\n[[Biomass]] &gt; (fermentation) &gt; [[Bioethanol]] &gt; [[Ethene]] &gt; [[Polyethylene]]\n\nMany types of packaging can be made from biopolymers: food trays, blown starch pellets for shipping fragile goods, thin films for wrapping.\n\n===Environmental impacts===\nBiopolymers can be sustainable, carbon neutral and are always [[renewable]], because they are made from plant materials which can be grown indefinitely. These plant materials come from agricultural [[non food crops]]. Therefore, the use of biopolymers would create a [[sustainable]] industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut [[carbon emissions]] and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO<sub>2</sub> released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to [[carbon neutral]].\n\nBiopolymers are biodegradable, and some are also compostable. Some biopolymers are [[biodegradable]]: they are broken down into CO<sub>2</sub> and water by [[microorganisms]]. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are [[compostable]]: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20\u03bcm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are \"biodegradable\".<ref>[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-5-biopolymers-a-renewable-resource-for-the-plastics-industry NNFCC Newsletter \u2013 Issue 5.

Thursday 7 June 2001, four years after the previous election on 1 May 1997,  to elect [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2001|659 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]], the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another [[landslide victory]], returning 413 of the 418 seats won by the party in the previous general election, a net loss of 5 seats, though with significantly lower turnout than before\u201459.4%, compared to 71.3% in the previous election. Tony Blair went on to become the first Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to serve a consecutive full term in office. It was dubbed \"the quiet landslide\" by the media.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Parkinson|first1=Justin|title=The rise and fall of New Labour|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-10518842|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=3 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere was little change outside [[Northern Ireland]], with 620 out of the 641 seats electing candidates from the same party as they did in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. Factors contributing to the Labour victory were a strong economy and falling unemployment, as well as that Labour was seen as having delivered on many key election pledges that it had made in 1997.\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], under [[William Hague]]'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of [[European Union|Europe]] and the party's policy platform was considered to have shifted to a right wing focus. Hague was also hindered by a series of embarrassing publicity stunts, and resigned as party leader three months later, becoming the first leader of the Conservative or Unionist party in the House of Commons since [[Austen Chamberlain]] to not also be [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe election was essentially a repeat of the 1997 election, with Labour losing only 6 seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of one seat (gaining nine seats, but losing eight). The Conservatives did manage to gain [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (UK Parliament constituency)| a seat]] in [[Scotland]], which ended the party's status as an 'England-only' party in the prior parliament, but once again were left unrepresented in Wales. Although they did not gain many seats, one of the new MPs elected was future Conservative Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] gained six seats.\n\nThe 2001 election is the last to date in which any government has held an overall majority of more than 100 seats in the House of Commons, and one of only two since the Second World War (the other being 1997) in which one party won over 400 MPs. It was also the last election at which Labour secured over 40% of the popular vote until the snap election in 2017. \n\nChange was seen in [[Northern Ireland]], with the moderately [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party]] losing four seats to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]].  This transition was mirrored in the nationalist community with the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] losing votes to the more staunchly republican and [[abstentionist]] [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nThe election was also marked with exceptionally low voter turnout, falling below 60% for the first (and so far, only) time since 1918.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election Statistics: UK 1918\u20132007|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2008/rp08-012.pdf|page=18|date=1 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The election was broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Andrew Marr]], [[Peter Snow]] and [[David Dimbleby]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6weF6Q37F2w&feature=mfu_in_order&playnext=1&videos=UsHbCo8smUk| BBC Vote 2001 Coverage</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with [[United Kingdom local elections, 2001|local elections]], but both were postponed because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|foot and mouth outbreak]].\n\nThe elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|Coupon Election]] of 1918. Throughout the election the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some [[bookmaker]]s paid out for a Labour majority before the election day.\n\nHowever, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel.\n\nBy the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been solved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1322000/1322211.stm |work=BBC News |title=Tories 'to cut fuel duty' |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 Election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOne of the more noted events of a quiet campaign was when countryside protester Craig Evans threw an egg at [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] in [[Rhyl]]; Prescott then punched him and a struggle ensued, in front of television cameras.\n\n2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr. Richard Taylor]] of [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] (usually now known simply as \"Health Concern\") unseated a government minister. There was also a high vote for [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] in [[Oldham]], in the wake of recent [[2001 Oldham riots|race riots]] in the town.\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] away from support for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], with the moderate unionist [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small [[UK Unionist Party]] lost its only seat.\n\n== Campaign ==\nFor Labour, the last four years had run relatively smoothly. The party had successfully defended all their [[List of United Kingdom by-elections|by election]] seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start.\n\nMany in the party however were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in the \"Hague with Lady Thatcher's hair\" poster.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Get out and vote. Or they get in.}}</ref> Despite recessions in mainland Europe and the United States, due to the bursting of global tech bubbles, Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.\n\nFor [[William Hague]], however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on [[United Kingdom and the euro|joining the Eurozone]] was rife. As Labour remained at the political centre, the Tories moved to the right. A policy gaffe by [[Oliver Letwin]] over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon took advantage of.\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at PMQs, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech at Conservative conference at the age of 16. The Sun newspaper only added to the Conservatives woes by backing Labour once again, calling Hague a \"dead parrot\".<ref>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg</ref>\n\nThe Tories campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled [[Norman Tebbit|\"Tebbit Trinity\"]]. However, Labour countered by asking where the proposed tax cuts were going to come from, and decried the Tory policy as \"cut here, cut there, cut everywhere\", in reference to the widespread belief that the Conservatives would make major cuts to public services in order to fund tax cuts.\n\nFor the Liberal Democrats, this was the first election for leader [[Charles Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nDuring the election Sharron Storer, a resident of [[Birmingham]], criticised Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in front of television cameras about conditions in the [[National Health Service]]. The widely televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in Birmingham. Sharron Storer's [[domestic partner|partner]], Keith Sedgewick, a cancer patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the [[bone marrow]] unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Government and Politics: A Comparative Guide |author=Duncan Watts|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MiTDykvtbEkC&pg=PA320&lpg=PA320&dq=%22Sharron+Storer%22|isbn=978-0-7486-2323-5|postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334131.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 VOTE2001 \u2013 Ambush upset Blair's day|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334903.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 VOTE2001 \u2013 Cancer patient's partner confronts Blair|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Opinion polling ==\n{{Main|Opinion polling for the United Kingdom general election, 2001}}\n\n== Results ==\nThe election result was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour Party retained an overwhelming majority with [[BBC]] announcing the victory at 02:58 on the early morning of the 8th June. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the United Kingdom had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament. Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60%, 12% down on 1997. All of the 3 main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | work=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nFor the Conservatives, this huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining 9 seats the Tories lost 7 to the Liberal Democrats, and one even to Labour. The inevitable result was the speedy resignation of [[William Hague]] in the election aftermath resigning at 07:44 outside the Conservative Party headquarters. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky, although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic [[Tony Blair]] in the peak of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament.\n\nStaying at what they considered rock bottom however showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s. But in Scotland, despite gaining one seat from the SNP, their vote collapse continued. They failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour romps home again | date=8 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under [[Charles Kennedy]], gaining more seats than the main two parties \u2013 albeit only six overall \u2013 and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in parliament and not just representing a protest vote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe SNP failed to gain any seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. Plaid Cymru both gained a seat from Labour and lost one to them.\n\nIn [[2001 United Kingdom general election results in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] the Ulster Unionists, despite gaining North Down, lost 5 other seats.\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:62.7%;\" | '''413'''\n|

According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for \"bringing them forth\", i.e., translating them.

Exceptions include the [[Words of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Ether]]. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).\n\nMost modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the \"Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]\" and the \"Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]]\".\n\n===Chronology===\n{{Main article|Book of Mormon chronology}}\nThe books from [[Book of First Nephi|First Nephi]] to [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are described as being from \"the small plates of Nephi\".<ref>{{lds|''Book of Mormon,'' Words of Mormon|w_of_m|1|3}}</ref> This account begins in ancient [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the [[Arabian peninsula]], and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.<ref>{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|18|23}}</ref> These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s, that frequently warred with each other.\n\nFollowing this section is the [[Words of Mormon]]. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], is a short introduction to the books of [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]], [[Book of Alma|Alma]], [[Book of Helaman|Helaman]], [[Book of Third Nephi|Third Nephi]], and [[Book of Fourth Nephi|Fourth Nephi]].<ref name=\"Brief-explanation\">[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/explanation \"A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon\"].</ref> These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called \"the large plates of Nephi\" that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The [[Book of Third Nephi]] is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the [[Americas]] sometime after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the [[Gospels]] of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.\n\nThe portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the [[Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)|Book of Mormon]] is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.\n\nAccording to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the [[Book of Ether]]) of a record from a previous people called the [[Jaredites]].<ref name=\"Brief-explanation\"/> The account describes a group of families led from the [[Tower of Babel]]<ref>{{lds|Ether|ether|1|3}}</ref> to the Americas, headed by a man named [[Jared (Book of Mormon)|Jared]] and [[The Brother of Jared|his brother]]. The [[Jaredite]] civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,<ref>Joseph L. Allen, ''Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands'' (2003) p. 8.</ref>\u2014long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC\u2014and as being much larger and more developed.\n\nThe [[Book of Moroni]] then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] state of the remaining society.<ref>[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro \"Book of Moroni\"].</ref> It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's [[testimony]] and an invitation to [[prayer|pray]] to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.<ref>{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|4}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrinal and philosophical teachings===\n[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A.

Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 \"Revised Authorized Edition\", which attempts to modernize some language.\n\nIn 2001, Community of Christ President [[W. Grant McMurray]] reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: \"The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.\"<ref>McMurray, W.

Veazey]] ruled out-of-order a resolution to \"reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.\" He stated that \"while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.\"<ref>Andrew M.

These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.\n\n==Historical authenticity==\n{{Main article|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}\n{{See also|Criticism of the Book of Mormon|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}\n\nThe archaeological, historical and scientific communities do not consider the Book of Mormon an ancient record of actual historical events. Their skepticism tends to focus on four main areas:\n\n* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and known, intact American archaeological sites.<ref>Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): \"As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.\"</ref>\n* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-[[Pleistocene]], [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America, frequently referred to as [[anachronisms]]. Items typically listed include [[cattle]],<ref>1 Nephi 18:25<br />LDS scholars think that this may be a product of reassigning familiar labels to unfamiliar items. For example, the Delaware Indians named the cow after the deer, and the Miami Indians labeled sheep, when they were first seen, \"looks-like-a cow.\"<br />John L.

However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:<br />Simon G. Southerton. 2004. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church''. Signature Books.<br />The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.\" ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'\" (pg 191)<br />Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]</ref>\n\nMost adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.<ref name = historicallyaccurate>\"The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith\", [[Simon G. Southerton]] (2004, Signature Books), ''Losing a Lost Tribe'', pp. 164-165.<br>\"Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church\", Southerton (2004), pg. 201.<br>Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as \"children of Lehi\" (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).<br>\"Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets\", Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), \"Introduction,\" ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'', ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x.</ref> Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]] groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by [[FARMS|Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), and [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the [[limited geography model]], which states that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either [[Mesoamerica]], [[South America]], or the [[Great Lakes]] area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/01/mounting-evidence-for-the-book-of-mormon |title= Mounting Evidence for the Book of Mormon |first= Daniel C. |last= Peterson |authorlink= Daniel C.

At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures.  One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text.  To that latter end, [[Stanley R. Larson]] (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project\u2014which he completed in 1974.  To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by [[Joseph Smith]] to his scribes) and the Printer's Manuscript (the copy [[Oliver Cowdery]] prepared for the Printer in 1829\u20131830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original.<ref>Stanley R. Larson, \u201cA Study of Some Textual Variations in the Book of Mormon, Comparing the Original and Printer's MSS., and Comparing the 1830, 1837, and 1840 Editions,\u201d unpublished master's thesis (Provo: BYU, 1974).</ref>  Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered.<ref>Stanley Larson, \u201cEarly Book of Mormon Texts: Textual Changes to the Book of Mormon in 1837 and 1840,\u201d ''Sunstone'', 1/4 (Fall 1976), 44\u201355; Larson, \u201cTextual Variants in the Book of Mormon Manuscripts,\u201d ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 10/4 (Autumn 1977), 8\u201330 [FARMS Reprint LAR-77]; Larson,  \u201cConjectural Emendation and the Text of the Book of Mormon,\u201d ''BYU Studies'', 18 (Summer 1978), 563\u2013569 [FARMS Reprint LAR-78].</ref>  Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.\n\nBy 1979, with the establishment of the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] ([[FARMS]]) as a California non-profit research institution, an effort led by [[Robert F. Smith (historian)|Robert F. Smith]] began to take full account of Larson's work and to publish a Critical Text of the Book of Mormon.  Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984.  The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work,<ref>Robert F. Smith, ed., ''Book of Mormon Critical Text'', 2nd ed., 3 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 1986\u20131987).</ref> greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate [[Grant Hardy]], Dr. [[Gordon C. Thomasson]], Professor [[John W. Welch]] (the head of FARMS), Professor [[Royal Skousen]], and others too numerous to mention here.  However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project.\n\nIn 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, Professor Skousen took over as editor and head of the FARMS Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.  He also closely examined the Printer's Manuscript (then owned by the [[Community of Christ]]\u2014RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made.  He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.\n\nThus far, Professor Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer's Manuscripts,<ref>''The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'' (Provo: FARMS, 2001); ''The Printer's Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'', 2 vols. (FARMS, 2001).</ref> as well as a six-volume analysis of textual variants.<ref>''Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon'', 6 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 2004\u20132009) -- now superseded by a second ed.</ref>  Still in preparation are a history of the text, and a complete electronic collation of editions and manuscripts (volumes 3 and 5 of the Project, respectively).  Yale University has in the meantime published an edition of the Book of Mormon which incorporates all aspects of Skousen's research.<ref>Skousen, ed., ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'' (Yale Univ. Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDifferences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past<ref name=\"Brody\"/><ref name=\"Krakauer\"/><ref name=\"Skousen\"/> with Mormon scholars viewing the changes as superficial, done to clarify the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"Book of Mormon textual changes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Textual_changes|title=Book of Mormon textual changes|last=|first=|date=|website=Fairmormon|publisher=Fairmormon|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-English translations ===\n[[File:Book of Mormon translations.jpg|130px|right|thumb|Translations of the Book of Mormon]]\n{{See also|List of Book of Mormon translations}}\nThe LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages.

For something to become a matter of faith and practice, it is not sufficient for it to be merely ''consistent with'' and not contrary to scriptural principles. It must be something ''explicitly'' ordained through command or example in the Bible. For instance, this is why Baptists do not practice infant baptism\u2014they say the Bible neither commands nor exemplifies infant baptism as a Christian practice. More than any other Baptist principle, this one when applied to infant baptism is said to separate Baptists from other evangelical Christians.\n* Baptists believe that faith is a matter between God and the individual ([[religious freedom]]). To them it means the advocacy of absolute liberty of conscience.\n* Insistence on immersion as the only mode of baptism. Baptists do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation.

Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word \"crisis\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"to decide.\" Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be \"positive and highly productive.\" He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results.

A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], to return to a more fundamental church.{{Sfn | Christian | 1926 | pp = 421\u201336}}\n\n===Slavery crisis===\n{{see also|Christian views on slavery}}\n\n====United States====\n[[File:First Baptist Church, Augusta GA 20160703 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[First Baptist Church (Augusta, Georgia)|First Baptist Church]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]] where the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded]]\nLeading up to the [[American Civil War]], Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over [[slavery in the United States]]. Whereas in the First [[Great Awakening]] [[Methodist]] and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the [[American Baptist Home Mission Society|Home Mission Society]] refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the board did not want to appear to condone slavery.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was formed by nine state conventions in 1845. They believed that the Bible sanctions slavery and that it was acceptable for Christians to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh. By this time many planters were part of Baptist congregations, and some of the denomination's prominent preachers, such as the Rev. [[Basil Manly, Sr.]], president of the [[University of Alabama]], were also [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] who owned slaves.\n\nAs early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies. Blacks set up some independent Baptist congregations in the South before the [[American Civil War]]. White Baptist associations maintained some oversight of these and, after a slave rebellion, required a white man to be at church services.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the postwar years, [[freedmen]] quickly left the white congregations and associations, setting up their own churches in order to be free of white supervision.<ref>{{citation|first=Leroy|last=Fitts|title=A History of Black Baptists|pages=43\u2013106|place= Nashville, TN | publisher = Broadman Press|year=1985}}</ref> In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Kentucky]]. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]]. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second-largest Baptist organization in the world.<ref>Fitts (1985)</ref>  Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast.<ref>{{citation|publisher=Department of Geography and Meteorology, [[Valparaiso University]] |format=[[GIFF]] |url=http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/baptist.gif |title=Baptists as a Percentage of all Residents, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522053048/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/baptist.gif |archivedate=22 May 2010 |df=dmy }}.</ref>  In 2007, the [[Pew Research Center]]'s Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically black tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Religious Portrait of African-Americans| publisher = Pew forum | url= http://www.pewforum.org/A-Religious-Portrait-of-African-Americans.aspx}}</ref>\n\n====Caribbean islands====\n{{quote| A healthy Church kills error, and tears evil in pieces!

In Jamaica, for example, [[William Knibb]], a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the [[British West Indies]] (which took place in full in 1838). Knibb also supported the creation of \"[[Free Villages]]\" and sought funding from English Baptists to buy land for freedmen to cultivate; the Free Villages were envisioned as rural communities to be centred around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. [[Thomas Burchell]], missionary minister in [[Montego Bay]], also was active in this movement, gaining funds from Baptists in England to buy land for what became known as Burchell Free Village.\n\nPrior to emancipation, Baptist deacon [[Samuel Sharpe]], who served with Burchell, organized a general strike of slaves seeking better conditions. It developed into a major rebellion of as many as 60,000 slaves, which became known as the Christmas Rebellion (when it took place) or the [[Baptist War]]. It was put down by government troops within two weeks. During and after the rebellion, an estimated 200 slaves were killed outright, with more than 300 judicially executed later by prosecution in the courts, sometimes for minor offenses.\n\nBaptists were active after emancipation in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica's [[Calabar High School]], named after the port of [[Calabar]] in Nigeria, was founded by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free blacks formed their own [[Spiritual Baptist]] movements - breakaway spiritual movements which theology often expressed resistance to oppression.<ref>{{citation|first=Jean|last=Besson|title=Martha Brae's Two Histories | place= Chapel Hill | publisher = University of North Carolina |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Memory of slavery===\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

Americans have often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black memory by analyzing Baptist sermons documented in Alabama. Soon after the Civil War, most black Baptists in the South left the Southern Baptist Convention, reducing its numbers by hundreds of thousands or more.{{cn|date=July 2018}} They quickly organized their own congregations and developed their own regional and state associations and, by the end of the 19th century, a national convention.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nWhite preachers in Alabama after Reconstruction expressed the view that:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission \u2013 to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and \"traditional\" race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.}}\n\nBlack preachers interpreted the Civil War, Emancipation and Reconstruction as:\n\"God's gift of freedom.\" They had a gospel of liberation, having long identified with the [[Book of Exodus]] from slavery in the Old Testament. They took opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they quickly formed their own churches, associations, and conventions to operate freely without white supervision. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, a place to develop and use leadership, and places for proclamation of the gospel of liberation. As a result, black preachers said that God would protect and help him and God's people; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52-53</ref>\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention supported white supremacy and its results: [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites]] at the turn of the 20th century by raising barriers to voter registration, and passage of [[racial segregation]] laws that enforced the system of [[Jim Crow]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Its members largely resisted the [[civil rights movement]] in the South, which sought to enforce their constitutional rights for public access and voting; and enforcement of midcentury federal civil rights laws.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, \"unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin\" and \"lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.\" It offered an apology to all African Americans for \"condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime\" and repentance for \"racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.\"  Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the convention, predominantly white since the Reconstruction era, had specifically addressed the issue of slavery.\n\nThe statement sought forgiveness \"from our African-American brothers and sisters\" and pledged to \"eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry.\" In 1995 about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination were African Americans and another 300,000 were [[ethnic]] minorities.

It is played with one or more [[Playing card|decks]] of 52 cards, and is the most widely played [[casino game|casino]] banking game in the world.<ref name=\"Scarne\">{{cite book |last1=Scarne |first1=John |title=Scarne's new complete guide to gambling |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0671630638 |edition=Fully rev., expanded , updated}}</ref>{{rp|342}} The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:\n\n* Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a \"blackjack\" or \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"), without a dealer blackjack;\n* Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or\n* Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.\n\nPlayers are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table at which you sit. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down \n(hidden). In most other countries, the dealer receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"soft\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".\n\nOnce all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer\u2019s turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a \"push\", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins.\n\nBlackjack has many rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of [[Advantage gambling|advantage players]], particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly.\n\nBlackjack has inspired other casino games, including [[Spanish 21]] and [[Pontoon (card game)|pontoon]].\n\n==History==\nBlackjack's precursor was ''twenty-one'', a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale \"[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]\", from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheats working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''veintiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the [[ace]] values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish ''[[Spanish playing cards|baraja]]'' deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en Espa\u00f1a.

One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the [[ace of spades]] and a black [[jack (playing card)|jack]] (either the [[jack of clubs]] or the [[jack of spades]]). This hand was called a \"blackjack\", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a ''blackjack'' refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.<ref name=\"Scarne\" />{{rp|350}}\n\nThe first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956.  Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled ''The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack'' in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  This paper would become the foundation of all future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. [[Ed Thorp]] would use Baldwin\u2019s hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book Beat the Dealer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackjack History and Events|url=https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/historical-events/|publisher=blackjackreview.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rules of play at casinos==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Blackjack example game\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align =\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Blackjack game 1.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | caption1  = Initial deal\n | image2    = Blackjack game 2.JPG\n | width2    = 250\n | caption2  = Player action\n | image3    = Blackjack game 3.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n | caption3  = Dealer's hand revealed\n | image4    = Blackjack game 4.JPG\n | width4    = 250\n | caption4  = Bets settled\n }}\nAt a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight [[standard 52-card deck]]s are [[shuffling|shuffled]] together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the \"betting box\" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to \"play behind\". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.\n\nThe dealer deals cards from his/her left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as \"first base\") to his/her far right (\"third base\"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in \"hole card\" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, \"no hole card\" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.\n\nCards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).\n\nThe players' object is to win money by creating card totals that turn out to be higher than the dealer's hand but do not exceed 21 (\"busting\"/\"breaking\"), or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she busts. On their turn, players must choose whether to \"hit\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn), \"double\" (double wager, take a single card and finish), \"split\" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or \"surrender\" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as \"face cards\" or \"pictures\") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or \"soft 17\", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a \"natural\" or \"blackjack\" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as \"push\" or \"standoff\",  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.<ref name=LVSun20031113/>\n\nBlackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as \"Dealer Match\" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.\n\n===Player decisions===\n{{anchor|doubledown}}\n{{redirect|Doubling Down|the South Park episode|Doubling Down (South Park)}}\nAfter receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, \"surrender\".\n* '''Hit:''' Take another card from the dealer.\n: ''Signal'': Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Stand:''' Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\".\n: ''Signal'': Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Double down:''' The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n* '''Split''': If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.\n* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to \"surrender\" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.\n: ''Signal'': The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal. \n\nHand signals are used to assist the \"[[eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]\", a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.\nEach hand may normally \"hit\" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in [[counterclockwise]] order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.\n\n===Insurance===\nIf the dealer's upcard is an ace, the player is offered the option of taking \"insurance\" before the dealer checks the hole card.\n\nInsurance is a side bet that the dealer has blackjack and is treated independently of the main wager. It pays 2:1 (meaning that the player receives two dollars for every dollar bet) and is available when the dealer's exposed card is an ace. The idea is that the dealer's second card has a fairly high probability (nearly one-third) to be ten-valued, giving the dealer blackjack and disappointment for the player. It is attractive (although not necessarily wise) for the player to insure against the possibility of a dealer blackjack by making a maximum \"insurance\" bet, in which case the \"insurance proceeds\" will make up for the concomitant loss on the original bet. The player may add up to half the value of their original bet to the insurance and these extra chips are placed on a portion of the table usually marked \"Insurance pays 2 to 1\".\n\nPlayers with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they commit themselves to winning an amount exactly equal to their main wager, regardless of the dealer's outcome. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as \"taking even money\", and paid out immediately, before the dealer's hand is resolved; the players do not need to place more chips for the insurance wager.\n\nInsurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance|variation]], they might choose to pay for this.\n\nFurthermore, the insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.\n\nBets to insure against blackjack are slightly less likely to be advantageous than insurance bets in general, since the ten in the player's blackjack makes it less likely that the dealer has blackjack too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/insurance.htm|title=Blackjack Insurance Exceptions|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref><!--is this true? blackjack also means that the player can't have *two* tens, which would make insurance worse.-->\n\n==Rule variations and effects on house edge==\n''Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in [[percentage point]]s, not percentage; strictly speaking if, say, an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, the amount is reduced by ten percent, or by one percentage point.''\n[[File:Double down.JPG|thumb|right|Doubling down. The third card is placed at right angles to signify that the player cannot receive any more cards.]]\nThe rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rules of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table, failing which there is an expectation that casino staff will provide them on request. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm|title=Blackjack Rules - 113 variations|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\nAs with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a \"house edge\", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater.\n\n*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''\n[[File:Soft17.jpg|thumb|right|A \"soft 17\" in blackjack.  An ace and any combination of 6.]]\n:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated \"H17\" in blackjack literature, with \"S17\" used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an \"H17\" rule with an \"S17\" rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.\n\n*'''Number of decks'''\n:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.\n\n:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.\n\n:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number of decks !! House advantage\n|-\n| Single deck || 0.17%\n|-\n| Double deck || 0.46%\n|-\n| Four decks || 0.60%\n|-\n| Six decks || 0.64%\n|-\n| Eight decks || 0.65%\n|}\n\n;Late/early surrender:\n\nSurrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as \"late\" surrender. The alternative, \"early\" surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.\n\nFor late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.\n\n;Resplitting: If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or \"resplit\". The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, \"resplit to 4\").\n;Hit/resplit split aces: After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a \"soft 21\" and not a \"natural\".\n;No double after split: After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.\n;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: Under the \"[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule\", double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13\u201318, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19\u201320 and hard 8,7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around one in 1000, and its European version by around two in 1000.\n;No hole card and OBO:\n\nIn most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of A's against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.\n\nThe \"original bets only\" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (\"original\") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. \"Original bets only\" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm|title=Modern Blackjack|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\n;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower [[Table limit|table minimums]]. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack.<ref name=LVSun20031113>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/taking-a-hit-new-blackjack-odds-further-tilt-advan/ ''Taking a hit: New blackjack odds further tilt advantage toward the house''] by Jeff Haney, [[Las Vegas Sun]], November 13, 2003.</ref>\n;Dealer wins ties: The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player.  Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in \"blackjack-like\" games such as in some charity casinos.\n\n==Blackjack strategy==\n\n===Basic strategy===\nEach blackjack game has a ''basic strategy'', which is playing a hand of any total value against any dealer's up-card, which loses the least money to the house in the long term.\n\nAn example of basic strategy is shown in the table below, and includes the following parameters:<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\">{{cite web|title=4-Deck to 8-Deck Blackjack Strategy - Wizard of Odds|url=http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/|publisher=Wizard of Odds Consulting, Inc|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n* Four to eight decks\n* The dealer hits on a soft 17\n* A double is allowed after a split\n* Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For example, if the above game used the hit on soft 17 rule, common in [[Las Vegas Strip]] casinos, only 6 cells of the table would need to be changed: double on 11 ''vs.'' A, surrender 15 or 17 ''vs.'' A, double on A,7 ''vs.'' 2, double on A,8 ''vs.'' 6, surrender (if not allowed, then hit) on 8,8 ''vs.'' A. Also when playing basic strategy never take insurance or \"even money.\"<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/>\n\nEstimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.\n\nMost blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.\n\n===Composition-dependent strategy===\nBasic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:<ref name= wizard>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n* It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).\n* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.\n\nHowever, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.<ref name= wizard2>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Advantage play===\n{{Main|Advantage player}}\nBlackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:\n\n====Card counting====\n{{Main|Card counting}}\n\nDuring the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:\n* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.\n* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.\n\nA card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2\u20136, 0 points for 7\u20139 and \u22121 point for 10\u2013A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for \"balanced\" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.\n\nBlackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%\u20131% when players use basic strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table|title=Blackjack - Beating Bonuses|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref> Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.<ref name=\"TOB\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Peter |title=The theory of blackjack : the compleat card counter's guide to the casino game of 21 |date=March 1, 1999 |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=978-0929712130 ||edition=6th}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nCard counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.\n\nCard counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device,<ref name=\"TOB\" />{{rp|6-7}} but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.<ref>[[Edward O. Thorp|Thorp, Edward O.]] (1966) ''Beat The Dealer'', Vintage Books, a Division of Random House, {{ISBN|978-0-394-70310-7}}, pp 132\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|title=State Gambling Laws|website=www.gambling-law-us.com}}</ref>\n\n====Shuffle tracking====\n{{main|Shuffle tracking}}\nTechniques other than card counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by [[Edward O. Thorp]].<ref>Edward Thorp: ''A Favorable Strategy for Twenty-One'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 47, No. 1, 1961, pp. 110\u2013112, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/70615 JSTOR], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC285252/pdf/pnas00217-0125.pdf archive of PNAS].</ref> One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm|title=Blackjack in Color|work=Shuffle Tracking Counts}}</ref>\n\nArnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.<ref>''The Gambling Times Guide to Blackjack''; Gambling Times Incorporated, Hollywood, CA;  1984; Page 110; {{ISBN|0-89746-015-4}} Shuffle-Tracking An Easy Way to Start</ref><ref>''Break the Dealer''; by Jerry L. Patterson and Eddie Olsen; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam;  1986; {{ISBN|0-399-51233-0}} Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 6, Page 83</ref><ref>''Blackjack: A Winner's Handbook''; by Jerry L. Patterson; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; \u00a9 1990; {{ISBN|0-399-51598-4}}  Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 4, Page 51</ref>\n\n====Identifying concealed cards====\nThe player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by [[hole carding]] (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.\n\n==Side bets==\nMany blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Odds|work=Blackjack Side Bets|url=http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html}}</ref>\n*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (\"Lucky Lucky\")\n*Player initial hand is a pair (\"Perfect pairs\")\n*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (\"Royal match\")\n*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (\"21+3\")\n*Player initial hand totals 20 (\"Lucky Ladies\")\n*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (\"In Bet\")\n*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (\"Bust It!\")\n*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (\"Match the Dealer\")\n\nThe side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.\n\nThe house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Only a few side bets, like \"Lucky Ladies\", offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.\n\nIn team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.\n\n==Blackjack tournaments==\nBlackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, [[Elimination Blackjack]], drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.\n\n==Video blackjack==\nSome casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games deal each coup from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting much less effective.\n\n==Variants of the game==\nBlackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.\n\n*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to ''rescue'', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6\u20137\u20138 21s, 7\u20137\u20137 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name [[Pontoon (card game)|\"Pontoon\"]] (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game \"Pontoon\" which has substantially different rules).\n*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as \"Vegas Style\" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.\n*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's cards are exposed at the outset).\n*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.\n*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10\u20136 and 5\u201310, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10\u201310 and 6\u20135.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.\n*'''[[Super Fun 21]]''' allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, he automatically wins. Wins are paid 1:1.\n\nExamples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''French/German Blackjack''', called ''Vingt-et-un'' (French: Twenty-one) or \"Siebzehn und Vier\" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called \"Pontoon\", the name being probably a corruption of \"Vingt-et-un\".\n\n===TV show variations===\nBlackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.\n\n*'''''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''''' was a game show with [[Wink Martindale]] where couples answer questions to collect cards that could add up to 21.\n*'''''[[Catch 21]]''''' is a game show with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] from ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. On this show, three players answer questions to earn cards in order to win cash and ties are not allowed.\n*From 1980 to 2006, there was a blackjack-based [[List of The Price is Right pricing games|pricing game]] on ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', called '''Hit Me'''. In this game, six grocery products were used, and five of those products' prices were multiplied by various numbers from 2 to 10, but with the one remaining product having the exact price. In order to win a large prize, the contestant had to achieve a score of 21 (which was usually done by picking a product whose price was multiplied by ten and the one that was correctly priced), or beat the house with any score that did not exceed 21.\n\n==Blackjack Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}\n\nIn 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the \"Wonging\" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.\n\n== Blackjack in the arts ==\nNovels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were ''The Blackjack Hijack'' (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie [[Nowhere to Run (1978 film)|''Nowhere to Run'']], and [[Bringing Down the House (book)|''Bringing Down the House'']] (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as [[21 (2008 film)|''21'']]. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film ''[[The Last Casino]]''.\n\nIn ''The Hangover'', an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of ''[[Rain Man]]'' is that Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an autistic [[savant syndrome|savant]], is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film ''[[The Gambler (2014 film)|The Gambler]]'' we see Jim Bennett ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|{{PAGENAME}}}}\n* [[The Gambler (film series)]]\n* [[Glossary of blackjack terms]]\n* [[MIT Blackjack Team]]\n\n==Blackjack literature==\n* ''Beat the Dealer : A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'', [[Edward O.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYdJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false On page 11], Wollaston coins the term \"bicarbonate\":  \"The next question that occurs relates to the composition of this crystallized carbonate of potash, which I am induced to call bi-carbonate of potash, for the purpose of marking more decidedly the distinction between this salt and that which is commonly called a subcarbonate, and in order to refer at once to the double dose of carbonic acid contained in it.\"</ref>  The prefix \"bi\" in \"bicarbonate\" comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much [[carbonate]] ({{Chem|CO|3|2-}}) per sodium ion in [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and other bicarbonates than in [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and other carbonates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm|title=Classroom Resources - Argonne National Laboratory|author=|date=|website=www.newton.dep.anl.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226223438/http://newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}</ref> The name lives on as a [[trivial name]].\n\n==Chemical properties==\n\nThe bicarbonate ion (hydrogencarbonate ion) is an [[anion]] with the [[empirical formula]] {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} and a molecular mass of 61.01&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|daltons]]; it consists of one central carbon [[atom]] surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. It is [[isoelectronic]] with [[nitric acid]]&nbsp;{{chem|HNO|3}}. The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one [[formal charge]] and is an [[Amphoterism#Amphiprotic molecules|amphiprotic]] species which has both acidic and basic properties. It is both the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[carbonic acid]]&nbsp;{{chem|H|2|CO|3}}; and the [[conjugate acid]] of {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}}, the [[carbonate]] ion, as shown by these [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:\n\n:{{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} + H<sub>2</sub>O + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2  OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} + 2 H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.\n\nA bicarbonate salt forms when a [[cation|positively charged ion]] attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an [[ionic compound]]. Many bicarbonates are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[aqueous solution|water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]]; in particular, sodium bicarbonate contributes to [[total dissolved solids]], a common parameter for assessing [[water quality]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==Physiological role==\n[[File:Riassorbimento bicarbonati e respirazione cellulare.svg|450px|thumbnail|left|CO<sub>2</sub> produced as a waste product of the oxidation of sugars in the mitochondria reacts with water in a reaction catalyzed by [[carbonic anhydrase]] to form H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which is in equilibrium with the cation H<sup>+</sup> and anion HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. It is then carried to the lung, where the reverse reaction occurs and CO<sub>2</sub> gas is released. In the kidney (left), cells (green) lining the proximal tubule conserve bicarbonate by transporting it from the glomerular filtrate in the lumen (yellow) of the nephron back into the blood (red). The exact stoichiometry in the kidney is omitted for simplicity.]]{{clear left}}\nBicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|-}}) is [[alkaline]]{{Fact|date=July 2018}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}}, and a vital component of the [[pH]] [[Buffer solution|buffering system]]<ref name=\"veq\" /> of the human body (maintaining [[acid\u2013base homeostasis]]). 70\u201375% of CO<sub>2</sub> in the body is converted into [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which can quickly turn into bicarbonate.\n\nWith carbonic acid as the [[Reaction intermediate|central intermediate]] [[Chemical species|species]], bicarbonate \u2013 in conjunction with water, [[hydronium|hydrogen ions]], and [[carbon dioxide]] \u2013 forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium<ref name=\"veq\" /> required to provide prompt resistance to pH changes in both the acidic and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] directions. This is especially important for protecting [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[central nervous system]], where pH changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous (see [[acidosis]] or [[alkalosis]]).\n\nBicarbonate also serves much in the digestive system. It raises the internal pH of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. Bicarbonate also acts to regulate pH in the small intestine. It is released from the [[pancreas]] in response to the hormone [[secretin]] to neutralize the acidic [[chyme]] entering the duodenum from the stomach.<ref>Berne & Levy, ''Principles of Physiology''</ref>\n\n==Bicarbonate in the environment==\nBicarbonate is the dominant form of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in sea water,<ref>{{cite web|title=The chemistry of ocean acidification : OCB-OA|url=http://www.whoi.edu/OCB-OA/page.do?pid=112136|website=www.whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en-NZ|date=24 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519193604/http://www.whoi.edu/OCB-OA/page.do?pid=112136|archivedate=19 May 2017|df=}}</ref> and in most fresh waters. As such it is an important sink in the [[carbon cycle]].\n\nIn freshwater ecology, strong [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous [[oxygen]] into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. These shift the pH upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as [[ammonia]] toxic. In darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in pH.\n\n==Other uses==\nThe most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is [[sodium bicarbonate]], NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, which is commonly known as [[baking soda]]. When heated or exposed to an [[acid]] such as [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]), sodium bicarbonate releases [[carbon dioxide]]. This is used as a [[leavening agent]] in [[baking]].\n\nThe flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].\n\n[[Ammonium bicarbonate]] is used in [[digestive biscuit]] manufacture.\n\n==Diagnostics==\nIn [[diagnostic medicine]], the [[blood value]] of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of [[acid\u2013base physiology]] in the body. It is measured, along with [[carbon dioxide]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], and [[sodium]], to assess [[electrolyte]] levels in an [[electrolyte panel]] test (which has [[Current Procedural Terminology]], CPT, code 80051).\n\nThe parameter ''standard bicarbonate concentration'' (SBC<sub>e</sub>) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a [[PaCO2|P<sub>a</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>]] of {{convert|40|mmHg|kPa|2|abbr=on}}, full oxygen saturation and 36&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>[http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm Acid Base Balance (page 3)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613020114/http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm |date=2002-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reference ranges for blood tests - by molarity.png|thumb|550px|center|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]], comparing blood content of bicarbonate (shown in blue at right) with other constituents.]]\n\n== Bicarbonate compounds ==\n\n* [[Sodium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Potassium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Caesium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Magnesium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Calcium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Ammonium bicarbonate]]\n* [[Carbonic acid]]\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Carbon dioxide]]\n* [[Carbonate]]\n* [[Carbonic anhydrase]]\n* [[Hard water]]\n* [[Arterial blood gas]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{MeshName|Bicarbonates}}\n\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n{{Clinical biochemistry blood tests}}\n{{carbon compounds}}\n\n[[Category:Amphoteric compounds]]\n[[Category:Anions]]\n[[Category:Bicarbonates| ]]", "sha1": "syaw98m0ldzuqlm68dga3czbdm533ai"}}, {"title": "Bernie Federko", "ns": "0", "id": "3984", "revision": {"id": "864824724", "parentid": "850688667", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T18:24:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Djsasso", "id": "149061"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* top */cleanup", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox ice hockey player\n| image = Bernie Federko 1981.JPG\n| image_size = \n| caption = Federko in 1981\n| position = [[Centre (ice hockey)|Centre]]\n| played_for = [[St. Louis Blues]]<br />[[Detroit Red Wings]]\n| shoots = Left\n| draft = 7th overall\n| draft_year = 1976\n| draft_team = [[St. Louis Blues]]\n| wha_draft = 6th overall\n| wha_draft_year = 1976\n| wha_draft_team = [[Edmonton Oilers]]\n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 0\n| weight_lb = 195\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|mf=yes|1956|5|12}}\n| birth_place = [[Foam Lake, Saskatchewan|Foam Lake]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada\n| career_start = 1976\n| career_end = 1990\n| halloffame = 2002\n}}\n'''Bernard Allan''' \"'''Bernie'''\" '''Federko''' (born May 12, 1956) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired professional [[ice hockey]] [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ancestry who played fourteen seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] from [[1976\u201377 NHL season|1976]] through [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1990]].\n\n==Playing career==\nFederko began playing hockey at a young age in his home town of [[Foam Lake, Saskatchewan]]. He was captain of the 1971 Bantam provincial champions. He also played Senior hockey with the local [[Foam Lake Flyers]] of the Fishing Lake Hockey League, winning the league scoring title as a bantam-aged player. Federko continued his career with the [[Saskatoon Blades]] of the [[Western Hockey League|WHL]] where he set and still holds the team record for assists. He played three seasons with the Blades, and in his final year with the club he led the league in assists and points in both the regular season ''and'' playoffs. As a reward, Federko was drafted 7th overall by the [[St. Louis Blues]] in the [[1976 NHL Amateur Draft]]. He started the next season with the [[Kansas City Blues (ice hockey)|Kansas City Blues]] of the [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey League]] and was leading the league in points when he was called up mid-season to play 31 games with St. Louis. He scored three [[hat trick]]s in those 31 games. In the [[1978\u201379 NHL season]], Federko developed into a bona fide star, as he scored 95 points.\n\nFederko scored 100 points in a season four times, and was a consistent and underrated performer for the Blues. Federko scored at least 90 points in seven of the eight seasons between 1978 and 1986, and became the first player in NHL history to record at least 50 assists in 10 consecutive seasons. However, in an era when [[Wayne Gretzky]] was scoring 200 points a season, Federko never got the attention many felt he deserved. In 1986, in a poll conducted by GOAL magazine, he was named the most overlooked talent in hockey. His [[General Manager]] [[Ron Caron]] said he was \"A great playmaker. He makes the average or above average player look like a star at times. He's such an unselfish player.\"\n\nOn March 19, 1988, Federko became the 22nd NHL player to record 1000 career points. After a poor season for Federko in [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1988\u201389]], he was traded to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] with [[Tony McKegney]] for future Blues star [[Adam Oates]], and [[Paul MacLean (ice hockey)|Paul MacLean]]. In Detroit, Federko re-united with former Blues head coach [[Jacques Demers]], but he had to play behind [[Steve Yzerman]] and did not get his desired ice time.

of [[New York (state)|New York]]. {{As of|July 2016}}, the population was 256,902. The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], forming part of the bi-national [[Buffalo Niagara Region]].\n\nThe Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Iroquois]] tribe and later by French settlers. The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration, the construction of the [[Erie Canal]] and [[Rail transportation in the United States|rail transportation]], and its close proximity to [[Lake Erie]]. This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the [[Midwestern United States]] while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries that dominated the city's economy in the 20th century. Since the city's economy relied heavily on manufacturing, [[deindustrialization]] in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population. While some manufacturing activity remains, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare, research and higher education, which emerged following the [[Great Recession]].\n\nBuffalo is on the eastern shore of [[Lake Erie]], at the head of the [[Niagara River]], 16 miles south of [[Niagara Falls]].

The team competes in the [[AFC East]] division. Since the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in 1970, the Bills have won the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] conference championship four consecutive times (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993), resulting in four lost [[Super Bowl]]s ([[Super Bowl XXV]], [[Super Bowl XXVI]], [[Super Bowl XXVII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]); they were the only NFL team without a playoff appearance in the 21st century from 2011 until 2017, having missed the playoffs each season since 2000.\n\nThe Sabres, established in 1970, played in [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] until 1996, when [[Marine Midland Arena]], now KeyBank Center opened.

The team has won one [[Presidents' Trophy]] (2006-2007) and three conference championships (1974-1975, 1979-1980 and 1998-1999). However, like the Bills, the Sabres don't have a league championship, having lost the 1975 Stanley Cup to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and the 1999 Stanley Cup to the [[Dallas Stars]]. Since 2014, both the Bills and Sabres have been owned by [[Terrence Pegula]], a key investor in Buffalo's revitalization efforts.\n\nThe [[Buffalo Braves]] played at the [[National Basketball Association]] from 1970 to 1978, with their home games held at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The team struggled financially, so it was relocated to California and became the [[San Diego Clippers]].\n\nBuffalo is also home to several minor sports teams, including the [[Buffalo Bisons]] ([[baseball]]; an affiliate of the MLB's [[Toronto Blue Jays]] since 2014), [[FC Buffalo]] ([[Association football|soccer]]) as well as a professional women's team, the [[Buffalo Beauts]] ([[hockey]]). The [[Buffalo Bandits]] [[Box lacrosse|indoor lacrosse]] team was established in 1992 and played their home games in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium until 1996 when they followed the Sabres to Marine Midland Arena. They have won eight division championships and four league championships (1991-1992, 1992-1993, 1995-1996 and 2007-2008).

The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was [[Chester A. Kowal]] in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiances several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms.\n\nGriffin's successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. However, in 2005, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%\u201327%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform. In 2013, the Conservative Party endorsed Brown for a third term because of his pledge to cut taxes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and on the edge of bankruptcy. At [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]]'s urging, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Mayor Tony Masiello began conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government the following year, but they came to nought.\n\nThe offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are next to the Black Rock Lock in the Erie Canal's Black Rock channel.

As the first [[United States Ambassador to France]], he exemplified the emerging American nation.<ref>H.W. Brands, ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin'' (2000)</ref> Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In the words of historian [[Henry Steele Commager]], \"In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of [[Puritanism]] without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.\"<ref>Isaacson 2003, p. 491</ref> To [[Walter Isaacson]], this makes Franklin \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.\"<ref>Walter Isaacson, ''Benjamin Franklin'' (2003), p. 492</ref>\n\nFranklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette]]'' at the age of 23.<ref>H.W. Brands. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B2bPCEbMAvwC&pg=PA390 The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin]''. (2010). p. 390.</ref> He became wealthy publishing this and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', which he authored under the [[pseudonym]] \"Richard Saunders\". After 1767, he was associated with the ''[[Pennsylvania Chronicle]]'', a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of British policies.\n\nHe pioneered and was first president of [[Academy and College of Philadelphia]] which opened in 1751 and later became the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He organized and was the first secretary of the [[American Philosophical Society]] and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] repeal the unpopular [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive [[France\u2013United States relations|Franco-American relations]]. His efforts proved vital for the [[American Revolution]] in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.\n\nHe was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the [[American Revolution|revolution]], he became the first [[United States Postmaster General]]. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|governor of Pennsylvania]]. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against [[slavery]] from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]].\n\nHis colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on [[Franklin half dollar|coinage]] and the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]], [[USS Benjamin Franklin (SSBN-640)|warships]], and [[List of places named for Benjamin Franklin|the names of many towns]], counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless [[Benjamin Franklin in popular culture|cultural references]].\n\n==Ancestry==\n\n===Maternal===\nBenjamin's mother, Abiah Folger, was born in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], on August 15, 1667, to [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]], a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, [[Mary Morrell Folger]], a former [[indentured servant]].\nShe came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to [[Massachusetts]] for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]], when [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635.\n\nHer father was \"the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.\"<ref>Isaacson 2003, p. 14</ref> As [[court clerk|clerk of the court]], he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy [[William Penn|Penn]] family that owned the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]].\n\n===Paternal===\nBenjamin Franklin's father, [[Josiah Franklin]], was a [[tallow]] chandler, a soap-maker and a candle-maker. Josiah was born at [[Ecton, Northamptonshire]], England on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith-farmer, and Jane White.\n\nBenjamin's father and all four of his grandparents were born in [[England]].\n\n===Family===\nJosiah had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated with her to [[Boston]] in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. Following her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the [[Old South Meeting House]] by [[Samuel Willard]].

These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1 and March 25, an advance of one year.

He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]].\n\nWhen denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of \"[[Silence Dogood]]\", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood (quoting ''[[Cato's Letters]]'') proclaim: \"Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech.\"<ref>Isaacson, (2003) p. 32</ref> Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a [[fugitive from justice|fugitive]].<ref name=\"vandoren\">Carl Van Doren, ''Benjamin Franklin''.

When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith]] to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.<ref name=\"vandoren\"/>\n\n===Junto and library===\n\nIn 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of \"like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.\" The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.<ref>On the importance of the Junto see Michael D. Mumford, \"Social innovation: ten cases from Benjamin Franklin.\" ''Creativity research journal'' (2002) 14#2 pp. 253\u201366.</ref> The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.<ref>David Waldstreicher, ed., '' A Companion to Benjamin Franklin'' (2011) p. 30</ref><ref>J.

The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:\n\n{{quote|A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library: an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1602397064}}</ref>}}\n\nThis did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, [[Louis Timothee]]. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and [[Library#Research library|research library]].<ref>Margaret Barton Korty, \"Benjamin Franklin and eighteenth-century American libraries.\" ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1965): 1\u201383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006049 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Newspaperman===\nUpon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with [[Hugh Meredith]]; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'<ref name=\"vandoren\"/>\n\n[[File:Franklin the printer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Benjamin Franklin (center) at work on a [[printing press]]. Reproduction of a Charles Mills painting by the [[Detroit Publishing Company]].]]\n\nIn 1732, Ben Franklin published the first [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in America \u2013 ''Die Philadelphische Zeitung'' \u2013 although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa071299.htm|title=German Newspapers in the US and Canada|publisher=|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref> Franklin printed Moravian religious books in German. Franklin often visited [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] staying at the [[Moravian Sun Inn]].<ref>John B. Frantz, \"Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans.\" ''Pennsylvania History'' (1998): 21\u201334. [https://journals.psu.edu/index.php/phj/article/viewFile/25467/25236 online]</ref> In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies, he called the [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Germans]] \"Palatine Boors\" who could never acquire the \"Complexion\" of the English settlers and referred to \"Blacks and Tawneys\" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.<ref>Philip. Gleason, \"Trouble in the Colonial Melting Pot.\" ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2000) 20#1 pp. 3\u201317.</ref>\n\nFranklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. In ''Benjamin Franklin's Journalism'', Ralph Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60\u201372 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of Arms of Benjamin Franklin]]\n\nWhen Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two \"wretched little\" news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''The American Weekly Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/225/index.html#7 Elizabeth Christine Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704\u20131775'' (1917)] </ref> This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from ''Chambers's Universal Dictionary''. Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor'' and made it ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''. The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. {{anchor|The Busy-Body}}{{anchor|The Busybody}}The series of essays called \"The Busy-Body\", which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general [[Joseph Addison|Addisonian]] form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been in the ''Tatler''. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the \"sowre Philosopher\", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, [[Samuel Keimer]]. <ref>Cook, ''Colonial and Revolutionary Literature; Early National Literature, Part I. Colonial Newspapers and Magazines, 1704\u20131775'' (1917)]</ref>\n\nThe ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette.'' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nFranklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue.<ref>Ralph Frasca, ''Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network: Disseminating Virtue in Early America'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0826216144}}</ref> He began in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1731.

Daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read}}\n\nAt age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old [[Deborah Read]] while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith's]] request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.<ref name=\"vandoren\"/>\n\nWhile Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to [[Barbados]] with her [[dowry]], leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of [[bigamy]] laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.\n\nFranklin established a [[common-law marriage]] with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730. They took in Franklin's recently acknowledged young illegitimate son [[William Franklin|William]] and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, [[Francis Folger Franklin]], was born in October 1732 and died of [[smallpox]] in 1736. Their daughter, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah \"Sally\" Franklin]], was born in 1743 and grew up to marry [[Richard Bache]], have seven children, and look after her father in his old age.\n\nDeborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, and another possible reason why they spent so much time apart is that he may have blamed her for preventing their son Francis from being vaccinated against the disease that subsequently killed him.<ref>Coss, Stephen.

His mother's identity is unknown.<ref>Skemp SL. ''William Franklin: Son of a Patriot, Servant of a King'', Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0195057457}}, p. 4</ref> He was educated in Philadelphia. Beginning at about age 30, William studied law in London in the early 1760s. He fathered an illegitimate son, [[William Temple Franklin]], born February 22, 1762. The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. Later in 1762, William married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a [[plantation|planter]] from [[Barbados]]. After William passed the bar, his father helped him gain an appointment in 1763 as the last [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|Royal Governor]] of New Jersey.\n\nA [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], William and his father eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War. The elder Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in [[Perth Amboy]] at the [[Proprietary House]] and imprisoned for a time. The younger Franklin went to New York in 1782, which was still occupied by British troops. He became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists\u2014a quasi-military organization, headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into [[New Jersey]], southern [[Connecticut]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] counties north of the city.<ref>Fleming, Thomas, ''The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival'', (Collins, New York, 2007) p. 30</ref> When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England.

Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. \"Poor Richard's Proverbs\", adages from this almanac, such as \"A penny saved is twopence dear\" (often misquoted as \"A penny saved is a penny earned\") and \"Fish and visitors stink in three days\", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared.

Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of [[electric shock]].{{sfn|Van Doren|1938|p=159}} Others, such as Prof. [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] in [[Russia]], were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following Franklin's experiment.\n\nIn his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]]. Franklin did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous.<ref>[http://www.mos.org/sln/toe/kite.html ''Franklin's Kite''], Museum of Science, Boston.</ref> Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:\n\n{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leyden jar]], may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated.<ref>Wolf, A., ''History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century''.

While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]]? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall.\n\nFranklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a [[Nantucket]] whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0}}. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the [[Gulf Stream]], by which it is still known today.\n\nFranklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole oceanographer]] and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris in 1980.<ref>Philip L.

In the 18th century [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] was held to be true; only after [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young's]] well-known [[slit experiment]] in 1803 were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens's theory.<ref>Jogn Gribbin, \"In search of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\", Black Swan, p. 12</ref>\n\n===Meteorology===\nOn October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Franklin was said to have noted that the [[prevailing winds]] were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced [[meteorology]].<ref>Heidorn, Keith C. Heidorn, PhD.

To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in [[Cambridge]], England, Franklin and fellow scientist [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]] experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury [[thermometer]] with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and using [[bellows]] to evaporate the ether.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |title=The Writings of Benjamin Franklin: London, 1757\u20131775 |publisher=Historycarper.com |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> With each subsequent [[evaporation]], the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching {{convert|7|F}}. Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at {{convert|65|F}}.

In the same year, he printed a new currency for [[New Jersey]] based on innovative anti-[[counterfeit]]ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for [[Banknote|paper money]], publishing ''A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency'' in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped [[deflation]] without causing excessive inflation.

This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the [[Board of Trade]] in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad [[Albany Plan|Plan of Union]] for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].\n\nIn 1756, Franklin received an honorary [[master of arts]] degree from the [[College of William and Mary]].<ref>{{cite book |last=College of William and Mary |first=College of William and Mary |date=1874 |title=The History of the College of William and Mary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfaiLj00yFYC&pg=PA48 |location=Richmond, VA |publisher=J.

He used [[Tun Tavern]] as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected \"Colonel\" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.\n\n===Decades in London===\nFrom the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London. Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people.\n\nIn 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the [[Penn family]], the [[proprietary colony|proprietors of the colony]]. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission.\n\n[[File:US-Colonial (PA-115)-Pennsylvania-18 Jun 1764.jpg|thumb|left|Pennsylvania colonial currency printed by Franklin in 1764]]\n\nAt this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the \"anti-proprietary party\" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.<ref name=\"ANB\">J. A. Leo Lematy, \"Franklin, Benjamin\". ''[[American National Biography]] Online'', February 2000.</ref>\n\nIn London, Franklin opposed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]]. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.<ref>Peter Charles Hoffer, ''Benjamin Franklin Explains the Stamp Act Protests to Parliament, 1766'' (2015)</ref>\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1767.jpg|thumb|upright|Franklin in London, 1767, wearing a blue suit with elaborate gold braid and buttons, a far cry from the simple dress he affected at the [[Court (royal)|French court]] in later years.

He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]] also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.<ref name=\"ANB\" />\n\nFranklin lodged in a house in Craven Street, just off [[Strand, London|The Strand]] in [[central London]]. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum in 2006.\n\nWhilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a [[gentleman's club]] (which he called \"the honest Whigs\"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]], and [[Andrew Kippis]].<ref>Duncan Wu, ''William Hazlitt (1737-1820), the Priestley Circle, and \"The Theological Repository:\" A Brief Survey and Bibliography'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 56, No. 227 (Nov., 2005), pp. 758\u2013766, at p. 762. Published by: Oxford University Press {{jstor|3661246}}</ref>\n\nIn 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|Covent Garden coffee shops]]. After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.\n\nThe study of [[natural philosophy]] (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]; on occasion he visited them.\n\nIn 1759, the [[University of St Andrews]] awarded Franklin an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in recognition of his accomplishments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/people-franklin-resume.htm|title=Benjamin Franklin's Resume \u2013 Independence National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Oxford University]] in 1762.

This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own.

He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Prussia\u2013United States)|treaty of friendship]] between Prussia and America in 1785.\n\nIn September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, [[John Pringle (physician)|Sir John Pringle]].

Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France\u2014as many as Britain itself sent\u2014and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the [[French and Indian War]] alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=James A.

Franklin helped to organize a local [[militia]] to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse.

A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in what would later become Canada, at Halifax, on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] and oversaw areas south of [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]].

Franklin's writings on [[virtue]] were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work ''Portrait of American Culture''. [[Max Weber]] considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of [[capitalism]].<ref>Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and the \"Spirit of Capitalism\"'', (Penguin Books, 2002), translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C.

[[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: \"The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic. The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them. The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] thought him half a Presbyterian, and the [[Quakers|Friends]] believed him a wet Quaker.\" Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, \"he was a true champion of generic religion.\" In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, \"When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.\"<ref>Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153\u201354</ref>\n\nIn 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:\n\n{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble.

The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.<ref>\"[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]\" (July 2003).

His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:\n\n# \"[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\"\n# \"[[Silence]]. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\"\n# \"[[Order (virtue)|Order]]. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\"\n# \"Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\"\n# \"[[Frugality]]. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\"\n# \"[[Industry]]. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\"\n# \"[[Sincerity]]. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\"\n# \"[[Justice]]. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\"\n# \"[[Moderation]]. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\"\n# \"[[Cleanliness]]. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.\"\n# \"[[Tranquility]]. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\"\n# \"[[Chastity]]. Rarely use [[Human sexuality|venery]] but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\"\n# \"[[Humility]]. Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]].\"\n\nFranklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week \"leaving all others to their ordinary chance.\" While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, \"I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.\"<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm ''Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin page 38 forward''] by Benjamin Franklin</ref>\n\n==Slavery==\nFranklin owned as many as seven slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who had run off to join the [[British Army]] during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a \"cautious abolitionist\" and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. Franklin took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King, and King left his service there in 1756: by 1758 he was working for \"a lady in Suffolk\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|publisher = Simon & Schuster|year = 2003|isbn = |location = New York|chapter = Chapter Eight}}</ref> Whether Franklin could have compelled King's return is open to doubt in the light of earlier English [[Common Law]] decisions and [[Slavery at common law#Shanley v Harvey|the subsequent case of Shanley v Harvey]], but in fact he did not do so.\n\nAfter returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the [[international slave trade]]. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the [[1787 Constitutional Convention]].<ref>Waldstreicher, David. \"Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the Founders: On the dangers of reading backwards.\" Common-place.org. 04, no. 4 (July 2004). http://common-place.org/book/benjamin-franklin-slavery-and-the-founders-on-the-dangers-of-reading-backwards/</ref> Franklin tended to take both sides of the issue of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.<ref>Hoffer (2011), pp. 30\u201331</ref><ref>Waldstreicher (2004), pp. xii, xiii</ref>\n\nIn his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:\n\n* ''[[s:An Address to the Public|An Address to the Public]]'' (1789)\n* ''[[s:A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks|A Plan for Improving the Condition of the Free Blacks]]'' (1789)\n* ''Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade'' (1790)<ref>Myra Jehlen, Michael Warner, editors, ''The English Literatures of America, 1500\u20131800'', Psychology Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAYDAZmrKkgC&pg=PA891 p. 891] 1997, {{ISBN|0415919037}}</ref>\n\nIn 1790, [[Quakers]] from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress.

His death is described in the book ''The Life of Benjamin Franklin'', quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.<ref>Sparks, pp. 529\u201330.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nApproximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:\n\n<blockquote>The Body of B.

''[[The Times]]'' reported on February 11, 1998:\n\n<blockquote>Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: \"I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest.</blockquote>\n\nThe Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by [[William Hewson (surgeon)|William Hewson]], who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.<ref>[http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/news/pdf/Issue2.pdf ''The Craven Street Gazette''] ([[PDF]]), Newsletter of the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998</ref>\n\n===Bequest===\nFranklin [[bequest|bequeathed]] \u00a31,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $112,000 in 2011 dollars<ref>[http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php Measuring Worth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080025/http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php |date=May 23, 2013 }} Select $4,400 and 1790 and 2011 in online calculator</ref>) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" called \"Fortunate Richard\". The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects.<ref>Richard Price.

When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a [[Vocational school|trade school]] that became the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute of Boston]], and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |title=Excerpt from Philadelphia Inquirer article by Clark De Leon |publisher=Mathsci.appstate.edu |date=February 7, 1993 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510050913/http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/class/1010/wc/finance/franklin1.html |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php |title=History of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology |publisher=Bfit.edu |accessdate=September 21, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731130624/http://www.bfit.edu/aboutus/history.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Franklin on U.S. postage===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1861 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|<center>Issue of 1861</center>]]\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin2 1895 Issue-1c.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|<center>Issue of 1895</center>]]\nBenjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times.

"text": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[functional analysis]], a '''Banach space''' (pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8banax|}}) is a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[normed vector space]]. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] that allows the computation of [[Norm (mathematics)|vector length]] and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a [[Cauchy sequence]] of vectors always converges to a well defined [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] that is within the space.\n\nBanach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician [[Stefan Banach]], who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920\u20131922 along with [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Eduard Helly]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1987|loc=V.86}}<!--From French edition. Please check the \"Historical Note\" in the English edition.--></ref> Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of [[function space]]s by [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet|Fr\u00e9chet]], and [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] earlier in the century. Banach spaces play a central role in functional analysis. In other areas of [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], the spaces under study are often Banach spaces.\n\n== Definition ==\nA Banach space is a [[vector space]] {{mvar|X}} over the field {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers, or over the field {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers, which is equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_X</math> and which is [[complete metric space|complete]] with respect to that norm, that is to say, for every [[Cauchy sequence]] {{math|{''x<sub>n</sub>''} }} in {{mvar|X}}, there exists an element {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} such that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}x_n=x,</math>\n\nor equivalently:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left \\|x_n - x \\right \\|_X = 0.</math>\n\nThe vector space structure allows one to relate the behavior of Cauchy sequences to that of converging [[Series (mathematics)#Generalizations|series of vectors]]. A normed space {{mvar|X}} is a Banach space if and only if each [[Series (mathematics)|absolutely convergent]] series in {{mvar|X}} converges,<ref>see Theorem&nbsp;1.3.9, p.&nbsp;20 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.</ref>\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\|v_n\\|_X < \\infty \\quad \\text{implies that} \\quad \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} v_n\\ \\ \\text{converges in} \\ \\ X.</math>\n\nCompleteness of a normed space is preserved if the given norm is replaced by an [[Norm (mathematics)#Definition|equivalent]] one.\n\nAll norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent. Every finite-dimensional normed space over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}} is a Banach space.<ref>see Corollary&nbsp;1.4.18, p.&nbsp;32 in {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}.</ref>\n\n== General theory ==\n\n=== Linear operators, isomorphisms ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Operator]] -->\n{{main|Bounded operator}}\nIf {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are normed spaces over the same [[ground field]] {{math|'''K'''}}, the set of all [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear transformation|{{math|'''K'''}}-linear maps]] {{math|''T'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is denoted by {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}}. In infinite-dimensional spaces, not all linear maps are continuous. A linear mapping from a normed space {{mvar|X}} to another normed space is continuous if and only if it is [[bounded operator|bounded]] on the closed [[Unit sphere|unit ball]] of {{mvar|X}}. Thus, the vector space {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}} can be given the [[operator norm]]\n\n:<math>\\|T\\| = \\sup \\left \\{\\|Tx\\|_Y \\mid x\\in X,\\ \\|x\\|_X\\le 1 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nFor {{mvar|Y}} a Banach space, the space {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}} is a Banach space with respect to this norm.\n\nIf {{mvar|X}} is a Banach space, the space {{math|''B''(''X'') {{=}} ''B''(''X'', ''X'')}} forms a unital [[Banach algebra]]; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps.\n\nIf {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are normed spaces, they are '''isomorphic normed spaces''' if there exists a linear bijection {{math|''T'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} such that {{mvar|T}} and its inverse {{math|''T''<sup>&thinsp;\u22121</sup>}} are continuous. If one of the two spaces {{mvar|X}} or {{mvar|Y}} is complete (or [[Reflexive space|reflexive]], [[Separable space|separable]], etc.) then so is the other space. Two normed spaces {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are '''isometrically isomorphic''' if in addition, {{mvar|T}} is an [[isometry]], i.e., {{math|{{!!}}''T''(''x''){{!!}} {{=}} {{!!}}''x''{{!!}}}} for every {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}. The [[Banach\u2013Mazur distance]] {{math|''d''(''X'', ''Y'')}} between two isomorphic but not isometric spaces {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} gives a measure of how much the two spaces {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} differ.\n\n=== Basic notions ===\nEvery normed space {{mvar|X}} can be isometrically embedded in a Banach space. More precisely, for every normed space {{mvar|X}}, there exist a Banach space {{mvar|Y}} and a mapping {{math|''T'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} such that T is an [[Isometry|isometric mapping]] and {{math|''T''(''X'')}} is dense in {{mvar|Y}}. If {{mvar|Z}} is another Banach space such that there is an isometric isomorphism from {{mvar|X}} onto a dense subset of {{mvar|Z}}, then {{mvar|Z}} is isometrically isomorphic to {{mvar|Y}}.\n\nThis Banach space {{mvar|Y}} is the [[Complete metric space#Completion|'''completion''']] of the normed space {{mvar|X}}. The underlying metric space for {{mvar|Y}} is the same as the metric completion of {{mvar|X}}, with the vector space operations extended from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}. The completion of {{mvar|X}} is often denoted by <math>\\widehat X</math>.\n\nThe cartesian product {{math|''X'' \u00d7 ''Y''}} of two normed spaces is not canonically equipped with a norm. However, several equivalent norms are commonly used,<ref>see {{harvtxt|Banach|1932}}, p.&nbsp;182.</ref> such as\n\n:<math> \\|(x, y)\\|_1 = \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|, \\qquad \\|(x, y)\\|_\\infty = \\max (\\|x\\|, \\|y\\|) </math>\n\nand give rise to isomorphic normed spaces. In this sense, the product {{math|''X'' \u00d7 ''Y''}} (or the direct sum {{math|''X'' \u2295 ''Y''}}) is complete if and only if the two factors are complete.\n\nIf {{mvar|M}} is a [[closed set|closed]] [[linear subspace]] of a normed space {{mvar|X}}, there is a natural norm on the '''quotient space''' {{math|''X''\u2009/\u2009''M''}},\n\n:<math> \\| x + M\\| = \\inf\\limits_{m \\in M} \\|x+m\\|. </math>\n\nThe quotient {{math|''X''\u2009/\u2009''M''}} is a Banach space when {{mvar|X}} is complete.<ref name=\"Caro17\">see pp.&nbsp;17\u201319 in {{harvtxt|Carothers|2005}}.</ref> The '''quotient map''' from {{mvar|X}} onto {{math|''X''\u2009/\u2009''M''}}, sending {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} to its class {{math|''x'' + ''M''}}, is linear, onto and has norm {{math|1}}, except when {{math|''M'' {{=}} ''X''}}, in which case the quotient is the null space.\n\nThe closed linear subspace {{mvar|M}} of {{mvar|X}} is said to be a '''complemented subspace''' of {{mvar|X}} if {{mvar|M}} is the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of a bounded linear [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] {{mvar|P}} from {{mvar|X}} onto {{mvar|M}}. In this case, the space {{mvar|X}} is isomorphic to the direct sum of {{mvar|M}} and {{math|Ker(''P'')}}, the kernel of the projection {{mvar|P}}.\n\nSuppose that {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are Banach spaces and that {{math|''T'' \u2208 ''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}}. There exists a '''canonical factorization''' of {{mvar|T}} as<ref name=\"Caro17\" />\n\n:<math> T = T_1 \\circ \\pi, \\ \\ \\ T : X \\ \\overset{\\pi}{\\longrightarrow}\\ X / \\operatorname{Ker}(T) \\ \\overset{T_1}{\\longrightarrow} \\ Y </math>\n\nwhere the first map {{mvar|\u03c0}} is the quotient map, and the second map {{math|''T''<sub>1</sub>}} sends every class {{math|''x'' + Ker(''T'')}} in the quotient to the image {{math|''T''(''x'')}} in {{mvar|Y}}. This is well defined because all elements in the same class have the same image. The mapping {{math|''T''<sub>1</sub>}} is a linear bijection from {{math|''X''\u2009/\u2009Ker(''T'')}} onto the range {{math|''T''(''X'')}}, whose inverse need not be bounded.\n\n=== Classical spaces ===\nBasic examples<ref>see {{harvtxt|Banach|1932}}, pp.&nbsp;11-12.</ref> of Banach spaces include: the [[Lp space|{{math|''L<sup>p</sup>''}} spaces]] and their special cases, the [[sequence space (mathematics)|sequence spaces]] {{math|\u2113<sup>''p''</sup>}} that consist of scalar sequences indexed by [[Natural number|{{math|'''N'''}}]]; among them, the space {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}} of [[Absolute convergence|absolutely summable]] sequences and the space {{math|\u2113<sup>2</sup>}} of square summable sequences; the space {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} of sequences tending to zero and the space {{math|\u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>}} of bounded sequences; the space {{math|''C''(''K'')}} of continuous scalar functions on a compact Hausdorff space {{mvar|K}}, equipped with the max norm,\n\n:<math> \\|f\\|_{C(K)} = \\max \\{ |f(x)| : x \\in K \\}, \\quad f \\in C(K). </math>\n\nAccording to the [[Banach\u2013Mazur theorem]], every Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of some {{math|''C''(''K'')}}.<ref>see {{harvtxt|Banach|1932}}, Th.&nbsp;9 p.&nbsp;185.</ref> For every separable Banach space {{mvar|X}}, there is a closed subspace {{mvar|M}} of {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}} such that {{math|''X'' \u2245 \u2113<sup>1</sup>/''M''}}.<ref>see Theorem&nbsp;6.1, p.&nbsp;55 in {{harvtxt|Carothers|2005}}</ref>\n\nAny [[Hilbert space]] serves as an example of a Banach space. A Hilbert space {{mvar|H}} on {{math|'''K''' {{=}} '''R''', '''C'''}} is complete for a norm of the form\n\n:<math>\\|x\\|_H = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle : H \\times H \\to \\mathbf{K}</math>\n\nis the [[Inner product space|inner product]], linear in its first argument that satisfies the following:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\forall x, y \\in H: \\quad \\langle y, x \\rangle &= \\overline{\\langle x, y \\rangle}, \\\\\n\\forall x \\in H: \\quad \\langle x, x \\rangle &\\ge 0, \\\\\n\\langle x,x \\rangle = 0 \\Leftrightarrow x &= 0.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor example, the space {{math|''L''<sup>2</sup>}} is a Hilbert space.\n\nThe [[Hardy space]]s, the [[Sobolev space]]s are examples of Banach spaces that are related to {{math|''L<sup>p</sup>''}} spaces and have additional structure. They are important in different branches of analysis, [[Harmonic analysis]] and [[Partial differential equation]]s among others.\n\n===Banach algebras===\nA '''[[Banach algebra]]''' is a Banach space {{mvar|A}} over {{math|'''K''' {{=}} '''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, together with a structure of [[Algebra over a field|algebra over {{math|'''K'''}}]], such that the product map ''A'' \u00d7 ''A'' \u220b {{math|(''a'', ''b'') \u21a6 ''ab'' \u2208 ''A''}} is continuous. An equivalent norm on {{mvar|A}} can be found so that {{math|{{!!}}''ab''{{!!}} \u2264 {{!!}}''a''{{!!}}&thinsp;{{!!}}''b''{{!!}}}} for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u2208 ''A''}}.\n\n====Examples====\n* The Banach space {{math|''C''(''K'')}}, with the pointwise product, is a Banach algebra.\n* The [[disk algebra]] {{math|''A''('''D''')}} consists of functions [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in the open unit disk {{math|'''D''' \u2282 '''C'''}} and continuous on its [[Closure (topology)|closure]]: {{math|{{overline|'''D'''}}}}. Equipped with the max norm on {{math|{{overline|'''D'''}}}}, the disk algebra {{math|''A''('''D''')}} is a closed subalgebra of {{math|''C''({{overline|'''D'''}})}}.\n* The [[Wiener algebra]] {{math|''A''('''T''')}} is the algebra of functions on the unit circle {{math|'''T'''}} with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Via the map associating a function on {{math|'''T'''}} to the sequence of its Fourier coefficients, this algebra is isomorphic to the Banach algebra {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>('''Z''')}}, where the product is the [[convolution#Discrete convolution|convolution]] of sequences.\n* For every Banach space {{mvar|X}}, the space {{math|''B''(''X'')}} of bounded linear operators on {{mvar|X}}, with the composition of maps as product, is a Banach algebra.\n* A [[C*-algebra]] is a complex Banach algebra {{mvar|A}} with an [[antilinear map|antilinear]] [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} such that {{math|{{!!}}''a''<sup>\u2217</sup>''a''{{!!}} {{=}} {{!!}}''a''{{!!}}<sup>2</sup>}}. The space {{math|''B''(''H'')}} of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space {{mvar|H}} is a fundamental example of C*-algebra. The [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem]] states that every C*-algebra is isometrically isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra of some {{math|''B''(''H'')}}. The space {{math|''C''(''K'')}} of complex continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space {{mvar|K}} is an example of commutative C*-algebra, where the involution associates to every function {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}} its [[complex conjugate]] {{math|{{overline|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}}}}.\n\n=== Dual space ===\n{{main|Dual space}}\nIf {{mvar|X}} is a normed space and {{math|'''K'''}} the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] (either the [[real number|real]] or the [[complex number|complex]] numbers), the [[dual space#Continuous dual space|'''continuous dual space''']] is the space of continuous linear maps from {{mvar|X}} into {{math|'''K'''}}, or '''continuous linear functionals'''. The notation for the continuous dual is {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032 {{=}} ''B''(''X'', '''K''')}} in this article.<ref>Several books about functional analysis use the notation {{math|''X''<sup>&thinsp;\u2217</sup>}} for the continuous dual, for example {{harvtxt|Carothers|2005}}, {{harvtxt|Lindenstrauss|Tzafriri|1977}}, {{harvtxt|Megginson|1998}}, {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}, {{harvtxt|Wojtaszczyk|1991}}.</ref> Since {{math|'''K'''}} is a Banach space (using the [[absolute value]] as norm), the dual {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032}} is a Banach space, for every normed space {{mvar|X}}.\n\nThe main tool for proving the existence of continuous linear functionals is the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]].\n\n:'''Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.'''

Being the dual of a normed space, the bidual {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032}} is complete, therefore, every reflexive normed space is a Banach space.\n\nUsing the isometric embedding {{math|''F<sub>X</sub>''}}, it is customary to consider a normed space {{mvar|X}} as a subset of its bidual. When {{mvar|X}} is a Banach space, it is viewed as a closed linear subspace of {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032}}. If {{mvar|X}} is not reflexive, the unit ball of {{mvar|X}} is a proper subset of the unit ball of {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032}}. The [[Goldstine theorem]] states that the unit ball of a normed space is weakly*-dense in the unit ball of the bidual. In other words, for every {{math|''x''\u2009\u2032\u2032}} in the bidual, there exists a [[Net (mathematics)|net]] {{math|{''x<sub>j</sub>''} }} in {{mvar|X}} so that\n\n:<math>\\sup_j \\|x_j\\| \\le \\|x''\\|, \\ \\ x''(f) = \\lim_j f(x_j), \\quad f \\in X'.</math>\n\nThe net may be replaced by a weakly*-convergent sequence when the dual {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032}} is separable. On the other hand, elements of the bidual of {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}} that are not in {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}} cannot be weak*-limit of ''sequences'' in {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}}, since {{math|\u2113<sup>1</sup>}} is [[Banach space#Weak convergences of sequences|weakly sequentially complete]].\n\n=== Banach's theorems ===\nHere are the main general results about Banach spaces that go back to the time of Banach's book ({{harvtxt|Banach|1932}}) and are related to the [[Baire category theorem]]. According to this theorem, a complete metric space (such as a Banach space, a [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] or an [[F-space]]) cannot be equal to a union of countably many closed subsets with empty [[Interior (topology)|interiors]]. Therefore, a Banach space cannot be the union of countably many closed subspaces, unless it is already equal to one of them; a Banach space with a countable [[Hamel basis]] is finite-dimensional.\n\n:'''[[Uniform boundedness principle|Banach\u2013Steinhaus Theorem.]]''' Let {{mvar|X}} be a Banach space and {{mvar|Y}} be a [[normed vector space]]. Suppose that {{mvar|F}} is a collection of continuous linear operators from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}. The uniform boundedness principle states that if for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} we have {{math|sup<sub>''T''\u2208''F''</sub> {{!!}}''T''(''x''){{!!}}<sub>''Y''</sub> < \u221e}}, then {{math|sup<sub>''T''\u2208''F''</sub> {{!!}}''T''{{!!}}<sub>''Y''</sub> < \u221e}}.\n\nThe Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem is not limited to Banach spaces. It can be extended for example to the case where {{mvar|X}} is a [[Fr\u00e9chet space]], provided the conclusion is modified as follows: under the same hypothesis, there exists a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} of {{math|'''0'''}} in {{mvar|X}} such that all {{mvar|T}} in {{mvar|F}} are uniformly bounded on {{mvar|U}},\n\n:<math>\\sup_{T \\in F} \\sup_{x \\in U} \\; \\|T(x)\\|_Y < \\infty.</math>\n\n:'''[[Open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|The Open Mapping Theorem.]]''' Let {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} be Banach spaces and {{math|''T'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} be a surjective continuous linear operator, then {{mvar|T}} is an open map.\n\n:'''Corollary.'''

If {{mvar|X}} is a reflexive Banach space, every closed subspace of {{mvar|X}} and every quotient space of {{mvar|X}} are reflexive.\n\nThis is a consequence of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.

If {{mvar|X}} is reflexive and separable, then the dual of {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032}} is separable, so {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032}} is separable.\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Suppose that {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X<sub>n</sub>''}} are normed spaces and that {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''X''<sub>1</sub> \u2295 ... \u2295 ''X<sub>n</sub>''}}. Then {{mvar|X}} is reflexive if and only if each {{math|''X<sub>j</sub>''}} is reflexive.\n\nHilbert spaces are reflexive. The {{math|''L<sup>p</sup>''}} spaces are reflexive when {{math|1 < ''p'' < \u221e}}. More generally, [[uniformly convex space]]s are reflexive, by the [[Milman\u2013Pettis theorem]]. The spaces {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>, \u2113<sup>1</sup>, ''L''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1]), ''C''([0, 1])}} are not reflexive. In these examples of non-reflexive spaces {{mvar|X}}, the bidual {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032}} is \"much larger\" than {{mvar|X}}. Namely, under the natural isometric embedding of {{mvar|X}} into {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032}} given by the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, the quotient {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032\u2032\u2009/\u2009''X''}} is infinite-dimensional, and even nonseparable.

A Banach space {{mvar|X}} is reflexive if and only if its unit ball is [[compact space|compact]] in the [[weak topology]].\n\nWhen {{mvar|X}} is reflexive, it follows that all closed and bounded [[Convex set|convex subsets]] of {{mvar|X}} are weakly compact. In a Hilbert space {{mvar|H}}, the weak compactness of the unit ball is very often used in the following way: every bounded sequence in {{mvar|H}} has weakly convergent subsequences.\n\nWeak compactness of the unit ball provides a tool for finding solutions in reflexive spaces to certain [[Infinite-dimensional optimization|optimization problems]]. For example, every [[Convex function|convex]] continuous function on the unit ball {{mvar|B}} of a reflexive space attains its minimum at some point in {{mvar|B}}.\n\nAs a special case of the preceding result, when {{mvar|X}} is a reflexive space over {{math|'''R'''}}, every continuous linear functional {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}} in {{math|''X''\u2009\u2032}} attains its maximum {{math|{{!!}}&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;{{!!}}}} on the unit ball of {{mvar|X}}.

Every element {{mvar|z}} in {{math|''X'' \u2297 ''Y''}} is a finite sum of such simple tensors.\n\nThere are various norms that can be placed on the tensor product of the underlying vector spaces, amongst others the [[Topological tensor product#Cross norms and tensor products of Banach spaces|projective cross norm]] and [[Topological tensor product#Cross norms and tensor products of Banach spaces|injective cross norm]] introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck|A. Grothendieck]] in 1955.<ref>see A. Grothendieck, \"Produits tensoriels topologiques et espaces nucl\u00e9aires\". Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 1955 (1955), no. 16, 140 pp., and A.

When working with Banach spaces, it is customary to say that the '''projective tensor product'''<ref>see chap.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;15 in {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}.</ref> of two Banach spaces {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} is the ''completion'' <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi Y</math> of the algebraic tensor product {{math|''X'' \u2297 ''Y''}} equipped with the projective tensor norm, and similarly for the '''injective tensor product'''<ref>see chap.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;45 in {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}.</ref> <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon Y</math>. Grothendieck proved in particular that<ref>see Example.&nbsp;2.19, p.&nbsp;29, and pp.&nbsp;49\u201350 in {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nC(K) \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon Y &\\simeq C(K, Y), \\\\\nL^1([0, 1]) \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi Y &\\simeq L^1([0, 1], Y),\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|K}} is a compact Hausdorff space, {{math|''C''(''K'', ''Y'')}} the Banach space of continuous functions from {{mvar|K}} to {{mvar|Y}} and {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>([0, 1], ''Y'')}} the space of Bochner-measurable and integrable functions from {{math|[0, 1]}} to {{mvar|Y}}, and where the isomorphisms are isometric. The two isomorphisms above are the respective extensions of the map sending the tensor {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;\u2009\u2297\u2009''y''}} to the vector-valued function {{math|''s'' \u2208 ''K'' \u2192 &thinsp;''f''&thinsp;(''s'')''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}}.\n\n=== Tensor products and the approximation property ===\nLet {{mvar|X}} be a Banach space. The tensor product <math>X' \\widehat \\otimes_\\varepsilon X</math> is identified isometrically with the closure in {{math|''B''(''X'')}} of the set of finite rank operators. When {{mvar|X}} has the [[approximation property]], this closure coincides with the space of [[compact operator]]s on {{mvar|X}}.\n\nFor every Banach space {{mvar|Y}}, there is a natural norm {{math|1}} linear map\n\n:<math> Y \\widehat\\otimes_\\pi X \\to Y \\widehat\\otimes_\\varepsilon X </math>\n\nobtained by extending the identity map of the algebraic tensor product. Grothendieck related the [[Approximation property|approximation problem]] to the question of whether this map is one-to-one when {{mvar|Y}} is the dual of {{mvar|X}}. Precisely, for every Banach space {{mvar|X}}, the map\n\n:<math> X' \\widehat \\otimes_\\pi X \\ \\longrightarrow X' \\widehat \\otimes_\\varepsilon X </math>\n\nis one-to-one if and only if {{mvar|X}} has the approximation property.<ref>see Proposition&nbsp;4.6, p.&nbsp;74 in {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}.</ref>\n\nGrothendieck conjectured that <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi Y</math> and <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon Y</math> must be different whenever {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This was disproved by [[Gilles Pisier]] in 1983.<ref>see Pisier, Gilles (1983), \"Counterexamples to a conjecture of Grothendieck\", Acta Math. '''151''':181\u2013208.</ref> Pisier constructed an infinite-dimensional Banach space {{mvar|X}} such that <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi X</math> and <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon X</math> are equal. Furthermore, just as [[Per Enflo|Enflo's]] example, this space {{mvar|X}} is a \"hand-made\" space that fails to have the approximation property. On the other hand, Szankowski proved that the classical space {{math|''B''(\u2113<sup>2</sup>)}} does not have the approximation property.<ref>see Szankowski, Andrzej (1981), \"{{math|''B''(''H'')}} does not have the approximation property\", Acta Math. '''147''': 89\u2013108. Ryan claims that this result is due to [[Per Enflo]], p.&nbsp;74 in {{harvtxt|Ryan|2002}}.</ref>\n\n== Some classification results ==\n\n=== Characterizations of Hilbert space among Banach spaces ===\nA necessary and sufficient condition for the norm of a Banach space {{mvar|X}} to be associated to an inner product is the [[parallelogram identity]]:\n\n:<math>\\forall x, y \\in X : \\qquad \\|x+y\\|^2 + \\|x-y\\|^2 = 2 \\left (\\|x\\|^2 + \\|y\\|^2 \\right).</math>\n\nIt follows, for example, that the [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] {{math|''L<sup>p</sup>''([0, 1])}} is a Hilbert space only when {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}. If this identity is satisfied, the associated inner product is given by the [[polarization identity]]. In the case of real scalars, this gives:\n\n:<math>\\langle x, y\\rangle = \\tfrac{1}{4} \\left (\\|x+y\\|^2 - \\|x-y\\|^2 \\right ).</math>\n\nFor complex scalars, defining the [[Inner product space|inner product]] so as to be {{math|'''C'''}}-linear in {{mvar|x}}, [[Antilinear map|antilinear]] in {{mvar|y}}, the polarization identity gives:\n\n:<math>\\langle x,y\\rangle = \\tfrac{1}{4} \\left( \\|x+y\\|^2 - \\|x-y\\|^2 + i \\left (\\|x+iy\\|^2 - \\|x-iy\\|^2 \\right )\\right).</math>\n\nTo see that the parallelogram law is sufficient, one observes in the real case that {{math|<&thinsp;''x'', ''y''&thinsp;>}} is symmetric, and in the complex case, that it satisfies the [[Hermitian symmetry]] property and {{math|<&thinsp;''ix'', ''y''&thinsp;> {{=}} ''i''&thinsp;<&thinsp;''x'', ''y''&thinsp;>}}. The parallelogram law implies that {{math|<&thinsp;''x'', ''y''&thinsp;>}} is additive in {{mvar|x}}. It follows that it is linear over the rationals, thus linear by continuity.\n\nSeveral characterizations of spaces isomorphic (rather than isometric) to Hilbert spaces are available. The parallelogram law can be extended to more than two vectors, and weakened by the introduction of a two-sided inequality with a constant {{math|''c'' \u2265 1}}: Kwapie\u0144 proved that if\n\n:<math> c^{-2} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left \\|x_k \\right \\|^2 \\le \\operatorname{Ave}_{\\pm} \\left \\| \\sum_{k=1}^n \\pm x_k \\right \\|^2 \\le c^2 \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left \\|x_k \\right \\|^2</math>\n\nfor every integer {{mvar|n}} and all families of vectors {{math|{''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>''} \u2282 ''X''}}, then the Banach space {{mvar|X}} is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.<ref>see Kwapie\u0144, S. (1970), \"A linear topological characterization of inner-product spaces\", Studia Math. '''38''':277\u2013278.</ref> Here, {{math|Ave<sub>\u00b1</sub>}} denotes the average over the {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>}} possible choices of signs {{math|\u00b11}}. In the same article, Kwapie\u0144 proved that the validity of a Banach-valued [[Parseval's theorem]] for the Fourier transform characterizes Banach spaces isomorphic to Hilbert spaces.\n\nLindenstrauss and Tzafriri proved that a Banach space in which every closed linear subspace is complemented (that is, is the range of a bounded linear projection) is isomorphic to a Hilbert space.<ref>see Lindenstrauss, J. and Tzafriri, L. (1971), \"On the complemented subspaces problem\", Israel J. Math. '''9''':263\u2013269.</ref> The proof rests upon [[Dvoretzky's theorem]] about Euclidean sections of high-dimensional centrally symmetric convex bodies. In other words, Dvoretzky's theorem states that for every integer {{mvar|n}}, any finite-dimensional normed space, with dimension sufficiently large compared to {{mvar|n}}, contains subspaces nearly isometric to the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nThe next result gives the solution of the so-called ''homogeneous space problem''. An infinite-dimensional Banach space {{mvar|X}} is said to be '''homogeneous''' if it is isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces. A Banach space isomorphic to {{math|\u2113<sup>2</sup>}} is homogeneous, and Banach asked for the converse.<ref>see p.&nbsp;245 in {{harvtxt|Banach|1932}}. The homogeneity property is called \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9&nbsp;(15)\" there. Banach writes: \"on ne conna\u00eet aucun exemple d'espace \u00e0 une infinit\u00e9 de dimensions qui, sans \u00eatre isomorphe avec (''L''<sup>2</sup>), poss\u00e8de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9&nbsp;(15)\".</ref>\n\n:'''Theorem.'''<ref name=\"Gowers\">Gowers, W.

See the articles on the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]] and the [[G\u00e2teaux derivative]] for details. The Fr\u00e9chet derivative allows for an extension of the concept of a [[directional derivative]] to Banach spaces. The G\u00e2teaux derivative allows for an extension of a [[directional derivative]] to [[locally convex]] [[topological vector space]]s. Fr\u00e9chet differentiability is a stronger condition than G\u00e2teaux differentiability. The [[quasi-derivative]] is another generalization of directional derivative that implies a stronger condition than G\u00e2teaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fr\u00e9chet differentiability.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nSeveral important spaces in functional analysis, for instance the space of all infinitely often differentiable functions '''R''' \u2192 '''R''', or the space of all [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on '''R''', are complete but are not normed vector spaces and hence not Banach spaces. In [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s one still has a complete [[metric space|metric]], while [[LF-space]]s are complete [[uniform space|uniform]] vector spaces arising as limits of Fr\u00e9chet spaces.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Space (mathematics)]]\n** [[Hilbert space]]\n** [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> space]]\n** [[Sobolev space]]\n** [[Hardy space]]\n* [[Interpolation space]]\n* [[Distortion problem]]\n* [[Smith space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|first=Stefan|last=Banach|authorlink=Stefan Banach|url=http://kielich.amu.edu.pl/Stefan_Banach/pdf/teoria-operacji-fr/banach-teorie-des-operations-lineaires.pdf|title=Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires|publication-place=Warszawa|publisher=Subwencji Funduszu Kultury Narodowej|year=1932|series=Monografie Matematyczne|volume=1|zbl=0005.20901}}.\n* {{citation\n|author=Beauzamy, Bernard\n|title=Introduction to Banach Spaces and their Geometry\n|year=1985 |origyear=1982\n|edition=Second revised\n|publisher=North-Holland\n}}.\n* {{citation|first=Nicolas|last=Bourbaki|authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Topological vector spaces|series=Elements of mathematics|publisher= Springer-Verlag|publication-place=Berlin|year=1987|isbn=978-3-540-13627-9}}.\n* {{citation\n | last = Carothers | first = Neal L.\n | title = A short course on Banach space theory\n | series = London Mathematical Society Student Texts\n | volume = 64\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | year = 2005\n | pages = xii+184\n | isbn = 0-521-84283-2\n}}.\n* {{citation\n | last = Diestel\n | first = Joseph\n | title = Sequences and series in Banach spaces\n | series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics\n | volume = 92\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | location = New York\n | year = 1984\n | pages = xii+261\n | isbn = 0-387-90859-5\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n | last1=Dunford | first1=Nelson\n | last2=Schwartz | first2=Jacob T. with the assistance of W.

Of this time, Stoker wrote, \"I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.\" He was educated in a private school run by the Rev. William Woods.<ref name=obit>Obituary, Irish Times, 23 April 1912</ref>\n\nAfter his recovery, he grew up without further serious illnesses, even excelling as an athlete (he was named University Athlete, participating in multiple sports) at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], which he attended from 1864 to 1870.  He graduated with a BA in 1870, and purchased his MA in 1875.

He became the theatre critic for the ''[[Dublin Evening Mail]]'', which was co-owned by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], an author of Gothic tales. Theatre critics were held in low esteem, but he attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876, he gave a favourable review of Henry Irving's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal]] in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] where he was staying, and they became friends. Stoker also wrote stories, and \"The Crystal Cup\" was published by the London Society in 1872, followed by \"[http://bramstoker.org/pdf/stories/04other/destinyts.pdf The Chain of Destiny]\" in four parts in ''The Shamrock''. In 1876 while a [[civil servant]] in Dublin, Stoker wrote the non-fiction book ''The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland'' (published 1879) which remained a standard work.<ref name=\"obit\"/> Furthermore, he possessed an interest in art, and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1879.\n\n==Lyceum Theatre==\n[[File:Bram Stoker's Home.jpg|thumb|left|Bram Stoker's former home, [[Kildare Street]], Dublin]]\nIn 1878 Stoker married [[Florence Balcombe]], daughter of [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent.  She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>Irish Times, 8 March 1882, page 5</ref> Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university's Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and after Wilde's fall visited him on the Continent.<ref name=\"irtimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0328/1224243595688.html|author= |title=Why Dracula never loses his bite |date=28 March 2009 |website=Irish Times }}</ref>\n[[File:Dracula1st.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first edition cover of ''Dracula'']]\nThe Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting manager and then business manager of [[Henry Irving|Irving]]'s [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence's only child was born, a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him he became involved in London's [[upper class|high society]], where he met [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London Stoker also met [[Hall Caine]], who became one of his closest friends \u2013 he dedicated ''Dracula'' to him.\n\nIn the course of Irving's tours, Stoker travelled the world, although he never visited [[Eastern Europe]], a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the United States, where Irving was popular. With Irving he was invited twice to the [[White House]], and knew [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Stoker set two of his novels there, using Americans as characters, the most notable being [[Quincey Morris]]. He also met one of his literary idols, [[Walt Whitman]].\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Bram Stoker Plaque Whitby England.jpg|right|thumb|Bram Stoker Commemorative Plaque, [[Whitby]], England]]\nStoker visited the English coastal town of [[Whitby]] in 1890, and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for ''[[Dracula]]''. He began writing novels while working as manager for [[Henry Irving]] and secretary and director of London's Lyceum Theatre, beginning with ''[[The Snake's Pass]]'' in 1890 and ''Dracula'' in 1897. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in London, and he wrote other fiction, including the horror novels ''[[The Lady of the Shroud]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]'' (1911).<ref name=WorldBio/>  He published his ''[[Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving]]'' in 1906, after Irving's death, which proved successful,<ref name=obit /> and managed productions at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].\n\nBefore writing ''Dracula'', Stoker met [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]], a Hungarian writer and traveller.

The original plan had been to keep his parents' ashes together, but after Florence Stoker's death, her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest.\n\n==Beliefs and philosophy==\nStoker was raised a Protestant in the [[Church of Ireland]]. He was a strong supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and took a keen interest in Irish affairs.<ref name=obit /> As a \"philosophical home ruler,\" he supported [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire, an entity that he saw as a force for good. He was an admirer of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], whom he knew personally, and supported his plans for Ireland.<ref>Murray, Paul. ''From the Shadow of Dracula: A Life of Bram Stoker''. 2004.</ref>\n\nStoker believed in progress and took a keen interest in [[science]] and science-based [[medicine]]. Some Stoker novels represent early examples of [[science fiction]], such as ''[[The Lady of the Shroud]]'' (1909). He had a writer's interest in the occult, notably [[mesmerism]], but despised fraud and believed in the superiority of the [[scientific method]] over superstition. Stoker counted among his friends J. W. Brodie-Innis, a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and hired member [[Pamela Colman Smith]] as an artist for the Lyceum Theatre, but no evidence suggests that Stoker ever joined the Order himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm |title=Shadowplay Pagan and Magick webzine \u2013 HERMETIC HORRORS |publisher=Shadowplayzine.com |date=16 September 1904 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109074626/http://shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm |archivedate=9 November 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The occult power behind the spear which pierced the side of Christ |first=Trevor |last=Ravenscroft |year=1982 |publisher=Red Wheel |pages=165 |isbn=978-0-87728-547-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ |first=Lynn |last=Picknett |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |pages=201 |isbn=978-0-7432-7325-1}}</ref>\n\n==Posthumous==\nThe short story collection ''[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories]]'' was published in 1914 by Stoker's widow, Florence Stoker, who was also his literary executrix. The first film adaptation of ''Dracula'' was [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', released in 1922, with [[Max Schreck]] starring as Count Orlok. Florence Stoker eventually sued the filmmakers, and was represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. Her chief legal complaint was that she had neither been asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widow's favour in July 1925. A single print of the film survived, however, and it has become well known. The first authorised film version of ''Dracula'' did not come about until almost a decade later when [[Universal Studios]] released [[Tod Browning]]'s ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' starring [[Bela Lugosi]].\n\n===Dacre Stoker===\n[[Canadians|Canadian]] writer [[Dacre Stoker]], a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, decided to write \"a sequel that bore the Stoker name\" to \"reestablish creative control over\" the original novel, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, because of the Stokers' frustrating history with ''Dracula's'' copyright. In 2009, ''[[Dracula the Un-dead|Dracula: The Un-Dead]]'' was released, written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers \"based [their work] on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition\" along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stoker's writing debut.<ref>''Dracula: The Un-Dead'' by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt</ref><ref>[http://www.draculatheundead.com/stoker-book-overview.htm ''Dracula: The Undead'''s overview]</ref>\n\nIn Spring 2012, Dacre Stoker (in collaboration with Prof. Elizabeth Miller) presented the \"lost\" Dublin Journal written by Bram Stoker, which had been kept by his great-grandson Noel Dobbs. Stoker's diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his London years. A remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the Renfield character in ''Dracula''.<ref>Stoker, Bram.

For competition level, so called [[International Match Points|IMP]] score is of high significance.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nOne theory is that the name ''bridge'' has its origins in the name of an earlier game. Bridge departed from [[whist]] with the creation of [[s:Biritch, or Russian Whist|Biritch (or ''Russian Whist'')]] in the 19th century, and evolved through the late 19th and early 20th centuries to form the present game. The word ''biritch'' itself is a spelling of the Russian word [[:ru:\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u0447|\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u0447]] (\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0439, \u0431\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447), an occupation of a diplomatic clerk or an announcer.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} However some experts think that the Russian origin of the game is a fallacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/172810/etymology-of-bridge-the-card-game|title=Etymology of \"bridge\" (the card game) |website=English Language & Usage |publisher=Stack Exchange |author=|date= |accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2018}}\n\nAnother theory is that British soldiers invented the game bridge while serving in the [[Crimean War]]. The game \"got its name from the [[Galata Bridge]], a bridge spanning the Golden Horn and linking the old and new parts of European Istanbul, where they apparently crossed every day to go to a coffeehouse to play cards.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/news/bridge-317092.html |title=Bridge |author=Alan Truscott |date=February 2, 1992 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Four overlapping playing cards.jpg|thumb|<center><big>'''A trick'''</big></center><br>North led the 10{{Spades}} so all players must play a spade unless they have none.<ref name=\"law44\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 44, pp. 20&ndash;21.</ref> East \"follows suit\" with the K{{spades}}, South the J{{diamonds}} and West the 7{{hearts}}. In a notrump game, East wins the trick, having played the highest spade card. However, if diamonds or hearts are trumps, South or West respectively win.]]\n\n=== Overview ===\nBridge is a four-player partnership [[trick-taking game]] with thirteen tricks per deal.<ref name=\"law1\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 1, p. 3.</ref><ref name=\"law3\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 3, pp. 3&ndash;4.</ref> The dominant variations of the game are [[rubber bridge]], more common in social play; and [[duplicate bridge]], which enables comparative scoring in tournament play. Each player is dealt thirteen cards from a standard 52-card deck. A {{gcb|trick|trick}} starts when a player leads, i.e. plays the first card. The leader to the first trick is determined by the auction; the leader to each subsequent trick is the player who won the preceding trick. Each player, in a clockwise order, plays one card on the trick. Players must play a card of the same suit as the original card led, unless they have none (said to be \"void\"), in which case they may play any card.<ref name=\"law44\" />\n\nThe player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick. Within a suit, the ace is ranked highest followed by the king, queen and jack and then the ten through to the two. In a deal where the auction has determined that there is no trump suit, the trick must be won by a card of the suit led. However, in a deal where there is a trump suit, cards of that suit are superior in rank to any of the cards of any other suit. If one or more players plays a trump to a trick when void in the suit led, the highest trump wins. For example, if the trump suit is spades and a player is void in the suit led and plays a spade card, he wins the trick if no other player plays a higher spade. If a trump suit is led, the usual rule for trick-taking applies.<ref name=\"law44\" />\n\nUnlike its predecessor [[Whist]], the goal of bridge is not simply to take the most tricks in a deal.{{Sfn|Gibson|1974|pp=632\u2013636}} Instead, the goal is to successfully estimate how many tricks one's partnership can take.<ref name=\"law72a\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 72(a), pp. 34&ndash;35.</ref> To illustrate this, the simpler partnership trick-taking game of [[Spades (card game)|Spades]] has a similar mechanism: the usual trick-taking rules apply with the trump suit being spades, but in the beginning of the game, players ''bid'' or estimate how many tricks they can win, and the number of tricks bid by both players in a partnership are added. If a partnership takes at least that many number of tricks, they receive points for the round; otherwise, they receive penalty points.\n\nBridge extends the concept of bidding into an {{gcb|auction}}, where partnerships compete to take a {{gcb|contract}}, specifying how many tricks they will need to take in order to receive points, and also specifying the trump suit (or no trump, meaning that there will be no trump suit). Players take turns to call in a clockwise order: each player in turn either passes, doubles&mdash;which increases the penalties for not making the contract specified by the opposing partnership's last bid, but also increases the reward for making it<ref name=\"law19\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 19, p. 10.</ref>\u2014or redoubles, or states a contract that their partnership will adopt, which must be higher than the previous highest bid (if any).<ref name=\"law18\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 18, p. 10.</ref> Eventually, the player who bid the highest contract&mdash;which is determined by the contract's level as well as the trump suit or no trump&mdash;wins the contract for their partnership.\n\nIn the example auction on the right, the East-West pair secures the contract of 6{{spades}}; the auction concludes when there have been three successive passes.<ref name=\"law22\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 22, p. 11.</ref> Note that six tricks are added to contract values, so the six-level contract would actually be a contract of twelve tricks.{{Sfn|Gibson|1974|p=135}}<ref name=\"law81\">[[#rubberlaws|Laws of Rubber Bridge]], Law 81, pp. 37&ndash;39</ref> In practice, establishing a contract without enough information on the other partner's hand is difficult, so there exist many [[bidding system]]s assigning meanings to bids, with common ones including [[Standard American]], [[Acol]], and [[2/1 game forcing]].

If the contract was doubled or redoubled, the declaring side receives 200 and 400 points respectively. Additional bonus points may apply depending on the variation played; for example, in duplicate bridge, the declaring side is awarded a game bonus for having won 100 or more contract points, which is 500 if vulnerable, for a total of 600 points (500 + 100), or 300 if not vulnerable, for a total of 400 points (300 + 100).}}\n\nIn rubber bridge, a partnership wins one game once it has accumulated 100 contract points; excess contract points do not carry over to the next game.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''Bridge'' is the [[English language|English]] pronunciation of a game called ''[[Biritch]]'', which was also known as Russian Whist.\n\nHowever, the idea of a trick-taking 52-card game has its first documented origins in Italy and France. The French physician [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais|Rabelais]] (1493-1553) mentions a game called \"La Triomphe\" in one of his works. In 1526 the Italian [[Francesco Berni]] wrote the oldest known (as of 1960) textbook on a game very similar to Whist, known as \"Triomfi\". Also, a Spanish textbook in Latin from the first half of the 16th century, \"Triumphens Historicus\", deals with the same subject.<ref>\"Bridge\", edited by Alvar Stenberg, Hans-Olof Hall\u00e9n and Einar Werner in 1960, p12-13 (of 909), published by \"Svensk Bridge Litteratur\" (Swedish Bridge Litterature), Malm\u00f6 1960 (no ISBN)</ref>\n\nThe oldest known Biritch rule book, dated 1886, is ''[[s:Biritch, or Russian Whist|Biritch, or Russian Whist]]'' by John Collinson. It and his subsequent letter to ''The Saturday Review'' dated May 28, 1906, document the origin of ''Biritch'' as being the Russian community in Istanbul.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  |last1 = Depaulis\n  |first1 = Thierry\n  |authorlink1 =\n  |last2 = Fuchs\n  |first2 = Jac\n  |authorlink2 =\n  |title = First Steps of Bridge in the West: Collinson's 'Biritch'\n  |publisher = [[International Playing-Card Society|The International Playing-Card Society]] |magazine= The Playing-Card |volume= 32 |issue= 2\n  |url = http://levantineheritage.com/pdf/Biritch.pdf\n  |series =\n  |date = Sep\u2013Oct 2003\n  |doi =\n  |isbn = \n  |pages = 67\u201376}}</ref> It has some features in common with [[Solo Whist]]. The game had many significant bridge-like developments: dealer chose the [[trump (cards)|trump]] suit, or nominated his partner to do so; there was a call of notrumps (''biritch''); dealer's partner's hand became dummy; points were scored above and below the line; game was 3NT, 4H and 5D (although 8 club odd tricks and 15 spade odd tricks were needed); the score could be doubled and redoubled; and there were slam bonuses.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Collinson |date=9 July 1886 |title=Biritch, or Russian Whist |url=http://www.pagat.com/boston/biritch.html |via=Pagat.com [2007] |accessdate=2018-07-29}}</ref> This game, and variants of it known as \"bridge\"<ref>(Elwell 1905 and Benedict 1900)</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}} and \"bridge-whist\",<ref>(Melrose 1901)</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}  became popular in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1890s despite the long-established dominance of whist.<ref>(Foster 1889)</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 1904 [[auction bridge]] was developed, in which the players bid in a competitive auction to decide the contract and declarer. The object became to make at least as many tricks as were contracted for, and penalties were introduced for failing to do so. Auction bridge bidding beyond winning the auction is pointless. If taking all 13 tricks, there is no difference in score between a 1{{spades}} and a 7{{spades}} final bid, as no bonus for game, small slam or grand slam exists.\n\nThe modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to the scoring of auction bridge by [[Harold Stirling Vanderbilt]] and others. The most significant change was that only the tricks contracted for were scored below the line toward game or a slam bonus, a change that resulted in bidding becoming much more challenging and interesting. Also new was the concept of \"vulnerability\", making sacrifices to protect the lead in a rubber more expensive. The various [[bridge scoring|scores]] were adjusted to produce a more balanced and interesting game. Vanderbilt set out his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had so supplanted other forms of the game that \"bridge\" became synonymous with \"contract bridge\".\n\nIn the US and many other countries, most of the bridge played today is [[duplicate bridge]], which is played at clubs, in tournaments and online. The number of people playing contract bridge has declined since its peak in the 1940s, when a survey found it was played in 44% of US households. The game is still widely played, especially amongst retirees, and in 2005 the [[American Contract Bridge League|ACBL]] estimated there were 25 million players in the US.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=David Owen |title=Turning Tricks \u2013 The rise and fall of contract bridge |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/09/17/070917crbo_books_owen |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=September 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Tournaments==\nBridge is a game of skill played with [[random]]ly dealt cards, which makes it also a [[game of chance]], or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication. The chance element is in the deal of the cards; in duplicate bridge some of the chance element is eliminated by comparing results of multiple pairs in identical situations. This is achievable when there are eight or more players, sitting at two or more tables, and the deals from each table are preserved and passed to the next table, thereby ''duplicating'' them for the other table(s) of players. At the end of a session, the scores for each deal are compared, and the most points are awarded to the players doing the best with each particular deal. This measures relative skill (but still with an element of luck) because each pair or team is being judged only on the ability to bid with, and play, the same cards as other players.\n\nDuplicate bridge is played in clubs and tournaments, which can gather as many as several hundred players. Duplicate bridge is a [[mind sport]], and its popularity gradually became comparable to that of [[chess]], with which it is often compared for its complexity and the mental skills required for high-level competition. Bridge and chess are the only \"mind sports\" recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]], although they were not found eligible for the main [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] program.<ref name=\"IOC\">{{cite web|title=Review of the Olympic programme and the recommendations on the programme of the games of the XXIX Olympiad, Beijing 2008 |author=Franco Carraro (Olympic Programme Commission Chairman) |page=8 |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_527.pdf |publisher=IOC Executive Board |date=August 2002}}</ref> In October 2017 the British High Court ruled against the English Bridge Union, finding that Bridge is not a sport under a definition of sport as involving physical activity, but did not rule on the \"broad, somewhat philosophical question\" as to whether or not bridge is a sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34537024 |title=High Court rules bridge is not a sport |website=BBC News |date=15 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise of duplicate bridge had previously been used for whist matches as early as 1857. Initially, bridge was not thought to be suitable for duplicate competition; it was not until the 1920s that (auction) bridge tournaments became popular.\n\nIn 1925 when contract bridge first evolved, bridge tournaments were becoming popular, but the rules were somewhat in flux, and several different organizing bodies were involved in tournament sponsorship: the [[American Bridge League]] (formerly the ''American Auction Bridge League'', which changed its name in 1929), the [[American Whist League]], and the [[United States Bridge Association]]. In 1935, the first officially recognized world championship was held. By 1937, however, the [[American Contract Bridge League|American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)]] had come to power (a union of the ABL and the USBA), and it remains the sanctioning body for [[North American Bridge Championships|bridge tournaments]] in North America. In 1958, the [[World Bridge Federation|World Bridge Federation (WBF)]] was founded to promote bridge worldwide, coordinate periodic revision to the Laws (each ten years, next in 2017) and conduct world championships.{{sfn|Francis et al.|2001|p= 576. See World Bridge Federation (WBF)}}\n\n===Bidding boxes and bidding screens===\n\nIn tournaments, \"[[bidding box]]es\" are frequently used, as noted above. These avoid the possibility of players at other tables hearing any spoken bids.  The bidding cards are laid out in sequence as the auction progresses.  Although it is not a formal rule, many clubs adopt a protocol that the bidding cards stay revealed until the first playing card is tabled, after which point the bidding cards are put away.\n\nIn top national and international events, \"[[screen (bridge)|bidding screens]]\" are used. These are placed diagonally across the table, preventing partners from seeing each other during the game; often the screen is removed after the auction is complete.\n\n==Game strategy==\n\n===Bidding===\n{{Main|Bidding system|Bridge convention}}\n\nMuch of the complexity in bridge arises from the difficulty of arriving at a good final contract in the auction (or deciding to let the opponents declare the contract). This is a difficult problem: the two players in a partnership must try to communicate enough information about their hands to arrive at a makeable contract, but the information they can exchange is restricted&nbsp;\u2013 information may be passed only by the calls made and later by the cards played, not by other means; in addition, the agreed-upon meaning of each call and play must be available to the opponents.\n\nSince a partnership that has freedom to bid gradually at leisure can exchange more information, and since a partnership that can interfere with the opponents' bidding (as by raising the bidding level rapidly) can cause difficulties for their opponents, bidding systems are both informational and strategic. It is this mixture of information exchange and evaluation, deduction, and tactics that is at the heart of bidding in bridge.\n\nA number of basic [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] in bridge bidding and play are summarized as [[bridge maxims]].\n\n====Bidding systems and conventions====\nA ''bidding system'' is a set of partnership agreements on the meanings of bids. A partnership's bidding system is usually made up of a core system, modified and complemented by specific [[convention (bridge)|conventions]] (optional customizations incorporated into the main system for handling specific bidding situations) which are pre-chosen between the partners prior to play. The line between a well-known convention and a part of a system is not always clear-cut: some bidding systems include specified conventions by default. Bidding systems can be divided into mainly natural systems such as [[Acol]] and [[Standard American]], and mainly artificial systems such as the [[Precision Club]] and [[Polish Club]].\n\nCalls are usually considered to be either ''natural'' or ''conventional'' (artificial). A natural call carries a meaning that reflects the call; a natural bid intuitively showing hand or suit strength based on the level or suit of the bid, and a natural double expressing that the player believes that the opposing partnership will not make their contract. By contrast, a conventional (artificial) call offers and/or asks for information by means of pre-agreed coded interpretations, in which some calls convey very specific information or requests that are not part of the natural meaning of the call. Thus in response to 4NT, a 'natural' bid of 5{{Diams}} would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play the contract in 5 diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common [[Blackwood convention]], a bid of 5{{Diams}} in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace.\n\nConventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by adopting a conventional (artificial) meaning for a given call where a natural meaning would have less utility, because the information it would convey is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information would arise only rarely. The conventional meaning conveys more useful (or more frequently useful) information. There are a very large number of conventions from which players can choose; many books have been written detailing bidding conventions. Well-known conventions include [[Stayman]] (to ask the opening 1NT bidder to show any four-card major suit), [[Jacoby transfer]]s (a request by (usually) the weak hand for the partner to bid a particular suit first, and therefore to become the declarer), and the [[Blackwood convention]] (to ask for information on the number of aces and kings held, used in slam bidding situations).\n\nThe term ''[[preempt]]'' refers to a high-level tactical bid by a weak hand, relying upon a very long suit rather than high cards for tricks. Preemptive bids serve a double purpose&nbsp;\u2013 they allow players to indicate they are bidding on the basis of a long suit in an otherwise weak hand, which is important information to share, and they also consume substantial bidding space which prevents a possibly strong opposing pair from exchanging information on their cards. Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.\n\n====Basic natural systems====\nAs a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.\n\nMost systems use a count of [[high card point]]s as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate. In the most commonly used point count system, aces are counted as 4 points, kings as 3, queens as 2, and jacks as 1 point; therefore, the deck contains 40 points. In addition, the ''distribution'' of the cards in a hand into suits may also contribute to the strength of a hand and be counted as [[Hand evaluation|distribution points]]. A better than average hand, containing 12 or 13 points, is usually considered sufficient to ''open'' the bidding, i.e., to make the first bid in the auction. A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a [[major suit]] or notrump (more are usually needed for a [[minor suit]] game, as the level is higher).\n\nIn natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18&nbsp;\u2013 the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points, (e.g., 12-14, 15-17 or 16-18), but some systems use a four-point range, usually 15-18.\n\nOpening bids of three or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand's value quickly and to frustrate the opposition. For example, a hand of {{BridgeHandInline|KQJ9872|7|42|763}} would be a candidate for an opening bid of 3{{Spades}}, designed to make it difficult for the opposing team to bid and find their [[optimum contract]] even if they have the bulk of the points, as it is nearly valueless unless spades are trumps, it contains good enough spades that the penalty for being set should not be higher than the value of an opponent game, and the high card weakness makes it more likely that the opponents have enough strength to make game themselves.\n\nOpenings at the 2 level are either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2{{Clubs}}, artificial) or preemptive, depending on the system. Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more). Also 2{{Diams}} as the strongest (by HCP and by DP+HCP) has become more common, perhaps especially at websites that offer duplicate bridge. Here the 2{{Clubs}} opening is used for either hands with a good 6-card suit or longer (max one losing card) and a total of 18 HCP up to 23 total points - or \"2\u00bd NT\", like 2NT but with 22-23 HCP. Whilst the 2{{Diams}} opening bid takes care of all hands with 24 point (HCP or with distribution points included) with the only exception of \"Gambeling 3NT\".\n\nOpening bids at the one level are made with hands containing 12\u201313 points or more and which are not suitable for one of the preceding bids. Using [[Standard American]] with [[Five-card majors|5-card majors]], opening hearts or spades usually promises a 5-card suit. Partnerships who agree to play 5-card majors open a [[minor suit]] with 4-card majors and then bid their [[major suit]] at the next opportunity. This means that an opening bid of 1{{Clubs}} or 1{{Diamonds}} will sometimes be made with only 3 cards in that suit.\n\nDoubles are sometimes given conventional meanings in otherwise mostly natural systems. A natural, or ''penalty'' double, is one used to try to gain extra points when the defenders are confident of setting (defeating) the contract. The most common example of a conventional double is the [[takeout double]] of a low-level suit bid, implying support for the unbid suits or the unbid major suits and asking partner to choose one of them.\n\n====Variations on the basic themes====\nBidding systems depart from these basic ideas in varying degrees. [[Standard American]], for instance, is a collection of conventions designed to bolster the accuracy and power of these basic ideas, while [[Precision Club]] is a system that uses the 1{{Clubs}} opening bid for all or almost all strong hands (but sets the threshold for \"strong\" rather lower than most other systems&nbsp;\u2013 usually 16 high card points) and may include other artificial calls to handle other situations (but it may contain natural calls as well). Many experts today use a system called [[2/1 game forcing]] (enunciated as two over one game forcing), which amongst other features adds some complexity to the treatment of the one notrump response as used in Standard American. In the UK, [[Acol]] is the most common system; its main features are a weak one notrump opening with 12-14 high card points and several variations for 2-level openings.\n\nThere are also a variety of advanced techniques used for hand evaluation. The most basic is the [[Milton Work]] point count, (the 4-3-2-1 system detailed above) but this is sometimes modified in various ways, or either augmented or replaced by other approaches such as [[losing trick count]], [[honor point count]], [[law of total tricks]], or [[Zar Points]].\n\nCommon conventions and variations within natural systems include:\n* Point count required for 1 NT opening bid ('mini' 10-12, 'weak' 12-14, 'strong' 15-17 or 16-18)\n* Whether an opening bid of 1{{Hearts}} and 1{{Spades}} requires a minimum of 4 or 5 cards in the suit (''4 or 5 card majors'')\n* Whether 1{{Clubs}} (and sometimes 1{{Diams}}) is 'natural' or 'suspect' ''(also called 'phoney' or 'short')'', signifying an opening hand lacking a notable heart or spade suit\n* Whether opening bids at the two level are 'strong' (20+ points) or '[[Weak two bid|weak]]' (i.e., pre-emptive with a 6 card suit). (Note: an [[Strong two clubs|opening bid]] of 2{{Clubs}} is usually played in otherwise natural systems as conventional, signifying any exceptionally strong hand)\n* ''[[Blackwood convention|Blackwood]]'' (either the original version or ''[[Blackwood convention#Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB)|Roman Key Card]]'')\n* ''[[Stayman convention|Stayman]]'' (together with Blackwood, described as \"the two most famous conventions in Bridge\".<ref>{{cite book |series=Bridge Lessons |title=Stayman & Transfer |at=(Deal 1) |author=Andrew Robson}}</ref>)\n* Whether the partnership will play ''[[Jacoby transfer]]s'' (bids of 2{{Diamonds}} and 2{{Hearts}} over 1NT or 3{{Diamonds}} and 3{{Hearts}} over 2NT respectively require the 1NT or 2NT bidder to rebid 2{{Hearts}} and 2{{Spades}} or 3{{Hearts}} and 3{{Spades}}), ''minor suit transfers'' (bids of 2{{Spades}} and either 2NT or 3{{Clubs}} over 1NT respectively require the 1NT bidder to bid 3{{Clubs}} and 3{{Diamonds}}) and ''Texas transfers'' (bids of 4{{Diamonds}} and 4{{Hearts}} respectively require the 1NT, or 2NT bidder to rebid 4{{Hearts}} and 4{{Spades}})\n* What types of ''[[cue bid]]s (e.g. rebidding the opponents' suit)'' the partnership will play, if any.\n* Whether doubling a contract at the 1, 2 and sometimes higher levels signifies a belief that the opponents' contract will fail and a desire to raise the stakes (a ''penalty double''), or an indication of strength but no biddable suit coupled with a request that partner bid something (a ''[[takeout double]]'').\n* Whether doubling or overcalling over opponents' 1NT is natural or conventional. Most common artificial agreement is [[Cappelletti (bridge convention)|Cappelletti]], where 2{{Clubs}} is a transfer to be passed or corrected to a major, 2{{Diamonds}} means both majors and a major shows that suit plus a minor.\n* How the partnership's bidding practices will be varied if their opponents intervene or compete.\n* Which (if any) bids are ''[[forcing bid|forcing]]'' and require a response.\n\nWithin play, it is also commonly agreed what systems of opening leads, signals and discards will be played:\n* Conventions for the [[opening lead]] govern how the first card to be played will be chosen and what it will mean,\n* [[Signal (bridge)|Signals]] indicate how cards played within a suit are chosen&nbsp;\u2013 for example, playing a noticeably high card when this would not be expected can signal encouragement to continue playing the suit, and a low card can signal discouragement and a desire for partner to choose some other suit. (Some partnerships use \"reverse\" signals, meaning that a noticeably high card ''discourages'' that suit and a noticeably low card ''encourages'' that suit, thus not \"wasting\" a potentially useful intermediate card in the suit of interest.)\n* [[Discard (bridge)|Discards]] cover the situation when a defender cannot follow suit and therefore has free choice what card to play or throw away. In such circumstances the thrown-away card can be used to indicate some aspect of the hand, or a desire for a specific suit to be played.\n* [[Count Signals (bridge)|Count signals]] cover the situation when a defender is following suit (usually to a suit that the declarer has led). In such circumstances the order in which a defender plays his spot cards will indicate whether an even or odd number of cards was originally held in that suit. This can help the other defender count out the entire original distribution of the cards in that suit. It is sometimes critical to know this when defending.\n* [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#SPS|Suit preference signals]] cover the situation where a defender is returning a suit which will be ruffed by his partner. If he plays a high card he is showing an entry in the higher side suit and vice versa. There are some other situations where this tool may be used.\n* [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#Surrogate Signals|Surrogate signals]] cover the situation when it is critical to show length in a side suit and it will be too late if defenders wait until that suit is played. Then, the play in the first declarer played suit is a count signal regarding the critical suit and not the trump suit itself. In fact, any signal made about a suit in another suit might be called as such.\n\n====Advanced bidding techniques====\nEvery call (including \"pass\", also sometimes called \"no bid\") serves two purposes. It confirms or passes some information to a partner, and also denies by implication any other kind of hand which would have tended to support an alternative call. For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner's 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also would almost always deny possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player would probably have used the [[Stayman convention]]).\n\nLikewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2{{Hearts}} in the sequence 1NT - 2{{Clubs}} - 2{{Diams}} - 2{{Hearts}} between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2{{Diams}} denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit).<ref>{{cite book |author=Andrew Robson |series=Bridge Lessons |title=Stayman & Transfer |at=(Deal 14)}}</ref> Thus an astute partner can read much more than the surface meaning into the bidding. Alternatively, many partnerships play this same bidding sequence as \"Crawling Stayman\" by which the responder shows a weak hand (less than eight high card points) with shortness in diamonds but at least four hearts and four spades; the opening bidder may correct to spades if that appears to be the better contract.\n\nThe situations detailed here are extremely simple examples; many instances of advanced bidding involve specific agreements related to very specific situations and subtle inferences regarding entire sequences of calls.\n\n===Play techniques===\n{{Main|List of play techniques (bridge)}}\n\n[[Terence Reese]], a prolific author of bridge books, points out{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:\n* playing a high card that no one else can beat\n* trumping an opponent's high card\n* establishing long suits (the last cards in a suit will take tricks if the opponents don't have the suit and are unable to trump)\n* playing for the opponents' high cards to be in a particular position (if their ace is to the right of your king, your king may be able to take a trick, especially if, when that suit is led, the player to your right has to play their card before you do)\n\nNearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods. The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience and is the subject of whole books on bridge.\n\n==Example==\nThe cards are dealt as shown in the bridge hand [[contract bridge diagram|diagram]]; North is the dealer and starts the auction which proceeds as shown in the bidding table.\n{{BridgeHandNWES\n|Label = Example 1<br>Matchpoints<br>South in 4{{hearts}}<br>Not Vulnerable\n|J&thinsp;3|J&thinsp;8&thinsp;7&thinsp;4|A&thinsp;10&thinsp;7&thinsp;6&thinsp;5|Q&thinsp;3\n|K&thinsp;Q&thinsp;8&thinsp;7&thinsp;2|A&thinsp;2|J&thinsp;4&thinsp;2|10&thinsp;7&thinsp;2\n|10&thinsp;9&thinsp;5&thinsp;4|9&thinsp;6|K&thinsp;Q&thinsp;9|K&thinsp;9&thinsp;6&thinsp;4\n|A&thinsp;6|K&thinsp;Q&thinsp;10&thinsp;5&thinsp;3|8&thinsp;3|A&thinsp;J&thinsp;8&thinsp;5\n|Lead = Lead: {{spades}}&thinsp;K\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:10px; margin-right:10px;\"\n|-\n!West||North||East||South\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| ||Pass||Pass||1{{Hearts}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|1{{Spades}}||2{{Hearts}}||2{{Spades}}||3{{Clubs}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Pass||4{{Hearts}}||Pass||Pass\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Pass|| || ||\n|}\nAs neither North nor East have sufficient strength to ''open'' the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. South, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1{{Hearts}}, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the [[bidding system]]) and at least 12 [[hand evaluation|high card points]]. On this hand, South has 14 high card points. West ''[[overcall]]s'' with 1{{Spades}}, since he has a long spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid). North ''supports'' partner's suit with 2{{Hearts}}, showing heart support and about {{nowrap|6-8}} points. East supports spades with 2{{Spades}}. South inserts a ''[[game try]]'' of 3{{Clubs}}, ''inviting'' the partner to bid the ''game'' of 4{{Hearts}} with good club support and overall values. North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2{{Hearts}} bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2{{Hearts}} bid promised only three), and the ''doubleton'' queen of clubs to fit with partner's strength there. (North could instead have bid 3{{Hearts}}, indicating not enough strength for game, asking South to pass and so play 3{{Hearts}}.)\n\nIn the auction, North-South are trying to investigate whether their cards are sufficient to make a '''game''' (nine tricks at notrump, ten tricks in hearts or spades, 11 tricks in clubs or diamonds), which yields bonus points if bid and made. East-West are ''competing'' in spades, hoping to play a contract in spades at a low level. 4{{Hearts}} is the final contract, 10 tricks being required for N-S to make with hearts as trump.\n\nSouth is the ''declarer'', having been first to bid hearts, and the player to South's left, West, has to choose the first card in the play, known as the ''opening lead''. West chooses the spade king because spades is the suit the partnership has shown strength in, and because they have agreed that when they hold two ''touching honors'' (or ''adjacent honors'') they will play the higher one first. West plays the card face down, to give their partner and the declarer (but not dummy) a chance to ask any last questions about the bidding or to object if they believe West is not the correct hand to lead. After that, North's cards are laid on the table and North becomes ''dummy'', as both the North and South hands will be controlled by the declarer. West turns the lead card face up, and the declarer studies the two hands to make a plan for the play. On this hand, the trump ace, a spade, and a diamond trick must be lost, so declarer must not lose a trick in clubs.\n\nIf the {{Clubs}}K is held by West, South will find it very hard to prevent it from making a trick (unless West leads a club). However, there is an almost-equal chance that it is held by East, in which case it can be 'trapped' against the ace, and will be beaten, using a tactic known as a ''[[finesse]]''.\n\nAfter considering the cards, the declarer directs dummy (North) to play a small spade. East plays ''low'' (small card) and South takes the {{Spades}}A, gaining the ''lead''. (South may also elect to ''[[duck (bridge)|duck]]'', but for the purpose of this example, let us assume South wins the {{Spades}}A at trick 1). South proceeds by ''drawing trump'', leading the {{Hearts}}K. West decides there is no benefit to holding back, and so wins the trick with the ace, and then cashes the {{Spades}}Q. For fear of conceding a ''[[Ruff (cards)#ruff and discard|ruff and discard]]'', West plays the {{Diams}}2 instead of another spade. Declarer plays low from the table, and East scores the {{Diams}}Q. Not having anything better to do, East returns the remaining trump, taken in South's hand. The trumps now accounted for, South can now execute the finesse, perhaps trapping the king as planned. South ''enters'' the dummy (i.e. wins a trick in the dummy's hand) by leading a low diamond, using dummy's {{Diams}}A to win the trick, and leads the {{Clubs}}Q from dummy to the next trick. East ''covers'' the queen with the king, and South takes the trick with the ace, and proceeds by ''cashing'' the remaining ''master'' {{Clubs}}J. (If East doesn't play the king, then South will play a low club from South's hand and the queen will win anyway, this being the essence of the finesse). The game is now safe: South ''[[ruff (cards)|ruffs]]'' a small club with a dummy's trump, then ruffs a diamond in hand for an ''entry'' back, and ruffs the last club in dummy (sometimes described as a ''[[crossruff]]''). Finally, South ''claims'' the remaining tricks by showing his or her hand, as it now contains only high trumps and there's no need to play the hand out to prove they are all winners.\n\n(The trick-by-trick notation used above can be also expressed in tabular form, but a textual explanation is usually preferred in practice, for reader's convenience. Plays of small cards or ''discards'' are often omitted from such a description, unless they were important for the outcome).\n\nNorth-South score the required 10 tricks, and their opponents take the remaining three. The contract is fulfilled, and North enters the pair numbers, the contract, and the score of +420 for the winning side (North is in charge of bookkeeping in duplicate tournaments) on the [[traveling sheet]]. North asks East to check the score entered on the traveller. All players return their own cards to the board, and the next deal is played.\n\nOn the prior hand, it is quite possible that the {{Clubs}}K is held by West. For example, by swapping the {{Clubs}}K and {{Hearts}}A between the defending hands. Then the 4{{Hearts}} contract would fail by one trick (unless West had led a club early in the play). However the failure of the contract would not mean that 4{{Hearts}} is a bad contract on this hand. The contract depends on the club finesse working, or a mis-defense. The bonus points awarded for making a game contract far outweigh the penalty for going one off, so it is best strategy in the long run to bid game contracts such as this one.\n\nSimilarly, there is a minuscule chance that the {{Clubs}}K is in the west hand, but the west hand has no other clubs. In that case, declarer can succeed by simply cashing the {{Clubs}}A, felling the {{Clubs}}K and setting up the {{Clubs}}Q as a winner. However the chance of this is far lower than the simple chance of approximately 50% that East started with the {{Clubs}}K. Therefore, the superior ''percentage'' play is to take the club finesse, as described above.\n\n==Computer bridge==\n{{Main|Computer bridge}}\n\n===User-based play===\nAfter many years of little progress, [[computer bridge]] made great progress at the end of the 20th century. In 1996, the [[American Contract Bridge League|ACBL]] initiated official World Championships Computer Bridge, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first Computer Bridge Championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].\n\nStrong bridge playing programs such as Jack (World Champion in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009), Wbridge5 (World Champion in 2005, 2007 and 2008), RoboBridge<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RoboBridge.com |title=RoboBridge |publisher=RoboBridge |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref> and many-time finalist Bridge Baron, would probably rank among the top few thousand human pairs worldwide. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine [[List of significant bridge books and magazines|IMP]] describes matches between Jack and seven top Dutch pairs. A total of 196 boards were played. Overall, the program Jack lost, but by a small margin (359 versus 385 imps).\n\n===Internet-based play===\nThere are several free and subscription-based services available for playing bridge on the [[internet]]. For example:\n* OKbridge<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okbridge.com/|title=Bridge Online Play Bridge Game On Line - OKbridge|author=|date=|work=okbridge.com|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> is the oldest of the still-running internet bridge services: was established as a commercial enterprise in 1994, but the program started to be used interactively in August 1990 on players of all standards. Beginners to world class may be found playing there.<ref name=OEB7>Manley et al. (2011), p. 597</ref> OKbridge is a subscription-based club, with services such as customer support and ethics reviews.\n* SWAN Games<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swangames.com/main/index.html|title=Online Bridge|author=|date=|work=swangames.com|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> was founded April, 2000. In March 2004, announced a partnership to provide internet services to SBF members and is a competitor in subscription-based online bridge clubs.<ref name=OEB7/>\n* [[Bridge Base Online]] (BBO) is the most active online bridge club in the world, with more than 100 000 daily connections and 500 000 hands played each day,<ref name=OEB7/> in part because it is free to play regular games and volunteer-run tournaments.\n\nThese and other sites offer various features, such as opportunities to earn [[American Contract Bridge League|ACBL]] masterpoints, to play in online tournaments, to compile lists of friends, and to earn money playing Bridge. Bridge Base Online also has a [[Vugraph]] feature showing tournaments from around the world for anyone interested to watch live. As well as written commentaries from top level players, voice commentaries have been incorporated since mid-2011. Software and hardware has been tested in 2011 in order to have digital cameras recognize the cards being played, which will avoid human error or delay.\n\nSome national contract bridge organizations now offer online bridge play to their members, including the English Bridge Union, the [[Dutch Bridge Federation]] and the Australian Bridge Federation. MSN and Yahoo! Games have several online rubber bridge rooms. In 2001, the [[World Bridge Federation|WBF]] issued a special edition of the lawbook adapted for internet and other electronic forms of the game.\n\nAdvantages of online play include:\n* The software prevents improper plays and calls, such as insufficient bids, [[revoke]]s (failure to follow suit when able), and actions out of turn.\n* Unauthorised information cannot be passed by [[Nonverbal communication|tone of voice]] or [[body language]] (but can much more easily be passed by external communication).\n* Detailed records are kept which can aid partners to review and improve their bidding and play.\n* Hands can be easily be analysed for best play ([[double dummy]]) afterwards.\n* Can play with partners far away - or across town.\n* No need to assemble 4 people in one place.\n* Faster play - no shifting chairs or waiting for shuffles.\n* Player rating systems may attempt to measure ability without regard to the number of games played or the number of years spent accumulating [[masterpoints]].\n* Fewer restrictions on the conventions that are permitted compared to club tourneys.\n* Easy to find opponents for practice in bidding and playing.\n* You will meet bridge players from every country and time zone.\n* Flexibility when to play (24/7), and choice of opponent skill level.\n* Choice of individual, pairs, or team competitions.\n* Fun to watch famous bridge stars play \"live\" as well as well-known personalities such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett (who used to appear regularly on OKBridge in set games)\n\nThere are also a number of disadvantages:\n* Inability to decide on bidding convention ahead of time when partners are strangers.\n* A reduced social element.\n* Players may leave before a hand finishes, or in the middle of a planned session, either intentionally or because of connection difficulties.\n\nTournaments are usually shorter online. A common length is 12 boards (deals). Online services support many simultaneous tournaments. When you finish one tournament, another will start soon.\n\nSome online services like BBO have apps for [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bridgebase.BridgeBase&hl=en Android] and [http://itunes.com/apps/bridgebase iPhone].\n\n==Film==\nBridge has appeared in the following films,\n* ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[The Sleeping Cardinal]]'' (1931)\n* ''[[Grand Slam (1933 film)|Grand Slam]]'' (1933)\n* ''[[Here Come the Co-Eds]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947)\n* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)\n* ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953)\n* ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962)\n* ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979)\n\n==TV Series==\n* [[Meteor Garden (2018 TV series)|Meteor Garden]] - F4's challenge is Contract Bridge, in which each of them had techniques.\n\n==Card games related to bridge==\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[500 (card game)|500]]\n* [[Bridgette (game)|Bridgette]]\n* [[Euchre]]\n* [[King (card game)|King]]\n* [[Lanterloo]]\n* Lost Heir\n* [[Napoleon (card game)|Nap]]\n* [[Ombre]]\n* [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]]\n* [[Rex Bridge]] (includes all features of Contract Bridge and more)\n* [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]\n* [[Spades]]\n* [[Spoil Five]]\n* [[Whist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Glossary of contract bridge terms]]\n* [[List of bridge books]]\n* [[List of bridge competitions and awards]]\n* [[List of bridge magazines]]\n* [[List of contract bridge people]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|author1=[[American Contract Bridge League]]|title=Laws of Duplicate Bridge|url=http://cdn.acbl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Laws-of-Duplicate-Bridge.pdf|ref=duplicatelaws|format=PDF|date=2016|location=[[Horn Lake, Mississippi|Horn Lake, MS]]}}\n* {{cite web|author1=[[American Contract Bridge League]]|title=Laws of Rubber Bridge|url=http://cdn.acbl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Laws-of-Rubber-Bridge.pdf|ref=rubberlaws|format=PDF|date=2014|location=[[Horn Lake, Mississippi|Horn Lake, MS]]}}\n* {{OEB|6}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Walter B. |title=Hoyle's Modern Encyclopedia of Card Games: Rules of All the Basic Games and Popular Variations |date=1974 |publisher=Dolphin Books |location=[[Garden City, New York|Garden City, NY]] |isbn=978-0385076807 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last = Kantar |first = Eddie |authorlink = Eddie Kantar |title = Bridge for Dummies |edition=3rd |publisher =[[John Wiley & Sons]] |series= |year= 2012 |doi= |isbn= 978-1-118-24083-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{OEB|7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further|List of bridge books}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikicommons|Contract bridge}}\n* [http://www.worldbridge.org/home.asp World Bridge Federation (WBF)]\n* [http://www.acbl.org/ American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title= [[File:Nuvola apps kpdf2.png|25px]] Topics related to Contract bridge\n|state=off\n|list1=</span>\n{{WPCBIndex}}\n{{Trick-taking card games}}\n{{French deck card games}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Contract Bridge}}\n[[Category:Contract bridge| ]]\n[[Category:Anglo-American card games]]\n[[Category:Four-player card games]]\n[[Category:Games of mental skill]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Trick-taking card games]]\n[[Category:French deck card games]]\n[[Category:Card games introduced in 1925]]", "sha1": "783w5bisrjvotmbukcczsuboh9ypbo9"}}, {"title": "Boat", "ns": "0", "id": "3996", "revision": {"id": "865131330", "parentid": "858889071", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T23:23:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Sam.hill7", "id": "20344300"}, "comment": "added electric to propulsion", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{distinguish|Ship}}\n[[File:Motorboat at Kankaria lake.JPG|thumb|right|A recreational [[motorboat]] with an [[outboard motor]]]]\n\nA '''boat''' is a [[watercraft]] of a large range of type and size. [[Ship]]s are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape, and cargo or passenger capacity.\n\nSmall boats are typically found on inland waterways such as [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the [[whaleboat]], were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.  Anomalous definitions exist, as bulk freighters {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long on the [[Great Lakes]] being known as [[lake freighter|oreboats]]. \n\nBoats vary in proportion and construction methods due to their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. [[Canoe]]s have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. [[Fishing boat]]s vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. [[Pleasure boat|Pleasure craft]] used in  [[boating|recreational boating]] include ski boats, [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon boats]], and [[sailboat]]s. [[House boat]]s may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. [[Lighter (barge)|Lighters]] are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|Lifeboat]]s have rescue and safety functions. \n\nBoats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. [[rowboat]]s and [[pedalo|paddle boats]]), wind  (e.g. [[sailboat]]s), and motor (including [[gasoline]],[[diesel engine|diesel]], and electric).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Do\u0142banka.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] (dowbanka) dating from the end of the 19th century at [[Radomysl Castle]], [[Ukraine]]<ref>Bogomolets O.

Unpowered craft include [[raft]]s meant for one-way downstream travel. Human-powered boats include [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[gondola]]s and boats propelled by poles like a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].\n# [[Sailboat]]s, propelled mainly by means of [[sail]]s.\n# [[Motorboat]]s, propelled by mechanical means, such as [[engine]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\n{{details|Glossary of nautical terms}}\nThe [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the main, and in some cases only, structural component of a boat.  It provides both capacity and [[buoyancy]]. The [[keel]] is a boat's \"backbone\", a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed. On most boats a [[deck (ship)|deck]] covers the hull, in part or whole. While a [[ship]] often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one. Above the deck are often [[Lifeline (safety)|lifelines]] connected to [[stanchion]]s, [[bulwark]]s perhaps topped by [[Gunnel (ship element)|gunnel]]s, or some combination of the two. A [[cabin (ship)|cabin]] may protrude above the deck forward, aft, along the centerline, or covering much of the length of the boat. Vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.\n\nThe forward end of a boat is called the [[bow (ship)|bow]], the aft end the [[stern]]. Facing forward the right side is referred to as [[starboard]] and the left side as [[Port and starboard|port]].\n\n== Building materials ==\n{{see also|Boat building}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|Traditional Toba [[Batak]] boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]]]]\n[[File:Boats at Bhimili beach in Visakhapatnam.jpg|thumb|Fishing Boats in [[Visakhapatnam]], India]]\n\nUntil the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although [[Reed (plant)|reed]], bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the [[birch bark]] [[canoe]], the animal hide-covered [[kayak]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Streever |first= Bill |title= Cold: Adventures in the World's Frozen Places |location= New York |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |year= 2009 |page= 154}}</ref> and [[coracle]] and the [[dugout canoe]] made from a single log.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name \"ferciment\". This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. These materials and methods were copied all over the world and have faded in and out of popularity to the present time. \n\nAs the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the [[Bessemer process]] ([[patent]]ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel remain uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world's largest producer of pleasure boats. \n\nMullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and once again in the 1920s, <ref>WH Mullins boat history, Salem Ohio</ref>{{ref}} but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that [[aluminium]] gained widespread popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.\n\nAround the mid-1960s, boats made of [[fiberglass]] (glass-reinforced plastic) became popular, especially for recreational boats. The [[United States Coast Guard]] refers to these as 'FRP' (for fiber-reinforced plastic) boats. Fiberglass boats are strong, and do not rust, corrode, or rot. Instead, they are susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. FRP structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the FRP encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam. \n\nCold moulding is similar to FRP in using epoxy or polyester resins, but substitutes wood for fibreglass as the structural component. In cold moulding very thin strips of wood are layered over a form. Each layer is coated with resin, followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top. Subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous, or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets.\n\n==Propulsion==\n{{See also|Marine propulsion}}\nThe most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:\n* Engine\n** [[Inboard motor]]\n** [[Stern drive]] (Inboard/outboard)\n** [[Outboard motor]]\n** [[Paddle wheel]]\n** Water jet ([[jetboat]], [[personal water craft]])\n** Fan ([[hovercraft]], [[air boat]])\n* Man ([[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[Watercraft paddling|paddling]], [[setting pole]] etc.)\n* Wind ([[Sails|sail]]ing)\n\n==Buoyancy==\n{{Main|Buoyancy}}\n\nA boat [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] its weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete.  If weight is added to the boat, the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal.  Boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy.  Exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water, second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded, and ultimately, if overloaded by any combination of structure, cargo, and water, sink.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Canoe-01.jpg|Injection-molded plastic boat\nFile:Yacht and Sails.JPG|Anchored boats in [[Portovenere]], Italy\nFile:BOUALAML.the boat south mediterranean-Maghrebis.2.jpg|A wooden boat in Morocco\nFile:lifeboat.17-31.underway.arp.jpg|At 17 metres long, the [[Severn-class lifeboat|Severn-class]]s are the largest [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] in the UK\nFile:EgyptTombOarboat.jpg|A boat in an Egyptian tomb, painted around 1450 BC\nFile:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|[[Dugout (boat)|Dugout boats]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]\nFile: A boat in India.JPG|A boat on the [[Ganges River]]\nFile: Babur crossing the river Son.jpg|Babur crossing river Son; folio from an illustrated manuscript of \u2018Babur-Namah\u2019, Mughal, [[Akbar]] Period, AD 1598\nFile: Tug Boat NY 1.jpg|A [[tugboat]] is used for towing or pushing another larger [[ship]]\nor [[barge]]\nFile:Oldboats.JPG|Aluminum [[flat-bottomed boat]]s ashore for storage\nFile:DerelictBoatFollyIs.jpg|A ship's derelict [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]], built of steel, rusting away in the wetlands of [[Folly Island]], [[South Carolina]], United States\nFile:The boat south mediterranean-Maghrebis.jpg|A wooden boat In a small Moroccan village\nFile: Boating in fair weather.jpg|A wooden boat operating near shore\nFile:Jiajing Emperor on his state barge.jpg|[[Ming Dynasty]] Chinese painting of the [[Wanli Emperor]] enjoying a boat ride on a river with an entourage of guards and courtiers\nFile:Sauce Bottle - geograph.org.uk - 13422.jpg|A boat shaped like a sauce bottle that was sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by [[Tom McClean]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Abora]]\n* [[Barge]]\n* [[Cabin cruiser]]\n* [[Dory]]\n* [[Fishing boat]]\n* [[Halkett boat]]\n* [[Inflatable boat]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Launch (boat)]]\n* [[Log canoe]]\n* [[Narrowboat]]\n* [[Naval architecture]]\n* [[Panga (boat)]]\n* [[Pirogue]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Rescue craft]]\n* [[Sampan]]\n* [[Ship's boat]]\n* [[Skiff]]\n* [[Yacht]]\n* [[Traditional fishing boats]]\n* [[Watercraft rowing]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n{{Wikiquote|Boats}}\n{{Wiktionary|boat}}\n* University of Washington Libraries Digital Collections \u2013 [http://content.lib.washington.edu/fishweb/index.html Freshwater and Marine Image Bank], (enter search term \"vessels\" for images of boats and vessels.)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Boats| ]]\n[[Category:Watercraft]]\n[[Category:Fishing equipment]]", "sha1": "d9izyvnf3othjl35wdef074oaklk1f6"}}, {"title": "Blood", "ns": "0", "id": "3997", "revision": {"id": "864616949", "parentid": "864580859", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T11:33:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "CV9933", "id": "23856855"}, "comment": "CS1 maint - template details.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox anatomy\n|Name    = Blood\n|Latin   = haema\n|Image   = Venous and arterial blood.jpg\n|Caption = Venous (darker) and arterial (brighter) blood\n}}\n\n'''Blood''' is a [[body fluid]] in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as [[nutrient]]s and [[oxygen]] to the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and transports [[metabolic waste]] products away from those same cells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blood |title=Definition of BLOOD |publisher= |accessdate=4 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323030751/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blood |archivedate=23 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[vertebrate]]s, it is composed of [[blood cell]]s suspended in [[blood plasma]].

[[Albumin]] is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal [[osmotic pressure]] of blood. The blood cells are mainly [[red blood cell]]s (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), [[white blood cell]]s (also called WBCs or leukocytes)  and [[platelet]]s (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain [[hemoglobin]], an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this [[Breath|respiratory]] gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as [[bicarbonate]] ion transported in plasma.\n\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusk]]s, use [[hemocyanin]] to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. Insects and some mollusks use a fluid called [[hemolymph]] instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed [[circulatory system]]. In most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] to suffice for supplying oxygen.\n\n[[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] have an [[adaptive immune system]], based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the [[Coagulation|clotting]] of blood. [[Arthropod]]s, using hemolymph, have [[hemocyte]]s as part of their [[immune system]].\n\nBlood is circulated around the body through [[blood vessel]]s by the pumping action of the [[heart]]. In animals with [[lung]]s, [[artery|arterial]] blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and [[vein|venous]] blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of [[metabolism]] produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.\n\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with '''hemo-''' or '''hemato-''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''haemo-''' and '''haemato-''') from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1}} (''haima'') for \"blood\". In terms of [[anatomy]] and [[histology]], blood is considered a specialized form of [[connective tissue]], given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of [[fibrinogen]].\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|right|thumb|Hemoglobin, a globular protein<br />green = haem (or heme) groups<br />red & blue = protein subunits]]\n[[File:Heme.svg|right|thumb|Heme]]\nBlood performs many important functions within the body, including:\n* Supply of [[oxygen]] to tissues (bound to [[hemoglobin]], which is carried in red cells)\n* Supply of nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, and [[fatty acid]]s (dissolved in the blood or bound to [[Blood proteins|plasma proteins]] (e.g., [[blood lipid]]s))\n* Removal of waste such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[urea]], and [[lactic acid]]\n* Immunological functions, including circulation of [[white blood cell]]s, and detection of foreign material by [[Antibody|antibodies]]\n* [[Coagulation]], the response to a broken blood vessel, the conversion of blood from a liquid to a semisolid gel to stop bleeding\n* Messenger functions, including the transport of [[hormone]]s and the signaling of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage\n* Regulation of core [[body temperature]]\n* [[Hydraulics|Hydraulic]] functions\n\n==Constituents==\n===In mammals===\n{{See also|Reference ranges for common blood tests}}\n[[File:Whats Inside of Blood.webm|thumb|left|What's Inside of Blood]]\nBlood accounts for 7% of the human body weight,<ref name=\"alberts_table\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26919/table/A4143/ |title=Table 22-1 Blood Cells |accessdate=1 November 2012 |publisher=NCBI Bookshelf |year=2012 |author=Alberts, Bruce |website=Molecular Biology of the Cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327160412/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26919/table/A4143/ |archivedate=27 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"PhysFactVol\">{{Cite web |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/LanNaLee.shtml |title=Volume of Blood in a Human |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BqsfDDSK?url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/LanNaLee.shtml |archivedate=1 November 2012 |year=2012 |author1=Elert, Glenn |others=his students |website=The Physics Factbook |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> with an average density around 1060&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, very close to pure water's density of 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/MichaelShmukler.shtml |title=Density of Blood |accessdate=4 October 2006 |year=2004 |website=The Physics Factbook |last=Shmukler |first=Michael |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919051122/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/MichaelShmukler.shtml |archivedate=19 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The average adult has a [[blood volume]] of roughly {{convert|5|L|USpt|lk=in}},<ref name=\"PhysFactVol\"/> which is composed of plasma and several kinds of cells.

In humans, blood is pumped from the strong [[left ventricle]] of the heart through [[artery|arteries]] to peripheral [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and returns to the right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium of the heart]] through [[vein]]s. It then enters the right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the [[lung]]s and returns to the left atrium through the [[pulmonary vein]]s. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and [[venous blood]] carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of [[metabolism]] by [[Cell (biology)|cells]], to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n\nAdditional return flow may be generated by the movement of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the [[right atrium]].\n\nThe blood circulation was famously described by [[William Harvey]] in 1628.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus |url=http://www.rarebookroom.org/Control/hvyexc/index.html |first=William |last=Harvey |authorlink=William Harvey |language=Latin |year=1628 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127002138/http://rarebookroom.org/Control/hvyexc/index.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Production and degradation of blood cells===\nIn vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the [[bone marrow]] in a process called [[hematopoiesis]], which includes [[erythropoiesis]], the production of red blood cells; and [[myelopoiesis]], the production of white blood cells and platelets.

Respiratory physiology \u00a7 Transport of carbon dioxide in blood)}}</ref>\nHemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO<sub>2</sub> bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the [[Haldane effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n===Transport of hydrogen ions===\nSome oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.\n\n===Lymphatic system===\n{{main|Lymphatic system}}\nIn mammals, blood is in equilibrium with [[lymph]], which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the [[thoracic duct]], which drains into the left [[subclavian vein]] where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.\n\n===Thermoregulation===\nBlood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of [[thermoregulation]]. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.\n\n=== Rate of blood flow ===\nRate of blood flow varies greatly between different organs. Liver has the most abundant blood supply with an approximate flow of 1350 ml/min. Kidney and brain are the second and the third most supplied organs, with 1100 ml/min and ~700 ml/min, respectively.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology |last= |first= |publisher=Saunders |year=2015 |isbn=978-1455770052 |location= |pages=204}}</ref>\n\nRelative rates of blood flow per 100 g of tissue are different, with kidney, adrenal gland and thyroid being the first, second and third most supplied tissues, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Hydraulic functions===\nThe restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an [[erection]] of that tissue; examples are the [[erectile tissue]] in the [[penis]] and [[clitoris]].\n\nAnother example of a hydraulic function is the [[jumping spider]], in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-559817/spider |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica online |title=Spiders: circulatory system |accessdate=25 November 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112190558/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-559817/spider |archivedate=12 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Invertebrates===\nIn insects, the blood (more properly called [[hemolymph]]) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called [[Trachea#Invertebrates|tracheae]] allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues.) Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.\n\nOther invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. [[Hemocyanin]] (blue) contains copper and is found in [[crustacean]]s and [[Mollusca|mollusks]]. It is thought that [[tunicate]]s (sea squirts) might use [[vanabins]] (proteins containing [[vanadium]]) for [[respiratory pigment]] (bright-green, blue, or orange).\n\nIn many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing [[viscosity]] or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.\n\n[[Giant tube worm]]s have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.\n\n==Color==\nThe coloring matter of blood ('''hemochrome''') is largely due to the protein in the blood responsible for oxygen transport.  Different groups of organisms use different proteins.\n\n===Hemoglobin===\n{{main|Hemoglobin}}\n[[File:Bleeding finger.jpg|thumb|Capillary blood from a bleeding finger]]\nHemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In [[vertebrate]]s and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during [[blood donation]] and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states.<ref>{{cite web |last=Prahl |title=Optical Absorption of Hemoglobin |url=http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/hemoglobin/ |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105184047/http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/hemoglobin/ |archivedate=5 January 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBlood in [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] is bright red, because [[carbon monoxide]] causes the formation of [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. In [[cyanide]] poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue\u2014a symptom called [[cyanosis]]. If the heme is oxidized, [[methemoglobin]], which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue.\n\nVeins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of [[visual perception|color perception]] are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the [[visual cortex]], rather than the actual color of the venous blood.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kienle |first=Alwin |authorlink= |author2=Lothar Lilge |author3=I.

These proteins are based on vanadium, and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water. Unlike hemocyanin and hemoglobin, hemovanadin is not an oxygen carrier. When exposed to oxygen, however, vanadins turn a mustard yellow.\n\n==Pathology==\n\n===General medical disorders===\n* Disorders of volume\n** Injury can cause blood loss through bleeding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/blood/blood.html |title=Blood \u2013 The Human heart |publisher=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=19 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305043654/http://www.fi.edu/learn/heart/blood/blood.html |archivedate=5 March 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1&nbsp;L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume (2&nbsp;L) before [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] sets in. [[Thrombocyte]]s are important for blood [[coagulation]] and the formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause [[internal bleeding]], which can sometimes be severe.\n** [[Dehydration]] can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood. This would rarely result in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in [[orthostatic hypotension]] and [[fainting]].\n* Disorders of circulation\n** Shock is the ineffective [[perfusion]] of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss, infection, poor [[cardiac output]].\n** [[Atherosclerosis]] reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], excess circulating lipids ([[hyperlipidemia]]), and [[diabetes mellitus]].\n** Coagulation can form a [[thrombosis]], which can obstruct vessels.\n** Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied. The term ''ischemia'' refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and ''infarction'' refers to tissue death ([[necrosis]]), which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate).\n\n===Hematological disorders===\n{{see also|Hematology}}\n* Anemia\n** Insufficient red cell mass ([[anemia]]) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like [[thalassemia]], or [[Illnesses related to poor nutrition|nutritional deficiencies]], and may require one or more [[blood transfusion]]s. Anemia can also be due to a [[genetic disorder]] in which the red blood cells simply do not function effectively. Anemia can be confirmed by a [[blood test]] if the hemoglobin value is less than 13.5 gm/dl in men or less than 12.0 gm/dl in women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Anemia/ |title=The Role of Red Blood Cells in Anemia |accessdate=2017-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518202410/http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Anemia/ |archivedate=18 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Several countries have [[blood bank]]s to fill the demand for transfusable blood.

This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in [[hemarthrosis]], or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.\n** Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in [[coagulopathy]] (bleeding disorders).\n** Hypercoagulable state ([[thrombophilia]]) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.\n* Infectious disorders of blood\n** Blood is an important vector of infection. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person. [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to [[blood-borne infection]]s, bloodstained objects are treated as a [[Biological hazard|biohazard]].\n** Bacterial infection of the blood is [[bacteremia]] or [[sepsis]]. Viral Infection is viremia. [[Malaria]] and [[trypanosomiasis]] are blood-borne parasitic infections.\n\n===Carbon monoxide poisoning===\n{{main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}\nSubstances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Ivan|date=2001|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281520/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270\u2013272|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1281520|pmid=11387414}}</ref>\n\n==Medical treatments==\n\n===Blood products===\n{{further|Blood transfusion}}\n[[File:Bloodbags.jpg|thumb|Venous blood collected during blood donation]]\nBlood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a [[blood bank]]. There are many different [[blood type]]s in humans, the [[ABO blood group system]], and the [[Rhesus blood group system]] being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so [[crossmatching]] is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.\n\nOther blood products administered [[intravenous]]ly are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.\n\n===Intravenous administration===\nMany forms of medication (from [[antibiotic]]s to [[chemotherapy]]) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.\n\nAfter severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl<sub>2</sub> etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, [[human serum albumin]], or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.\n\n===Bloodletting===\n{{main|bloodletting}}\nIn modern [[evidence-based medicine]], bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including [[hemochromatosis]] and [[polycythemia]]. However, [[bloodletting]] and [[Hirudotherapy|leeching]] were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] medicine.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Jan Jansk\u00fd, 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] is credited with the first classification of blood into four types (A, B, AB, and O)]]\nAccording to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the word \"blood\" dates to the oldest English, circa 1000&nbsp;CE. The word is derived from Middle English, which is derived from the Old English word ''bl\u00f4d'', which is akin to the Old High German word ''bluot'', meaning blood. The modern German word is ''(das) Blut.''\n\n==History==\n===Classical Greek medicine===\n[[F\u00e5hr\u00e6us]] (a Swedish physician who devised the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of [[humorism]], wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the \"black bile\"). Above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the \"blood\"). Above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the \"phlegm\"). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the \"yellow bile\").<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hart GD |title=Descriptions of blood and blood disorders before the advent of laboratory studies |journal=Br. J.

[[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first [[blood transfusion]] was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility.<ref>http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/history-blood-transfusion{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.\n\n==Cultural and religious beliefs==\n{{See also|Blood libel}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\n\nDue to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendence, rather than marriage. This bears closely to [[bloodline]]s, and sayings such as \"[[blood is thicker than water]]\" and \"[[wikt:bad blood|bad blood]]\", as well as \"[[Blood brother]]\".\n\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions, because [[Leviticus]] 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\" This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.\n\nMythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.\n\n===Indigenous Australians===\nIn many [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples']] traditions, [[ochre]] (particularly red) and blood, both high in iron content and considered [[Maban]], are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:<blockquote>\nIn many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lawlor, Robert |title=Voices of the first day: awakening in the Aboriginal dreamtime |publisher=Inner Traditions International |location=Rochester, Vt |year=1991 |pages=102\u201303 |isbn=978-0-89281-355-1}}</ref></blockquote> Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and [[magnetic field]]s, because iron is [[magnetism|magnetic]].\n\n===European paganism===\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2012}}\nAmong the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], blood was used during their sacrifices; the ''[[Bl\u00f3t]]s''. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called ''bl\u00f3edsian'' in [[Old English language|Old English]], and the terminology was borrowed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] becoming ''to bless'' and ''blessing''. The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] word for blood, ''ishar'' was a cognate to words for \"oath\" and \"bond\", see [[Ishara]].\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] believed that the blood of the gods, ''[[ichor]]'', was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.\n\nAs a relic of Germanic Law, the [[cruentation]], an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.\n\n===Christianity===\nIn [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9:4, God prohibited [[Noah]] and his sons from eating blood (see [[Noahide Law]]). This command continued to be observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox]].\n\nIt is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway.\n\nAt the [[Council of Jerusalem]], the [[apostles]] prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood\u2014this is documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19\u201321): It was to avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.\n\nChrist's blood is the means for the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of sins. Also, \u2033\u2026 the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son cleanseth us from all sin.\" (1 John 1:7), \u201c\u2026 Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.\" (Revelation 1:5), and \"And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood\nof the Lamb [Jesus the Christ], and by the word of their testimony \u2026\u201d (Revelation 12:11).\n\nSome Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] teach that, when consecrated, the [[Eucharist]]ic wine [[transubstantiation|actually becomes]] the [[Blood of Christ|blood of Jesus]] for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in [[the Last Supper]], as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which Jesus stated to his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]] that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. ''\"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke |chapter=22|verse=20}})''.\n\nMost forms of Protestantism, especially those of a [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] or [[Presbyterian]] lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. [[Lutheran]] theology teaches that the body and blood is [[consubstantiation|present together \"in, with, and under\"]] the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.\n\n===Judaism===\nIn [[Judaism]], animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish [[diet (nutrition)|dietary]] laws ([[Kashrut]]). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots), [[salting (food)|salting]] and then rinsing with water again several times.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/82678/jewish/Koshering-Meat.htm Koshering Meat.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084120/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/82678/jewish/Koshering-Meat.htm |date=16 December 2013 }} Chabad.org.</ref> Eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113470/jewish/Removing-the-Blood.htm Removing the Blood.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084034/http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113470/jewish/Removing-the-Blood.htm |date=16 December 2013 }} Chabad.org.</ref> Although blood from fish is biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the Biblical prohibition.<ref>Citron, R.

In relation to human beings, [[Kabbalah]] expounds on this verse that the [[animal soul]] of a person is in the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.\n\nLikewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal's blood, the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption.<ref>[[Menachem M. Schneerson|Schneerson, R. Menachem M.]] ''Igrot Kodesh,'' vol. vii, p. 270.</ref>\n\n===Islam===\nConsumption of food containing blood is forbidden by [[Islamic dietary laws]]. This is derived from the statement in the [[Qur'an]], sura [[Al-Ma'ida]] (5:3): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah.\"\n\nBlood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to [[menstruation]], postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal's  neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}\n\nBased on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 (\"Keep abstaining...from blood.\"), many [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 15 June 2004, p. 22, \"Be Guided by the Living God\"</ref>\n\n===East Asian culture===\nIn [[East Asian cultural sphere|south East Asian popular culture]], it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in Chinese-language and Hong Kong films as well as in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Culture of Korea|Korean]] culture parodied in [[anime]], [[manga]], and [[Korean drama|drama]]. Characters, mostly males, will often be shown with a [[epistaxis|nosebleed]] if they have just seen someone [[nude]] or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy; this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused.<ref>Law of Anime No. 40 a.k.a.

Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the '[[Nosferatu]]' legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. [[Ticks]], [[leech]]es, female [[mosquito]]es, [[vampire bat]]s, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are [[new world]] creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===In the applied sciences===\n[[Blood residue]] can help [[forensic]] investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through [[bloodstain pattern analysis]], forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.\n\nBlood residue analysis is also a technique used in [[archeology]].\n\n===In art===\nBlood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art.<ref>[http://artscad.com/A.nsf/Opra/SRVV-6MDNX5 \"Nostalgia\"] Artwork in blood {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108093007/http://artscad.com/A.nsf/Opra/SRVV-6MDNX5 |date=8 January 2009 }}</ref> In particular, the performances of [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionist]] [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Istvan Kantor]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[Ron Athey]], [[Yang Zhichao]], [[Justice Yeldham|Lucas Abela]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]], along with the photography of [[Andres Serrano]], have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. [[Marc Quinn]] has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.\n\n===In genealogy and family history===\nThe term ''blood'' is used in [[Genealogy|genealogical circles]] to refer to one's [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[Human evolution|origins]], and [[Ethnic group|ethnic background]] as in the word ''[[Heredity|bloodline]]''.

Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] which was introduced by him in 1979. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman & Co, 1982; {{isbn|0-7167-1186-9}}</ref> This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"[[Artifact (observational)|program artifacts]]\".\n\n[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 2006]]\n\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension''.<ref>''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; {{isbn|0-7167-0473-0}}</ref> According to computer scientist and physicist [[Stephen Wolfram]], the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics \u2026 to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before.\"<ref name=Wolfram>Wolfram, Stephen.

He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\n{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer \u2026 bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling \u2026 and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|292}}}}\n\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''</blockquote>\n[[File:Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a Mandelbrot set]]\n\nMandelbrot has been called a work of art, and a visionary<ref name=\"RLD\">{{cite web|author=Devaney, Robert L.|authorlink= Robert L.

The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.\n\nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox.

It is heavily influenced by the writings of [[John Cassian]], and shows strong affinity with the [[Rule of the Master]]. But it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness (\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ''epie\u00edkeia''), and this persuaded most religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it. As a result, his Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western [[Christendom]]. For this reason, Benedict is often called the founder of [[Christian monasticism#Western Christian monasticism|Western Christian monasticism]].\n\n==Biography==\nApart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino,<ref>http://www.ampleforthjournal.org/V_027.pdf</ref> the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of [[Pope Gregory&nbsp;I]]'s four-book ''[[Dialogues]]'', thought to have been written in 593.<ref name=ford/> The authenticity of this work has been hotly disputed, especially by Dr Francis Clarke in his two volume work ''The Pseudo-Gregorian Dialogues''. Book Two consists of a prologue and thirty-eight succinct chapters.<ref>''Life and Miracles of St. Benedict'' (''Book II, Dialogues''), translated by Odo John Zimmerman, O.S.B. and Benedict R. Avery, O.S.B. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1980), p. iv.</ref>\n\nGregory's account of this saint's life is not, however, a biography in the modern sense of the word. It provides instead a [[Hagiography|spiritual portrait]] of the gentle, disciplined abbot. In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his ''Dialogues'', saying they are a kind of ''floretum'' (an ''anthology'', literally, 'flowers') of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men.<ref name=\"fn_4\">See Ildephonso Schuster, ''Saint Benedict and His Times'', Gregory J. Roettger, trans. (London: B. Herder, 1951), p. 2.</ref>\n\nGregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of Saint Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony. To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict's disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles. These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as [[Abbot]] of Monte Cassino; Valentinianus; Simplicius; and Honoratus, who was abbot of Subiaco when St Gregory wrote his ''Dialogues''.\n\nIn Gregory's day, history was not recognised as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and ''historia'' (defined as 'story') summed up the approach of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered 'history.'<ref name=\"fn_6\">See Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis, editor, ''Historiography in the Middle Ages'' (Boston: Brill, 2003), pp. 1\u20132.</ref> Gregory's ''Dialogues'' Book Two, then, an authentic medieval hagiography cast as a conversation between the Pope and his deacon Peter, is designed to teach spiritual lessons.<ref name=ford/>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was the son of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] noble of [[Nursia]],<ref name=ford>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02467b.htm Ford, Hugh. \"St. Benedict of Norcia.\" The ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 3 Mar. 2014]</ref> the modern [[Norcia]], in [[Umbria]]. A tradition which [[Bede]] accepts makes him a twin with his sister [[Scholastica]]. If 480 is accepted as the year of his birth, the year of his abandonment of his studies and leaving home would be about 500. Saint Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 20 at the time. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected by the love of a woman. He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a Roman noble; clearly he was not a child.\n\nBenedict was sent to Rome to study, but was dissatisfied by the life he found there. He does not seem to have left Rome for the purpose of becoming a [[hermit]], but only to find some place away from the life of the great city. He took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in [[Enfide]].<ref name=Crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/BENEDICT.htm \"Saint Benedict, Abbot\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref> Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern [[Affile]], is in the [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two from Subiaco.\n\n[[File:Benedetto, Mauro e Placido.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Saint Benedict orders [[Saint Maurus]] to the rescue of [[Saint Placidus]]'', by [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], 1445 A.D.]]\n\nA short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until a cave is reached above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in Saint Benedict's day, {{convert|500|ft|m}} below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep.\nOn his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, [[Romanus of Subiaco]], whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and had given him the monk's habit. By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake.<ref name=SHMI />\n\n==Later life==\nGregory tells us little of these years. He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (''puer''), but as a man (''vir'') of God. [[Romanus of Subiaco|Romanus]], Gregory tells us, served the saint in every way he could. The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.<ref name=Crawley/><!-- Image with questionable fair-use claim removed: [[File:it238th.jpg|right]] -->\n\nDuring these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with [[Vicovaro]]), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that \"their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent\" (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the monks tried to poison him. The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink. He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco. There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who, moved by envy, tried to ruin him. He tried to poison him with poisoned bread. When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a raven swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. Having failed by sending him poisonous bread, Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes. To avoid further temptations, in 530 Benedict left Subiaco. He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco, and, eventually, in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino,<ref name=SHMI /> which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples.<ref>[http://www.benedictine-srs.org/nursia.html Nursia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716220328/http://www.benedictine-srs.org/nursia.html |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the invasion of Italy, [[Totila]], King of the [[Ostrogoths|Goths]], ordered a general to wear his kingly robes and to see whether Benedict would discover the truth.

In 1647, during a witchcraft trial at [[Natternberg]] near [[Metten Abbey]] in Bavaria, the accused women testified they had no power over Metten, which was under the protection of the cross. An investigation found a number of painted crosses on the walls of the abbey with the letters now found on St Benedict medals, but their meaning had been forgotten. A manuscript written in 1415 was eventually found that had a picture of Saint Benedict holding a scroll in one hand and a staff which ended in a cross in the other. On the scroll and staff were written the full words of the initials contained on the crosses. Medals then began to be struck in Germany, which then spread throughout Europe.

On 9 August 48 BC at [[Pharsalus]] in central Greece, [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] and his allies formed up opposite the army of the [[Roman Republic|republic]] under the command of [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (\"Pompey the Great\"). Pompey had the backing of a majority of the [[Roman Senate|senators]], of whom many were [[optimate]]s, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.\n\nThe two armies confronted each other over several months of uncertainty, Caesar being in a much weaker position than Pompey.\nThe former found himself isolated in a hostile country with only 22,000 men and short of provisions, while on the other side of the river he was faced by Pompey with an army about twice as large in number. Pompey wanted to delay, knowing the enemy would eventually surrender from hunger and exhaustion. Pressured by the senators present and by his officers, he reluctantly engaged in battle and suffered an overwhelming defeat, ultimately fleeing the camp and his men, disguised as an ordinary citizen.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nA dispute between Caesar and the ''optimates'' faction in the Senate of Rome culminated in Caesar marching his army on Rome and forcing Pompey, accompanied by much of the [[Roman Senate]], to flee in 49 BC from Italy to Greece, where he could better conscript an army to face his former ally. Caesar, lacking a fleet to immediately give chase, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean \u2013 Spain specifically \u2013 before assembling ships to follow Pompey. [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], whom Pompey had appointed to command his 600-ship fleet, set up a massive blockade to prevent Caesar from crossing to Greece and to prevent any aid to Italy. Caesar, defying convention, chose to cross the Adriatic during the winter, with only half his fleet at a time. As Pontifex Maximus, Caesar was responsible for adjusting the Roman calendar at the end of each year to align it with the rotation of the Earth around the sun. As Caesar had been in Gaul and then occupied by the civil war for years, he had not been able to make this yearly change and over time, the difference between the Earth's rotation. Because of this, the calendar that Rome operated on had grown to such an extent that Bibulus, along with the others who had fled to Greece, believed that it was months later than when Caesar knew it was. As such, this move surprised Bibulus, who believed it was winter, and the first wave of ships managed to run the blockade easily. Now prepared, Bibulus managed to prevent any further ships from crossing, but died soon afterwards.\n\nCaesar was now in a precarious position, holding a beachhead at [[Epirus]] with only half his army, no ability to supply his troops by sea, and limited local support, as the Greek cities were mostly loyal to Pompey. Caesar's only choice was to fortify his position, forage what supplies he could, and wait on his remaining army to attempt another crossing. Pompey by now had a massive international army; however, his troops were mostly untested raw recruits, while Caesar's troops were hardened veterans. Realizing Caesar's difficulty in keeping his troops supplied, Pompey decided to simply mirror Caesar's forces and let hunger do the fighting for him. Caesar began to despair and used every channel he could think of to pursue peace with Pompey. When this was rebuffed he made an attempt to cross back to Italy to collect his missing troops, but was turned back by a storm. Finally, [[Mark Antony]] rallied the remaining forces in Italy, fought through the blockade and made the crossing, reinforcing Caesar's forces in both men and spirit. Now at full strength, Caesar felt confident to take the fight to Pompey.\n\nPompey was camped in a strong position just south of [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Dyrrhachium]] with the sea to his back and surrounded by hills, making a direct assault impossible. Caesar ordered a wall to be built around Pompey's position in order to cut off water and pasture land for his horses. Pompey built a parallel wall and in between a kind of no man's land was created, with fighting comparable to the trench warfare of [[World War&nbsp;I]]. Ultimately the standoff was broken when a traitor in Caesar's army informed Pompey of a weakness in Caesar's wall. Pompey immediately exploited this information and forced Caesar's army into a full retreat, but ordered his army not to pursue, fearing Caesar's reputation for setting elaborate traps. This caused Caesar to remark, \"Today the victory had been the enemy's, had there been any one among them to gain it.\"<ref>[[Plutarch]] ''Pompey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0058%3Achapter%3D65%3Asection%3D5 65.5], Dryden translation: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QScSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465 p. 465].</ref>  Pompey continued his strategy of mirroring Caesar's forces and avoiding any direct engagements.  After trapping Caesar in [[Thessaly]], the prominent senators in Pompey's camp began to argue loudly for a more decisive victory. Although Pompey was strongly against it \u2014 he wanted to surround and starve Caesar's army instead \u2014 he eventually gave in and accepted battle from Caesar on a field near Pharsalus.\n\n==Date and location==\nThe date of the actual decisive battle is given as 9 August 48 BC according to the republican calendar.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to the Julian calendar however, the date was either 29 June (according to Le Verrier's chronological reconstruction) or possibly 7 June (according to Drumann/Groebe).{{where?|date=July 2014}}{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As Pompey was assassinated on 3 September 48 BC, the battle must have taken place in the true month of August, when the harvest was becoming ripe (or Pompey's strategy of starving Caesar would not be plausible).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe location of the battlefield was for a long time the subject of controversy among scholars. Caesar himself, in his [[Commentarii de Bello Civili]], mentions few place-names;<ref>''Bellum Civile'' 3.81\u201398</ref> and although the battle is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers \u2013 the author of the ''Bellum Alexandrinum'' (48.1), [[Frontinus]] (''Strategemata'' 2.3.22), [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] (20), and [[Orosius]] (6.15.27) \u2013 place it specifically at ''Palae''pharsalos. [[Strabo]] in his ''Geographica'' (''\u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac'') mentions both old and new Pharsaloi, and notes that the Thetideion, the temple to [[Thetis]] south of Scotoussa, was near both. In 198 BC, in the [[Second Macedonian War]], [[Philip V of Macedon]] sacked Palaepharsalos ([[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 32.13.9), but left new Pharsalos untouched. These two details perhaps imply that the two cities were not close neighbours. Until the early 20th century, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, scholars followed [[Appian]] (2.75) and located the battle of 48 BC south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today's [[Pharsala]]).<ref>Map with conjectured locations, ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1921 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=21]</ref>\n\nThe \u201cnorth-bank\u201d thesis of [[F.

Some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar's wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswarsto1000/p/pharsalus.htm|title=Battle of Pharsalus |publisher=militaryhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> According to his accounts, he had 80 [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] on the battlefield, about 22,000 men.<ref>Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili,III 89,2</ref>\n\n===Pompeian army===\n\nIn total, Caesar counted 110 complete cohorts in the Pompeian army, 11 legions consisting of about 45,000 men, although [[Orosius]], following [[Livy]] and Pollio, only counted 88 cohorts,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and Hans Delbr\u00fcck suggests that Caesar's count includes detachments at Dyrrachium and elsewhere, leaving only 90 cohorts in the Pompeian army, counting naval support.<ref>Hans Delbr\u00fcck, ''Warfare in Antiquity'', p. 545.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Deployment===\n[[File:The Battle of Pharsalus - initial dispositions.png|thumb|Initial deployment of forces at the Battle of Pharsalus, August 48 BC]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nOn the Pharsalian plain, Pompey deployed his infantry in the traditional three lines of 10 men deep, thusly: Legions I and III were on the left with Pompey himself; at his center were the legions from Syria commanded by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Scipio]], and on the right, against the Enipeus River, were legions from Cilicia and Spanish auxiliaries. Pompey's cavalry, which greatly outnumbered Caesar's, were commanded by [[Titus Labienus|Labienus]], a brilliant cavalry commander and Caesar's old lieutenant during the [[Gallic Wars]]. They were massed in a single body on Pompey's left flank, together with his auxiliary archers and slingers. Pompey's tactical plan was to allow Caesar's legions to charge while his own stood their ground, reasoning that the enemy would fatigue by charging the double distance, and that his own men would better withstand the [[pilum]] toss while stationary. Simultaneously his cavalry would overwhelm the enemy's and then take the legions in the flank and rear \u2014 a classic [[hammer and anvil]] tactic.\n\nCaesar also deployed his men in three lines, but, being outnumbered, had to thin his ranks to a depth of only six men, in order to match the frontage presented by Pompey. His left flank, resting on the Enipeus River, consisted of his [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|battle worn]] IX<sup>th</sup> legion supplemented by the VIII<sup>th</sup> legion, these commanded by [[Mark Antony]]. The center was commanded by [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus|Domitius]] and upon his right he placed his favored X<sup>th</sup> legion, giving [[Publius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] command of this flank \u2014 Caesar himself took his stand on the right, across from Pompey. Upon seeing the disposition of Pompey's army Caesar grew discomforted, and further thinned his third line in order to form a fourth line on his right: this to counter the onslaught of the enemy cavalry, which he knew his numerically inferior cavalry could not withstand. This new line he gave detailed instructions for the role they would play, hinting that upon them would rest the fortunes of the day, and gave strict orders to his third line not to charge until specifically ordered.\n\n=== Progress of the battle ===\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\nThere was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.<ref>Caesar, BC III 92,1.</ref> Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser [[Caius Triarius]] believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against [[Pilum|pila]] throws.<ref>Caesar, BC III, 92,2.</ref> Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under [[Mark Antony]] and [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]] started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;<ref>Caesar, BC III, 93,1.</ref> Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided.\n\nAs Pompey's infantry fought, [[Labienus]] ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their [[Pilum|pila]] to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties. After failing to reform, the rest of the cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans. These broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/19860273/48_BC_The_Battle_of_Pharsalus</ref>\n\nAfter routing Pompey's cavalry, Caesar threw in his last line of reserves<ref>Caesar, BC III, 93,4</ref> \u2014a move which at this point meant that the battle was more or less decided.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Pompey lost the will to fight as he watched both cavalry and legions under his command break formation and flee from battle, and he retreated to his camp, leaving the rest of his troops at the centre and right flank to their own devices. He ordered the garrisoned auxiliaries to defend the camp as he gathered his family, loaded up gold, and threw off his general's cloak to make a quick escape.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As the rest of Pompey's army were left confused, Caesar urged his men to end the day by routing the rest of Pompey's troops and capturing the Pompeian camp.  They complied with his wishes; after finishing off the remains of Pompey's men, they furiously attacked the camp walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the Pompeian camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but were not able to fend off the assault.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/19860273/48_BC_The_Battle_of_Pharsalus</ref>\n\nCaesar had won his greatest victory, claiming to have only lost about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions.<ref>Caesar, BC III 99,1.</ref> In his history of the war, Caesar would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and remembered each of his [[centurion]]s by name. He also questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.<ref>Caesar, BC III, 92,3.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nPompey fled from Pharsalus to [[Egypt]], where he was assassinated on the order of [[Ptolemy XIII]]. Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but instead secured him as a furious enemy.  Ptolemy, advised by his regent, the eunuch [[Pothinus]], and his rhetoric tutor [[Theodotus of Chios]], had failed to take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to a great number of those of the [[Optimates|senatorial]] faction in their defeat. Even men who had been bitter enemies were allowed not only to return to Rome but to assume their previous positions in Roman society.\n\nPompey's assassination had deprived Caesar of his ultimate public relations moment \u2014 pardoning his most ardent rival. The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the [[First Triumvirate]]. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons, [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and [[Sextus Pompey]], and the Pompeian faction, led now by Metellus Scipio and Cato, survived and fought for their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the [[Optimates|senatorial faction]].  After seemingly vanquishing all his enemies and bringing peace to Rome, he was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC by friends, in a conspiracy organized by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].\n\n==Importance==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 da Bologna 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|14th century miniature by [[Niccol\u00f2 da Bologna]] showing Caesar, the victor over Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus]]\n[[Paul K. Davis (historian)|Paul K. Davis]] wrote that \"Caesar's victory took him to the pinnacle of power, effectively ending the Republic.\"<ref>Paul K. Davis, ''100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World\u2019s Major Battles and How They Shaped History'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1999), 59.</ref> The battle itself did not end the civil war but it was decisive and gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy. Until then much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and his allies due to the extensive list of clients he held in all corners of the Republic.  After Pompey's defeat former allies began to align themselves with Caesar as some came to believe the gods favored him, while for others it was simple self-preservation.  The ancients took great stock in success as a sign of favoritism by the gods.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  This is especially true of success in the face of almost certain defeat \u2014 as Caesar experienced at Pharsalus.  This allowed Caesar to parlay this single victory into a huge network of willing clients to better secure his hold over power and force the Optimates into near exile in search for allies to continue the fight against Caesar.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe battle gives its name to the following artistic, geographical, and business concerns:\n\n* ''[[Pharsalia]]'', a poem by [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]\n* [[Pharsalia, New York]], U.S.\n* [[Pharsalia Technologies]], Inc.\n\nIn [[Alexander Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', the author makes reference to Caesar's purported order that his men try to cut the faces of their opponents - their vanity supposedly being of more value to them than their lives.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dumas |first=Alexander |date=2009 |title=The Three Musketeers |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=620 |isbn=0199538468 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.livius.org/pha-phd/pharsalus/battle.html Caesar's account of the battle]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=1 Frank Laurence Lucas, 'The Battlefield of Pharsalos', ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1919\u201321]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4434412 Michel Rambaud, 'Le Soleil de Pharsale', ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte '', Vol.3, No.4, 1955]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/283876 William E.

The Sasquatch Genome Project is a collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of scientists from independent, public, and academic laboratories. DeNovo is a multi-disciplinary scientific journal providing three levels of peer review.\n\nThis is only the first official step in scientific recognition of the species. A follow on step would be to secure the recognition and inclusion of a DNA sample from Homo sapiens cognatus by [[GenBank]] a DNA repository whose catalogue, though incomplete, is well recognized by the scientific community.  GenBank provides standardized accepted procedures for the collection and analysis of DNA samples.\n\nAccording to a statement by an ICZN associate scientist, \"ZooBank and the ICZN do not review evidence for the legitimacy of organisms to which names are applied \u2013 that is outside our mandate, and is really the job of the relevant taxonomic/biological community (in this case, [[Primatology|primatologists]]) to do that.  When H. s. cognatus was first registered, needless to say we received a lot of inquiry about it. We scrutinized the original description and registration of this name as best as we could, and as far as we can determine, all the requirements for establishing the new name were fulfilled. Thus, at the moment, we have no grounds to reject the scientific name. This says NOTHING about the legitimacy of the taxon concept \u2013 it\u2019s just about whether the name was established according to the rules.\"  There is no single organization of primatologists embued to provide recognition of evidence for the legitimacy.  Opinions of individual [[Primatology|primatologists]] are disparate but generally antagonistic.\n\nThe evidence advanced supporting the existence of such a large, ape-like creature has often been attributed to hoaxes or delusion rather than to sightings of a genuine creature.<ref name=\"skepdic\" /> In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, \"There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.\"<ref name=\"Goodavage\"/> In addition, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.\n\nHowever, primatologist [[Jane Goodall]] told [[National Public Radio]], \"Well now you will be amazed when I tell you that I'm sure that they (referring to Bigfoots) exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6469070?storyId=6469070|title='Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science'|publisher=}}</ref> Dmitri Bayanov, Chairman of the Smolin Seminar on Questions of Hominology at the [[State Darwin Museum|Darwin Museum]], Moscow, Russia tells us, \"All researchers versed in this science do know that Bigfoot is a mammal, not myth, because of the females' conspicuous mammae. All know that Bigfoot is a primate because of the dermal ridges on its soles, a diagnostic characteristic of primates. All hominologists, respectful of logic and the current classification of primates, know that Bigfoot is a non-sapiens hominid because of its nonhuman way of life and bipedalism. ... I think that one of the great scientific results of the 20th century was the discovery of relict hominids (homins, for short), popularly known as Abominable Snowman, Yeti, Yeren, Almas, Almasty, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, etc. Actually, it was a re-discovery by hominologists of what had been known to western naturalists from antiquity to the middle of the 18th century, when wild bipedal primates were classified by Carl Linnaeus as [[Homo troglodytes]] (i.e., caveman) or Homo sylvestris (i.e., woodman, forestman). As for eastern scholars and rural population in many parts of the world, they have always been aware of wild hairy bipeds, known under diverse popular names.\"<ref>\nBigfoot Research Paperback \u2013 Illustrated, January 1, 2011 by Dmitri Bayanov(Author)</ref>\n\nYet many other mainstream scientists do not consider the subject of Bigfoot to be a fertile area for credible science<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjKkFG8qVjcC&pg=PA83&dq=scientific+study+bigfoot#v=onepage&q=scientific%20study%20bigfoot&f=false|title=Intelligent design: William A.

[[Al Rinker]], Miles Rinker, James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers,<ref name=bicrdha/> who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers.

Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called 'The Three Harmony Aces' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men \u2013 Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell \u2013 and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\">{{cite book|first=Malcolm|last=Macfarlane|title=Bing Crosby: Day by Day|year=2001 |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm |website=Bingmagazine.co.uk }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1925, Crosby and his partner Al Rinker, brother of singer [[Mildred Bailey]], decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles where they met Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue ''The Syncopation Idea'' starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of ''The Syncopation Idea'' Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After ''The Syncopation Idea closed'', they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization. Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names.<ref name=\"macfarlane2001\"/> Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was \"I've Got the Girl\" with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&nbsp;rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html |title=Paul Whiteman's Original Rhythm Boys |website=Redhotjazz.com |accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Rhythm Boys===\nSuccess with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. Crosby may have been retained, as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker were bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made the difference, and \"[[The Rhythm Boys]]\" were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]], and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macfarlane| first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby \u2013 Day by Day| url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm#Chapter_3|website=BING magazine|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928 he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of \"[[Ol' Man River]]\". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film ''[[The King of Jazz]]'' with Whiteman, but Crosby's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra, performing nightly in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Coconut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's hits, including \"At Your Command\", \"[[I Surrender Dear]]\", and \"[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]\". When [[Mack Sennett]] signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married [[Dixie Lee]] in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.\n\n===Success as a solo singer===\n[[File:Bing Crosby - Modern Screen, September 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in 1932]]\nOn September 2, 1931, Crosby made his [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby|solo radio debut]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |title=Bing Crosby, Singer |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}</ref> Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and [[CBS Radio]].

A \"Battle of the Baritones\" with singer [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan \"Bing Was King\". Crosby played the lead in a series of [[I Surrender Dear (1931 film)|musical comedy short films]] for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'' (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]], in late 1934.\n\nHis first commercial sponsor on radio was [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby#Bing Crosby \u2013 The Cremo Singer|Cremo Cigars]] and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]''. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] stated, \"By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/bing-crosby-bing-his-legendary-years-hows-the-sound.153459/ |title=Bing Crosby- Bing!

His first son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]] was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', where he remained for the next ten years. ''[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]'', with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.\n\nIn 1936, Crosby exercised an option from Paramount to make a film out-of-house. He signed a one-film agreement with Columbia. Crosby wanted his friend [[Louis Armstrong]], who influenced his singing style, to appear in ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', a screen adaptation of ''The Peacock Feather''. He asked [[Harry Cohn]], but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong's \"crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]].\" Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss it anymore with Cohn. Armstrong's musical scenes, and comic dialogue improved his career. Crosby gave Armstrong equal billing with white co-stars. Armstrong starred as himself in many more films and appreciated Crosby's lack of racism, often thanking him in later years.<ref name=\"Pennies\">{{cite web |title=Pennies from Heaven (1936) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7c111410/Pennies-from-Heaven.html|website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nCrosby's vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the \"[[belt (music)|belting]]\" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called \"singing in American\" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet \"[[crooner]]\".\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname \"Der Bingle\" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].\n\nThe June 18, 1945, issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine stated, \"America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history.

He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future.

When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film,  television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the \"Road\" pictures.\n\nIn the 1949 Disney animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment. In 1960, he starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a cameo appearance.<ref name=\"kl.\" /> Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned  another ''Road'' film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.\n\nHe won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''.

He was the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the ''[[Flip Wilson Show]]'', singing duets with the comedian.

But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]], and [[country music]], and top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and ballads.{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=cassette 1, side B}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenlewis.info/crosby/jackapp.htm |title=Jack Kapp \u2013 Bing Crosby Internet Museum |website=Stevenlewis.info|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCrosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or the art of making a song's lyric ring true. \"I used to tell Sinatra over and over,\" said Tommy Dorsey, \"there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby.

From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F.

Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:\n<blockquote>[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.</blockquote>\n\nCrosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.<ref>Hammar, Peter.

But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945\u20131946 season.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. ABC was formed from the sale of the [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 after a federal [[anti-trust]] suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) [[Acetate disc|lacquer discs]] that played ten minutes per side at 33\u2153 rpm.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Bing Crosby Perry Como Arthur Godfrey 1950.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Perry Como]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]] in 1950]]\n\nCrosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for golf. He did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the [[Jasper National Park]] Invitational Golf Tournament in September when the radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason. He wanted better quality recording, the ability to eliminate mistakes, and to control the timing of his performances. Because Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the best audio equipment and arrange the microphones his way; microphone placement had been debated in studios since the beginning of the electrical era. He would no longer have to wear the toupee that CBS and NBC required for his live audience shows\u2014he preferred a hat. He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed him to make more money by finding a loophole where the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nMurdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947\u2014the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered Ampex, which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.\n\nCrosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:\n<blockquote>By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.</blockquote>\n\nMullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:\n<blockquote>In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it\u2014thought it was very funny\u2014but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.</blockquote>\n\nCrosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines.<ref name=\"Sterling, C. H. 1990\"/> In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200 and Scotch 111 tape from [[3M]]. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:\n\n<blockquote>One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.</blockquote>\n\nCrosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist [[Les Paul]], which led to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. ''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the \"telefilms\" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.\n\nCrosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as \"blurred and indistinct\" images, using a modified [[Ampex]] 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) audio tape moving at 360&nbsp;inches (9.1&nbsp;m) per second.<ref>\"Tape Recording Used by Filmless 'Camera{{'\"}}, ''New York Times'', November 12, 1951, p. 21.

He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.\n\nCrosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].\n\nCrosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in [[Cockermouth]] and fishing on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]]. His trip was filmed for ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although all did not go well at first as the [[salmon]] were not running.

When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it \"the Crosby lavalier\". At the time the humor of the name escaped me&nbsp;...\n\n\"Satchel Ass\" or \"Bucket Butt\" or \"My Fat-assed Kid\". That's how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack&nbsp;... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers&nbsp;... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early&nbsp;...\n\nWhen I saw ''Going My Way'' I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.<ref name=\"NoSpank\">{{cite book| title=Going My Own Way| url=http://www.nospank.net/crosbyg.htm |author=Gary Crosby|date=March 1983 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=978-0-385-17055-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nYounger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father.

I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote ''Going My Own Way'' out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.<ref name=\"Grudens, 2002, p. 59\">Grudens, 2002, p. 59.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby confirmed that their father was physically abusive.

She also appeared in the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''. In 2006, Crosby's niece, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book ''Me and Uncle Bing''.\n\nThere have been disputes between Crosby's two families beginning in the late 1990s. When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the [[California Civil Code]], Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as [[community property]] under California law.<ref>''Crosby v.

His last concert was in the [[Brighton Centre]] on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame [[Gracie Fields]] in attendance.

'''Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal''', usually known as the '''Basel Convention''', is an international [[treaty]] that was designed to reduce the movements of [[hazardous waste]] between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from [[developed countries|developed]] to [[Less Developed Countries|less developed countries]] (LDCs). It does not, however, address the movement of radioactive waste. The Convention is also intended to minimize the amount and [[toxicity]] of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.\n\nThe Convention was opened for signature on 22 March 1989, and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of October 2018, 186 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention. [[Haiti]] and the [[United States]] have signed the Convention but not [[ratification|ratified]] it.<ref name=UN>{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-3&chapter=27&lang=en |title=Status as at 13 January 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2013 |work=United Nations Treaty Database |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909184223/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-3&chapter=27&lang=en |archivedate=9 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/PartiesSignatories/tabid/1290/Default.aspx|title= Parties to the Basel Convention|website= www.basel.int|accessdate= May 31, 2013|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130614191851/http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/PartiesSignatories/tabid/1290/Default.aspx|archivedate= 14 June 2013|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWith the tightening of environmental laws (for example, [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|RCRA]]) in developed nations in the 1970s, disposal costs for hazardous waste rose dramatically. At the same time, globalization of shipping made transboundary movement of waste more accessible, and many LDCs were desperate for foreign currency. Consequently, the trade in hazardous waste, particularly to LDCs, grew rapidly.\n\nOne of the incidents which led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|''Khian Sea'' waste disposal incident]], in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti before being forced away. It sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.\n\nAnother is the 1988 Koko case in which five ships transported 8,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small town of Koko in Nigeria in exchange for $100 monthly rent which was paid to a Nigerian for the use of his farmland.\n\nThese practices have been deemed \"[[toxic colonialism|Toxic Colonialism]]\" by many developing countries.\n\nAt its most recent meeting, 27 November to 1 December 2006, the Conference of the parties of the Basel Agreement focused on issues of [[electronic waste]] and the dismantling of ships.\n\nAccording to Maureen Walsh, only around 4% of hazardous wastes that come from [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries are actually shipped across international borders.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Maureen|title=The global trade in hazardous wastes: domestic and international attempts to cope with a growing crisis in waste management|journal=Catholic University Law Review|year=1992|volume=42|pages=103\u2013140}}</ref> These wastes include, among others, chemical waste, radioactive waste, [[municipal solid waste]], [[asbestos]], incinerator ash, and old tires. Of internationally shipped waste that comes from developed countries, more than half is shipped for recovery and the remainder for final disposal.\n\nIncreased trade in recyclable materials has led to an increase in a market for used products such as computers. This market is valued in billions of dollars. At issue is the distinction when used computers stop being a \"commodity\" and become a \"waste\".\n\nAs of October 2018, there are 187 parties to the treaty, which includes 184 [[UN member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], the [[European Union]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. The nine UN member states that are not party to the treaty are [[East Timor]], [[Fiji]], [[Grenada]], [[Haiti]], [[San Marino]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Sudan]], [[Tuvalu]], and [[United States]].<ref name=UN />\n\n==Definition of ''hazardous waste''==\n\nA waste falls under the scope of the Convention if it is within the category of wastes listed in Annex I of the Convention and it exhibits one of the hazardous characteristics contained in Annex III.<ref>art 1 al a</ref> \nIn other words, it must both be listed and possess a characteristic such as being explosive, flammable, toxic, or corrosive. The other way that a waste may fall under the scope of the Convention is if it is defined as or considered to be a hazardous waste under the laws of either the exporting country, the importing country, or any of the countries of transit.<ref>art 1 al b</ref>\n\nThe definition of the term disposal is made in Article 2 al 4 and just refers to annex IV, which gives a list of operations which are understood as disposal or recovery. The examples of disposal are broad and include also recovery, recycling.\n\nAlternatively, to fall under the scope of the Convention, it is sufficient for waste to be included in Annex II, which lists other wastes, such as household wastes and residue that comes from incinerating household waste.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/Waste-management-services-2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214163038/http://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/Waste-management-services-2013.pdf |archivedate=14 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}, p.16</ref>\n\nRadioactive waste that is covered under other international control systems and wastes from the normal operation of ships are not covered.\n\nAnnex IX attempts to define \"commodities\" which are not considered wastes and which would be excluded.\n\n==Obligations==\nIn addition to conditions on the import and export of the above wastes, there are stringent requirements for notice, consent and tracking for movement of wastes across national boundaries. It is of note that the Convention places a general prohibition on the exportation or importation of wastes between Parties and non-Parties. The exception to this rule is where the waste is subject to another treaty that does not take away from the Basel Convention. The United States is a notable non-Party to the Convention and has a number of such agreements for allowing the shipping of hazardous wastes to Basel Party countries.\n\nThe OECD Council also has its own control system that governs the trans-boundary movement of hazardous materials between OECD member countries. This allows, among other things, the OECD countries to continue trading in wastes with countries like the United States that have not ratified the Basel Convention.\n\nParties to the Convention must honor import bans of other Parties.\n\nArticle 4 of the Basel Convention calls for an overall reduction of waste generation. By encouraging countries to keep wastes within their boundaries and as close as possible to its source of generation, the internal pressures should provide incentives for waste reduction and pollution prevention. Parties are generally prohibited from exporting covered wastes to, or import covered waste from, non-parties to the convention.\n\nThe Convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but contains no enforcement provisions.\n\nAccording to Article 12, Parties are directed to adopt a protocol that establishes liability rules and procedures that are appropriate for damage that comes from the movement of hazardous waste across borders.\n\nCurrent consensus is that as space is not classed as a \"country\" under the specific definition, export of e-waste to non terrestrial locations would not be covered. This has been suggested (somewhat laughably) as a way to deal with the \"Fridge Mountain\" and related deposits of waste in the UK and elsewhere in the event of a way to cheaply access space such as an orbital tether being built.\n\n==Basel Ban Amendment==\nAfter the initial adoption of the Convention, some least developed countries and environmental organizations argued that it did not go far enough. Many nations and NGOs argued for a total ban on shipment of all hazardous waste to LDCs. In particular, the original Convention did not prohibit waste exports to any location except [[Antarctica]] but merely required a notification and consent system known as \"prior informed consent\" or PIC. Further, many waste traders sought to exploit the good name of recycling and begin to justify all exports as moving to recycling destinations. Many believed a full ban was needed including exports for recycling. These concerns led to several regional waste trade bans, including the [[Bamako Convention]].\n\nLobbying at 1995 Basel conference by LDCs, [[Greenpeace]] and several European countries such as Denmark, led to the adoption of an amendment to the convention in 1995 termed the [[Basel Ban Amendment]] to the Basel Convention. The amendment has been accepted by 86 countries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/BanAmendment/tabid/1344/Default.aspx|title=Ratification of the Basel Convention Ban Amendment|first=Basel|last=Convention|website=www.basel.int|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224012638/http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/BanAmendment/tabid/1344/Default.aspx|archivedate=24 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the European Union, but has not entered into force (as that requires ratification by 3/4 of the member states to the Convention). The Amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly [[OECD]]) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including [[recycling]]. An area of special concern for advocates of the Amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, [[shipbreaking]]. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including Australia and Canada. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: Amendments to the convention enter into force after ratification of \"three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them\" [Art. 17.5]; so far, the Parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three fourth of the Parties that were Party to the Basel Convention when the Ban was adopted, or three fourth of the current Parties of the Convention[see Report of COP 9 of the Basel Convention]. The status of the amendment ratifications can be found on the Basel Secretariat's web page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basel.int/ratif/ban-alpha.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215022750/http://www.basel.int/ratif/ban-alpha.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 December 2004|title=Ban Amendment|date=15 December 2004|publisher=}}</ref> The [[European Union]] fully implemented the Basel Ban in its [[Waste Shipment Regulation]] ([[EWSR]]), making it legally binding in all EU member states. Norway and Switzerland have similarly fully implemented the Basel Ban in their legislation.\n\nIn the light of the blockage concerning the entry into force of the Ban amendment, Switzerland and Indonesia have launched a \"Country-led Initiative\" (CLI) to discuss in an informal manner a way forward to ensure that the trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries and countries with economies in the transition, do not lead to an unsound management of hazardous wastes. This discussion aims at identifying and finding solutions to the reasons why hazardous wastes are still brought to countries that are not able to treat them in a safe manner. It is hoped that the CLI will contribute to the realization of the objectives of the Ban Amendment. The Basel Convention's website informs about the progress of this initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basel.int/|title=Basel Convention Home Page|first=Basel|last=Convention|website=www.basel.int|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107155641/http://www.basel.int/|archivedate=7 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asbestos and the law]]\n* [[Bamako Convention]]\n* [[Electronic waste by country]]\n* [[Rotterdam Convention]]\n* [[Stockholm Convention]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Toxic Exports'', Jennifer Clapp, Cornell University Press, 2001.\n* ''Challenging the Chip: Labor Rights and Environmental Justice in the Global Electronics Industry'', Ted Smith, David A.

In 1964, [[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] designed the original BASIC language at [[Dartmouth College]]. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s tended to learn.\n\nIn addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]] (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model became very popular on [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]] and [[Data General Nova]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [[Hewlett-Packard]] produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the [[HP2000]] series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC.\n\nThe emergence of early [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original [[Microsoft BASIC]] in 1975. Due to the tiny [[main memory]] available on these machines, often 4&nbsp;kB, a variety of [[Tiny BASIC]] dialects were also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and naturally became the ''de facto'' programming language for the [[home computer]] systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These machines almost always had a BASIC installed by default, often in the machine's [[firmware]] or sometimes on a [[read only memory|ROM]] cartridge.\n\nBASIC fell from use during the later 1980s as newer machines with far greater capabilities came to market and other programming languages (such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) became tenable. In 1991, [[Microsoft]] released [[Visual Basic]], combining a greatly updated version of BASIC with a [[Graphical user interface builder|visual forms builder]]. This reignited use of the language and \"VB\" remains a major programming language to this day, in the form of [[VB.net]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[John G. Kemeny]] was the math department chairman at Dartmouth College, and largely on his reputation as an innovator in math teaching, in 1959 they won an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] award for $500,000 to build a new department building.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,825616,00.html |title= High Math at Hanover |date=23 February 1959 |magazine=Time}}</ref> [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] had joined the department in 1956, and from the 1960s they agreed on the need for programming literacy among students outside the traditional STEM fields. Kemeny later noted that \u201cOur vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny and Kurtz had made two previous experiments with simplified languages, [[DARSIMCO]] (Dartmouth Simplified Code) and DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). These did not progress past a single freshman class. New experiments using Fortran and ALGOL followed, but Kurtz concluded these languages were too tricky for what they desired. As Kurtz noted, Fortran had numerous oddly-formed commands, notably an \"almost impossible-to-memorize convention for specifying a loop: 'DO 100, I = 1, 10, 2'. Is it '1, 10, 2' or '1, 2, 10', and is the comma after the line number required or not?\"{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nMoreover, the lack of any sort of immediate feedback was a key problem; the machines of the era used [[batch processing]] and took long times to complete a run of a program. Kurtz suggested that [[time sharing]] offered a solution; a single machine could divide up its processing time among many users, giving them the illusion of having a slow computer to themselves. Small programs would return results in a few seconds. This led to increasing interest in a system using time-sharing and a new language specifically for use by non-STEM students.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nKemeny wrote the first version of BASIC. The [[acronym]] ''BASIC'' comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BASIC.html|title=BASIC|website=[[Jargon File]]|access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref> The new language was heavily patterned on FORTRAN II; statements were one-to-a-line, numbers were used to indicate the target of loops and branches, and many of the commands were similar or identical. However, the syntax was changed wherever it could be improved. For instance, the difficult to remember <code>DO</code> loop was replaced by the much easier to remember <code>FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2</code>, and the line number used in the DO was instead indicated by the <code>NEXT I</code>.{{efn|Fortran's DO had a <code>continue</code> for this purpose, but still required the line number to be entered.}} Likewise, the cryptic <code>IF</code> statement of Fortran, whose syntax matched a particular instruction of the machine it was originally written on, became the simpler <code>IF I=5 THEN GOTO 100</code>. These changes made the language much less idiosyncratic while still having an overall structure and feel similar to the original FORTRAN.{{sfn|Time|2014}}\n\nThe project received a $300,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]], which was used to purchase a [[GE-225]] computer for processing, and a Datanet-30 realtime processor to handle the [[Teletype Model 33]] [[teleprinter]]s used for input and output. A team of a dozen undergraduates worked on the project for about a year, writing both the DTSS system and the BASIC compiler.{{sfn|Time|2014}} The main CPU was later replaced by a GE-235,{{sfn|Time|2014}} and still later by a GE-635\n\nThe first version BASIC language was released on 1 May 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cis-alumni.org/TKurtz.html|title=Thomas E.

(In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with the very expensive computers, usually available only to lease.) They also made it available to high schools in the [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] area and put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as ''[[Dartmouth BASIC]]''.\n\n==Spread on minicomputers==\n\n[[File:Pn-pravez-class-5.jpg|thumb|right|\"Train Basic every day!\"&nbsp;\u2014 reads a poster (bottom center) in a Russian school. (ca. 1985\u20131986)]]\nKnowledge of the relatively simple BASIC became widespread for a computer language, and it was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer [[minicomputer]]s such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series, where [[BASIC-PLUS]] was an extended dialect for use on the [[RSTS/E]] time-sharing operating system. The BASIC language was available for the [[Data General Nova]], and also central to the [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]] system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where the language was implemented as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. A version was a core part of the [[Pick operating system]] from 1973 onward, where a compiler renders it into [[bytecode]], able to be interpreted by a virtual machine.\n\nDuring this period a number of simple [[computer game]]s were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield's ''[[Star Trek (text game)|Star Trek]]''. A number of these were collected by DEC employee [[David H. Ahl]] and published in a newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form, ''101 BASIC Computer Games'', published in 1973.<ref name=\"basicgames\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/|title=101 Basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1973|publisher=Creative Computing Press|location=Morristown, N.J.|language=English|oclc=896774158}}</ref> During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early [[personal computer]]. When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine, ''[[Creative Computing]]''. The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=May 11, 1981|title=Computer Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|issn=0199-6649|volume=3|issue=9|page=44}}</ref>\n\n==Explosive growth: the home computer era==\n\n[[File:CommodoreBasic.JPG|thumb|[[Commodore BASIC]] v2.0 on the [[Commodore 64]]]]\n[[File:Msxbasic.png|thumb|[[MSX BASIC]] version 3.0]]\nThe introduction of the first [[microcomputer]]s in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s famous judgement in 1975, \"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration\",<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD498.PDF|chapter=How do we tell truths that might hurt|title=Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective|last=Edsger|first=Dijkstra|date=June 18, 1975|publication-date=1982|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|isbn=978-0387906522|oclc=693424350|pages=129\u2013131}}</ref> BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers.\n\nOne of the first BASICs to appear was [[Tiny BASIC]], a simple BASIC variant designed by [[Dennis Allison]] at the urging of [[Bob Albrecht]] of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. He had seen BASIC on [[minicomputer]]s and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines like the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair 8800]]. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the ''[[People's Computer Company]]'' newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte]]''. Versions were written by [[Li-Chen Wang]] and Tom Pittman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/iNotes.html#TinyBasic|title=you had to pay $5 up front to get it\u2026|last=Pittman|first=Tom|website=www.ittybittycomputers.com|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> In 1975 MITS released [[Altair BASIC]], developed by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] as the company Micro-Soft,<ref>{{Cite web|title=We have a BASIC|publisher=[[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]]|url=http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|access-date=April 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130051115/http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/story.php?ii=20&sid=4|archivedate=November 30, 2012}}</ref> which eventually grew into corporate giant [[Microsoft]]. The first Altair version was co-written by Gates, Allen, and [[Monte Davidoff]].\n\nAlmost universally, [[home computer]]s of the 1980s had a [[read-only memory|ROM]]-resident BASIC interpreter, which the machines [[Booting|booted]] directly into.{{efn|Probably the only exception was the [[Jupiter Ace]], which instead used [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].}} When the [[Apple II]], [[PET 2001]], and [[TRS-80]] were all released in 1977, all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in [[immediate mode]] was presented, not the [[command-line interface]] used on systems running [[CP/M]] or [[MS-DOS]]. [[Commodore Business Machines]] included a version of Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The [[Atari 8-bit family]] had its own [[Atari BASIC]] that was modified in order to fit on an 8&nbsp;kB ROM cartridge. [[Sinclair ZX-80]] introduced [[Sinclair BASIC]] in 1980 that was later extended in [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. The [[BBC]] published [[BBC BASIC]], developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]], incorporating many extra [[structured programming]] keywords and advanced floating-point operation features.\n\nAs the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to [[Type-in program|type in the code]] from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from ''Creative Computing'' as ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform.<ref name=\"basicgames\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/|title=More basic computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1979|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0894801372|oclc=839377789|location=Morristown|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/|title=Big computer games|last=Ahl|first=David H.|date=1984|publisher=Creative Computing Press|isbn=978-0916688400|oclc=872675092|location=Morris Plains, N.J.|language=English}}</ref> The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the [[home computer]] market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as [[Learn to Program BASIC]] would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused [[CP/M]] computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, [[Microsoft BASIC]] ([[MBASIC]]) was one of the leading applications.<ref name=\"oldcomputer\">{{Cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/osborne-1.html|title=Osborne 1|website=oldcomputers.net|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==IBM PC and compatibles==\n\n[[File:IBM Cassette BASIC.png|thumb|[[IBM Cassette BASIC]] 1.10]]\n\nWhen IBM was designing the [[IBM PC]] they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft \u2013 [[IBM Cassette BASIC]] \u2013 but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS]] including [[IBM Disk BASIC]] (BASIC D), [[IBM BASICA]] (BASIC A), [[GW-BASIC]] (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and [[QBasic]], all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-publisher [[Borland]] published [[Turbo Basic]] 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name [[PowerBASIC]]). Microsoft wrote the windowed [[AmigaBASIC]] that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. These languages introduced many extensions to the original home-computer BASIC, such as improved [[string manipulation]] and graphics support, access to the [[file system]] and additional [[data type]]s. More important were the facilities for [[structured programming]], including additional [[control structures]] and proper [[subroutine]]s supporting [[local variable]]s. However, by the latter half of the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others, rather than learning programming themselves, while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. [[C (programming language)|C]] and later [[C++]] became the languages of choice for professional [[Shrink wrap contract|\"shrink wrap\"]] application development.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGRpeBZQYPoC|title=The Class Of Java|last=Pravin|first=Jain|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131755440|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/gne/c_programming_language/|title=GNE: the C programming language|website=fysh.org|access-date=June 14, 2017|quote=During the 1980s, C compilers spread widely, and C became an extremely popular language.}}</ref>\n\n==Visual Basic==\n\nIn 1991 Microsoft introduced  [[Visual Basic]], an evolutionary development of QuickBasic. It included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines, and optional [[Type system#STATIC|static typing]], as well as [[object oriented language|object-oriented]] constructs from other languages such as \"With\" and \"For Each\". The language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, \"Gosub\"/Return statements, and optional line numbers which could be used to locate errors. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new [[macro language]] for [[Microsoft Excel]], a [[spreadsheet]] program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of [[small business]]es efficiently wherever ease of development was more of a concern than processing speed.{{Original research inline|date=August 2017}}\n\nBy that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed \"in the blink of an eye\" even using a \"slow\" language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced [[VBScript]] in 1996 and [[Visual Basic .NET]] in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language.\n[[File:TriBasicExample.png|thumb|Three modern Basic variants: [[Mono (software)|Mono]] Basic, [[OpenOffice.org Basic]] and [[Gambas]]]]\n\n==Post-1990 versions and dialects==\n\nMany other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the [[open source]] [[QB64]] and [[FreeBASIC]], inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled [[RapidQ]], [[Basic For Qt]] and [[Gambas]]. Modern commercial incarnations include [[PureBasic]], [[PowerBASIC]], [[Xojo]], [[Monkey X]] and [[True BASIC]] (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz). Several web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including [http://www.quitebasic.com/ Quite BASIC] and Microsoft's [[Microsoft Small Basic|Small Basic]] (educational software). Versions of BASIC have been showing up for use on [[smartphone]]s and tablets. Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contains such implementations of BASIC programming language as [[smart BASIC]], [[Basic!]], [[HotPaw Basic]], [[BASIC-II]], [[techBASIC]] and others. Android devices feature such implementations of BASIC as [[RFO BASIC]] and [[Mintoris Basic]]. Applications for some mobile computers with proprietary OS ([[CipherLab]]) can be built with programming environment based on BASIC. An application for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] called ''[[Petit Computer]]'' allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support. A [[Petit Computer#Sequel|3DS sequel]] was released in Japan November 2014, in North America October 2015, and in Europe August 2017.\n\n==Calculators==\n\nVariants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise [[programmable calculator]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]], HP, Casio, and others.\n\n==Windows command line==\n\n[[QBasic]], a version of Microsoft [[QuickBASIC]] without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the [[Windows NT]] and DOS-[[Windows 95]] streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like [[Windows 7]] which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was [[GW-BASIC|GW-Basic]]. QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For [[Windows 95]] and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.\n\n==Other==\n\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Family-Basic-Keyboard-wCart.jpg|thumb|right|BASIC came to some video game systems, such as the Nintendo [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]].]]\nThe various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including [[LotusScript]], which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic. The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like [[PerlScript]], a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others; meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells. SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as [[WordBASIC]]. Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language. [[Chipmunk Basic]], an old school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for [[GNU/Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].\n\n==Nostalgia==\n\nThe ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple \"Try It In BASIC\" exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Popular computer magazines of the day typically included [[type-in program]]s.\n\nFuturist and sci-fi writer [[David Brin]] mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006 ''Salon'' article<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/09/14/basic_2/singleton/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918213750/http://www.salon.com/2006/09/14/basic_2/singleton/|archive-date=September 18, 2013|dead-url=yes|title=Why Johnny Can't Code|last=Brin|first=David|date=September 14, 2006|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> as have others who first used computers during this era.

More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables \"LOSS\" and \"LOAN\", which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to \"LOAN\" would silently overwrite the value intended as \"LOSS\". Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; \"SCORE\" would be interpreted as \"SC\" OR \"E\", where OR was a keyword. [[String (computer science)|String]] variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by \"double quotation marks\". Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.\n\nSome dialects of BASIC supported [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices and matrix operations]], useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.\n\n===Examples===\n\n==== Unstructured BASIC ====\nThe original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT.{{efn|From version 3 onwards.}} Although dropped by most later microprocessor derivatives it is used in this example from the 1968 manual<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_4th_Edition_Jan68.pdf|title=Basic: a manual for BASIC, the elementary algebraic language designed for use with the Dartmouth Time Sharing System|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=January 1968|publisher=Dartmouth College Computation Center|location=Hanover, N.H.|language=English|edition=4th|page=53}}</ref> which averages the numbers that are input:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n5 LET S = 0\n10 MAT INPUT V \n20 LET N = NUM \n30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 \n40 FOR I = 1 TO N \n45 LET S = S + V(I) \n50 NEXT I \n60 PRINT S/N \n70 GO TO 5 \n99 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNew BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language's PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is [[The C Programming Language|Kernighan and Ritchie]]'s [[Hello world program]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 PRINT \"Hello, World!\"\n20 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn [[infinite loop]] could be used to fill the display with the message.\n\nMost first-generation BASIC versions such as [[MSX BASIC]] and [[GW-BASIC]] supported simple data types, loop cycles, and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"gwBasic\">\n10 INPUT \"What is your name: \"; U$\n20 PRINT \"Hello \"; U$\n30 INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \"; N\n40 S$ = \"\"\n50 FOR I = 1 TO N\n60 S$ = S$ + \"*\"\n70 NEXT I\n80 PRINT S$\n90 INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \"; A$\n100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90\n110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)\n120 IF A$ = \"Y\" OR A$ = \"y\" THEN GOTO 30\n130 PRINT \"Goodbye \"; U$\n140 END\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe resulting dialog might resemble:\n\n What is your name: Mike\n Hello Mike\n How many stars do you want: 7\n *******\n Do you want more stars? yes\n How many stars do you want: 3\n ***\n Do you want more stars? no\n Goodbye Mike\n\n==== Structured BASIC ====\nSecond-generation BASICs (for example, [[HP BASIC for OpenVMS|VAX Basic]], [[SuperBASIC]], [[True BASIC]], [[QuickBASIC]], [[BBC BASIC]], [[Pick operating system|Pick BASIC]], [[PowerBASIC]] and arguably [[COMAL]]) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, [[line number]]ing is omitted from the language and replaced with [[label (computer science)|labels]] (for [[GOTO]]) and [[subroutine|procedures]] to encourage easier and more flexible design.<ref name=\"GBvsQB\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|title=Differences Between GW-BASIC and QBasic|date=2003-05-12|accessdate=2008-06-28|author=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019181140/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/73084|archivedate=2013-10-19}}</ref> In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.\n\nThe following example is in QuickBASIC:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"QBasic\">\nDECLARE SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount!)\nREM QuickBASIC example\nINPUT \"What is your name: \", UserName$\nPRINT \"Hello \"; UserName$\nDO\n   INPUT \"How many stars do you want: \", NumStars\n   CALL PrintSomeStars(NumStars)\n   DO\n      INPUT \"Do you want more stars? \", Answer$\n   LOOP UNTIL Answer$ <> \"\"\n   Answer$ = LEFT$(Answer$, 1)\nLOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = \"Y\"\nPRINT \"Goodbye \"; UserName$\nEND\n\nSUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount)\n   REM This procedure uses a local variable called Stars$\n   Stars$ = STRING$(StarCount, \"*\")\n   PRINT Stars$\nEND SUB\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==== Object-oriented BASIC ====\nThird-generation BASIC dialects such as [[Visual Basic]], [[Xojo]], [[StarOffice Basic]] and [[BlitzMax]] introduced features to support object-oriented and [[event-driven programming]] paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as ''methods'' of standard objects rather than ''operators''. Also, the [[Operating System]] became more and more available to the BASIC language.\n\nThe following example is in [[Visual Basic .NET]]:\n\n<!-- needs a better (event-driven?) example -->\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"vbnet\">\nPublic Module StarsProgram\n   Private Function Ask(prompt As String) As String\n      Console.Write(prompt)\n      Return Console.ReadLine()\n   End Function\n\n   Public Sub Main()\n      Dim userName = Ask(\"What is your name: \")\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Hello {0}\", userName)\n\n      Dim answer As String\n\n      Do\n         Dim numStars = CInt(Ask(\"How many stars do you want: \"))\n         Dim stars As New String(\"*\"c, numStars)\n         Console.WriteLine(stars)\n\n         Do\n            answer = Ask(\"Do you want more stars? \")\n         Loop Until answer <> \"\"\n      Loop While answer.StartsWith(\"Y\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\n\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Goodbye {0}\", userName)\n   End Sub\nEnd Module\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Standards==\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Minimal BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.60-1978 \"For minimal BASIC\"\n** ISO/IEC 6373:1984 \"Data Processing&nbsp;\u2014 Programming Languages&nbsp;\u2014 Minimal BASIC\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-55 Minimal BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.60-1978)''\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard for Full BASIC:\n** ANSI X3.113-1987 \"Programming Languages Full BASIC\"\n** INCITS/ISO/IEC 10279-1991 (R2005) \"Information Technology \u2013 Programming Languages \u2013 Full BASIC\"\n* ANSI/ISO/IEC Addendum Defining Modules:\n** ANSI X3.113 Interpretations-1992 \"BASIC Technical Information Bulletin # 1 Interpretations of ANSI 03.113-1987\"\n** ISO/IEC 10279:1991/ Amd 1:1994 \"Modules and Single Character Input Enhancement\"\n* [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-116 BASIC ''(withdrawn, similar to ANSI X3.113-1987)''\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{Portal-inline|BASIC}}\n* [[List of BASIC dialects]]\n* [[List of Computers With On-Board BASIC]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===General references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/819683527|title=Programming languages: history and fundamentals|last=Sammet|first=Jean E.|date=1969|publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]]|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|language=English|oclc=819683527}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia\n  |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800025.1198404\n  |title=BASIC\n  |encyclopedia =History of Programming Languages I\n  |last=Kurtz|first=Thomas E.\n  |date=1981\n  |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n  |isbn=978-0127450407|doi=10.1145/800025.1198404<!-- (currently broken, reported to issuer) -->|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11\n  |editor-last=Wexelblat|editor-first=Richard\n  |location=New York\n  |pages=515\u2013537\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11399298|title=Back To BASIC: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language|last=Kemeny|first=John G.|last2=Kurtz|first2=Thomas E.|date=1985|publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]|isbn=9780201134339|oclc=11399298|pages=141}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12548310|title=The Basic Handbook: Encyclopedia of the BASIC Computer Language|last=Lien|first=David A.|date=1986|publisher=Compusoft Publishing|isbn=9780932760333|oclc=12548310|edition=3rd}}\n* {{cite magazine |magazine=Time |date=29 April 2014 |title= Fifty Years of BASIC, the Programming Language That Made Computers Personal |url=http://time.com/69316/basic/ |ref=CITEREFTime2014}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Programming:BASIC}}\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Programming/Languages/BASIC|BASIC}}\n* {{HOPL-lang|176|BASIC&nbsp;\u2014 Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code}}\n* {{YouTube|WYPNjSoDrqw|The Birth of Basic}}\n<!-- Please do not add any links for specific implementations of BASIC here.

Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (''symbasileis'') who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the [[List of Byzantine usurpers|various usurpers or rebels]] who claimed the imperial title.\n\nTraditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of [[Byzantium]] as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. It was under Constantine that the major characteristics of what is considered the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek East]], with Christianity as the [[state religion]].\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]] following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to [[Theodosius I]] in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The [[Western Roman Empire]] continued until 476.

The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the [[Pope|Papal]] coronation of the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (25 December 800 AD), done partly in response to the Byzantine coronation of [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]], whose claim, as a woman, was not recognized by [[Pope Leo III]].\n\nThe [[Style (manner of address)|title]] of all Emperors preceding [[Heraclius]] was officially \"''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''\", although other titles such as ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' were also used.  Their names were preceded by ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and followed by ''Augustus''. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'' (Gr. \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), which had formerly meant [[Monarch|sovereign]] but was then used in place of ''Augustus''. Following the establishment of the rival [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western Europe, the title \"''[[Autokrator]]''\" (Gr. \u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\". Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was \"[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" (cf. [[Names of the Greeks#Romans (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9)|\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9]] and [[R\u00fbm]]).\n\nIn the medieval period, [[dynasty|dynasties]] were common, but the principle of [[hereditary succession]] was never formalized in the Empire,<ref>p. 183, Karayannopoulous, Yanis, \"State Organization, Social Structure, Economy, and Commerce,\" ''History of Humanity \u2013 Scientific and Cultural Development from the Seventh to the Sixteenth Centuries, Vol. IV,'' M.

I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout.

According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly\u2019s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.<ref>[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: \"Predictability\", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015</ref> Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different\u2014but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.\n\nThe butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}</ref>\n\nSome scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357\u2013371 }}</ref> [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350\u2013362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}</ref> [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}</ref>\n\n== Illustration ==\n\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-\n! colspan=3|The butterfly effect in the [[Lorenz attractor]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| time 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;30 [[:Image:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|(larger)]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''z'' coordinate [[:Image:LorenzCoordinatesBig.png|(larger)]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Image:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|300px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Image:LorenzCoordinatesSmall.jpg|300px]]\n|-\n|colspan=3| These figures show two segments of the three-dimensional evolution of two trajectories (one in blue, and the other in yellow) for the same period of time in the [[Lorenz attractor]] starting at two initial points that differ by only 10<sup>\u22125</sup> in the x-coordinate.

They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.\n\nA [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.<ref name=\"Boeing2016Systems\" /> The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.\n\nIf ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map <math>f^t</math>, then <math>f^t</math> displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any \u03b4&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that <math>0 < d(x, y) < \\delta </math> and such that\n\n:<math>d(f^\\tau(x), f^\\tau(y)) > \\mathrm{e}^{a\\tau} \\, d(x,y)</math>\n\nfor some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].\n\nThe simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \\quad 0\\leq x_0\\leq 1,</math>\n\nwhich, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:\n\n:<math>x_{n}=\\sin^{2}(2^{n} \\theta \\pi)</math>\n\nwhere the [[initial condition]] parameter <math>\\theta</math> is given by <math>\\theta = \\tfrac{1}{\\pi}\\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})</math>. For rational <math>\\theta</math>, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] <math>x_n</math> maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] <math>\\theta</math> are irrational, and, for irrational <math>\\theta</math>, <math>x_n</math> never repeats itself \u2013 it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos \u2013 stretching and folding: the factor 2<sup>''n''</sup> shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps <math>x_n</math> folded within the range&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;1].\n\n==In physical systems==\n\n===In weather===\n\nThe butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: \"Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===In quantum mechanics===\n\nThe potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Its first product was [[Turbo Pascal]] in 1983, developed by [[Anders Hejlsberg]] (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of [[Borland Sidekick]], a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early and popular [[terminate and stay resident program]] (TSR) for [[DOS]] operating systems.\n\nBy the mid-1980s the company had become so successful that it had the largest exhibit at the 1985 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] other than IBM or AT&T.<ref name=\"pournelle198508\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-08/1985_08_BYTE_10-08_Declarative_Languages#page/n299/mode/2up | title=The West Coast Computer Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1985 | accessdate=27 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=293}}</ref> [[Bruce Webster]] reported that \"the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become 'the next Borland'\".<ref name=\"webster198608\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-08/1986_08_BYTE_11-08_Object-Oriented_Languages#page/n355/mode/2up | title=Going to the Faire | work=BYTE | date=August 1986 | accessdate=23 September 2016 | author=Webster, Bruce | pages=323\u2013328}}</ref> After Turbo Pascal and Sidekick the company successfully launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, [[Tim Berry (entrepreneur)|Tim Berry]], John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. [[Schroders]] was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with [[Goldman Sachs]] as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.\n\nIn 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its [[Borland Reflex|Reflex]] database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by [[Brad Silverberg]] and including Reflex co-founder [[Adam Bosworth]], became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at [[Microsoft]]. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the [[Quattro Pro|Quattro]] project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became [[Microsoft Access|Access]].\n\nIn 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into [[Turbo C]]. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen & Partners International(JPI), later [[TopSpeed]]. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the [[Clarion (programming language)|Clarion]] 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.\n\nIn September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their [[Borland Paradox|Paradox]] (version 2.0) [[database]] management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.\n\nThe [[Quattro Pro]] spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of [[Jim Manzi]] sued Borland for copyright infringement (see [[Look and feel]]). The litigation, ''[[Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.]]'',<ref name=LotusVBorland>{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18208011207990458376&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |title=Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 516 U.S. 233|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref> brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and \"fight for programmer's rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} After a decision in favor of Borland by the [[First Circuit Court of Appeals]], the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Because Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had recused himself, only eight Justices heard the case, and it ended in a 4\u20134 tie.<ref name=LotusVBorland/> As a result, the First Circuit decision remained standing, but the Supreme Court result, being a tie, did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Ryan |last2=Epstein |first2=Lee |title=Recusal and the \"Problem\" of an Equally Divided Supreme Court |journal=Journal of Appellate Practice and Process |date=Spring 2005 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201399, 81 |url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |accessdate=April 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215531/http://epstein.usc.edu/research/recusal.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] and [[intellectual property]] (IP), introducing its \"Borland no-nonsense license agreement\". This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products \"just like a book\"; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.{{Citation needed| date= September 2016}}\n\n===The 1990s: Rise and change===\nIn September 1991 Borland purchased [[Ashton-Tate]], bringing the [[dBase]] and [[InterBase]] databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. [[Microsoft]] launched the competing database [[Microsoft Access]] and bought the dBase clone [[FoxPro]] in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.\n\nThe internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the fall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready.<ref>[http://www.compuvision.info/delayed-graphical-products-put-dent-in-borlands-image.html Delayed Graphical Products Put Dent in Borland\u2019s Image], PC Week, April 20, 1992</ref> Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the [[ObjectVision]] team, redeployed) headed by [[Bill Turpin]] to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase, and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.\n\nDuring 1993 Borland explored ties with [[WordPerfect]] as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by [[Novell]]. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.\n\n[[Philippe Kahn]] and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Baby's arrival inspires birth of cellphone camera \u2014 and societal evolution |author= Kevin Maney |date= January 23, 2007 |work= USA Today |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2007-01-23-kahn-cellphone-camera_x.htm |accessdate= September 14, 2016 }}</ref> Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996.<ref name=\"KahnBoard\">{{cite press release|publisher=Borland |date= November 7, 1996 |url=http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |title=Kahn Resigns as Borland Director \u2013 Cites Increasing Demands of New Business |accessdate= September 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010618010852/http://www.borland.com/about/press/1996/pkresign.html |archivedate=June 18, 2001 }}</ref> Borland named [[Gary Wetsel]] as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996.

In November 1997, Borland acquired [[Visigenic]], a middleware company that was focused on implementations of [[CORBA]].\n\nOn April 29, 1998, Borland refocused its efforts on targeting enterprise applications development. Borland hired marketing firm [[Lexicon Branding]] to come up with a new name for the company. Yocam explained that the new name, Inprise, was meant to evoke \"integrating the enterprise\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Borland sheds past with new name, game |author=Jamie Beckett |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= April 30, 1998 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Borland-Sheds-Past-With-New-Name-Game-3007313.php |accessdate= September 14, 2016 }}</ref> The idea was to integrate Borland's tools, [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]], [[C++ Builder]], and [[JBuilder]] with enterprise environment software, including Visigenic's implementations of CORBA, [[Visibroker]] for C++ and Java, and the new product, [[Borland Enterprise Server|Application Server]].\n\nFor a number of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland suffered from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).\n\nIn 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller's title was \"interim president and CEO.\" The \"interim\" was dropped in December 2000. [[Keith Gottfried]] served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.\n\nA proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing [[Linux]]-based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.\n\n[[InterBase]] 6.0 was made available as [[open-source software]] in July 2000.\n\n===Later Borland years===\nIn January 2001, the Inprise name was abandoned and the company became \"Borland\" once more.\n\nUnder the Borland name and a new management team headed by president and CEO Dale L. Fuller, a now-smaller and profitable Borland refocused on Delphi, and created a version of Delphi and C++ Builder for Linux, both under the name [[Kylix programming tool|Kylix]]. This brought Borland's expertise in [[integrated development environment]]s to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.\n\nPlans to spin off the [[InterBase]] division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open-source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.\n\nDelphi 6 became the first integrated development environment to support web services.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} All of the company's development platforms now support web services.\n\n[[CSharpBuilder|C#Builder]] was released in 2003 as a native [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] development tool, competing with [[Visual Studio .NET]]. As of the 2005 release, C#Builder, Delphi for Win32, and Delphi for .NET have been combined into a single IDE called \"Borland Developer Studio\" (though the combined IDE is still popularly known as \"Delphi\"). In late 2002 Borland purchased design tool vendor TogetherSoft and tool publisher [[Starbase Corporation|Starbase]], makers of the [[StarTeam]] configuration management tool and the [[CaliberRM]] requirements management tool (eventually, CaliberRM was renamed as \"Caliber\"<ref>http://makingofsoftware.com/2014/list-of-rm-tools-updated-september-2014-version</ref>).

At the same time they announced the planned acquisition of Segue Software, a maker of software test and quality tools, in order to concentrate on application life-cycle management (ALM). On March 20, 2006, Borland announced its acquisition of Gauntlet Systems, a provider of technology that screens software under development for quality and security. On November 14, 2006, Borland announced its decision to separate the developer tools group into a wholly owned subsidiary. The newly formed operation, [[CodeGear]], was responsible for four IDE product lines.\n\nIn early 2007 Borland announced new branding for its focus around open application life-cycle management.

The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R.

He attended [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term \"invention\".\n\nYears later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.<ref name=pawley>{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=0-8008-1116-X}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]].

He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a [[crash rescue boat]] commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing\u2014although the company would ultimately fail<ref name=pawley /> in 1927.<ref name=\"Sieden-p84-85\">{{Cite book |first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden |title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work |location=New York |publisher=[[Perseus Books Group]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |pages=84\u201385 |quote=However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company.

The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges.

There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.\n\nOne of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.\n\nFuller's first \"continuous tension \u2013 discontinuous compression\" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R.

Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlett Dome Home|Fuller's home]] in Carbondale]]\nInternational recognition began with the success of huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at [[NC State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.\n\nFuller began working with architect [[Shoji Sadao]]<ref name=\"wrsc.org\"/> in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller & Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large [[geodesic dome]] for the [[Montreal Biosphere|U.S. Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].<ref name=\"wrsc.org\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wrsc.org/people/shoji-sadao |title=Shoji Sadao |work=World Resource Simulation Center |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref>  This building is now the \"[[Montreal Biosph\u00e8re]]\".\nIn 1962, the artist and searcher [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in Fuller's own words, devoted to \"applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity.\" Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|SIU Edwardsville]], where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |title=The Center for Spirituality & Sustainability |publisher=Siue.edu |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of \"omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity.\" Fuller referred to himself as \"the property of universe\" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work \"the property of all humanity\". For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.\n\nIn 1976, Fuller was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.\n\n===Honors===\nFuller was awarded 28 United States patents<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?as_drrb_ap=q&as_minm_ap=1&as_miny_ap=2007&as_maxm_ap=1&as_maxy_ap=2007&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=2007&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=2007&q=%22inventor%3A+richard+buckminster+fuller%22&btnG=Search+Patents |title=Partial list of Fuller U.S. patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> and many honorary doctorates.

I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing\u2014a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process\u2014an integral function of the universe.\"\n\nFuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.<ref>Edmondson, Amy, \"A Fuller Explanation\", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss</ref>\n\nHe had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 \"Dymaxion Award\" for \"poetically economic\" domed living structures.\n\n==Major design projects==\n[[File:G\u00e9ode V 3 1.gif|frame|A geodesic sphere]]\n\n===The geodesic dome===\nFuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] \u2013 [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions.

The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R.

Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.

One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened \"bell\" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.\n\nConceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325\u2013344|via=}}</ref> The design included a \"Go-Ahead-With-Life Room\" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel \"through time and space.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16\u201323}}</ref> It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft.

Johnson]] who, after leaving office, had them placed in the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971dec04-00080 |title=Cities on the Sea? |first=John |last=Lear |journal=The Saturday Review |volume=54 |date=December 4, 1971 |page=90 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of \u00bc-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.\n\nThe project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.\n\n===Dymaxion map and World Game===\nFuller, along with co-cartographer [[Shoji Sadao]], also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.\n\nIn the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,<ref>{{cite news |last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}</ref> in which players attempt to solve world problems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply \"Bucky\".\n\n==Language and neologisms==\nBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.<ref>\"What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often \"common sense\" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.\" Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103</ref> Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.<ref>He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled \"What I Am Trying to Do.\" And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.</ref>\n\nFuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that \"by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences.\"<ref>\"How Little I Know\" from And It Came to Pass \u2013 Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976</ref>\n\nThe words \"down\" and \"up\", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words \"in\" and \"out\" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. \"I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going \"outstairs\" and \"instairs.\"' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'\"<ref>''Intuition'' (1972).</ref>\n\n\"World-around\" is a term coined by Fuller to replace \"worldwide\". The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using \"wide\" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth\u2014a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms \"sunsight\" and \"sunclipse\", replacing \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].\n\nFuller also invented the word \"livingry,\" as opposed to weaponry (or \"killingry\"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. \"The architectural profession\u2014civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical\u2014has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.\"<ref>Critical Path'', page xxv.</ref>\n\nAs well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term \"[[tensegrity]]\" from ''tensional integrity''. \"Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.\"<ref>''Synergetics'', page 372.</ref>\n\n\"[[Dymaxion]]\" is a portmanteau of \"'''dy'''namic '''max'''imum tens'''ion'''\". It was invented about 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design \u2013 dynamic, maximum, and tension.<ref>''R. Buckminster Fuller \u2013 Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.</ref>\n\nFuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: \"The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.\"<ref name=\"cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller\">{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com</ref>\n\n==Concepts and buildings==\nHis concepts and buildings include:\n{|\n|\n* [[Dymaxion house]] (1928)\n* [[R.

Watterson stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his negative views on licensing and comic syndication, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art-form, and his move back into [[Private sphere|private life]] after he stopped drawing ''Calvin and Hobbes''. Watterson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] and grew up in [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]], whose suburban [[Midwestern United States]] setting was part of the inspiration for ''Calvin and Hobbes''.\n\n==Early life==\nWatterson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father James G. Watterson (1932\u20132016) worked as a [[patent attorney]]. The family relocated to [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]] in 1965 when Watterson was six because his mother Kathryn wanted to be closer to her family and felt that the small town was a good place to raise children.\n\nWatterson drew his first cartoon at age eight, and spent much time in childhood [[social isolation|alone]], drawing and cartooning.

He had already decided on a career in cartooning, but he felt his studies would help him move into editorial cartooning.

In ''The Complete Calvin and Hobbes'', Watterson stated that Calvin was named for \"a 16th-century theologian who believed in [[predestination]],\" and Hobbes for \"a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature.\"\n\nWatterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web| url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html| title=The Brief Tongue-in-Cheek Autobiography of Bill Watterson| author=Bill Watterson| accessdate=May 18, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705120756/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html| archivedate=July 5, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work===\nWatterson was inspired by the work of ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' [[political cartoonist]] [[Jim Borgman]], a 1976 graduate of Kenyon College, who currently draws ''[[Zits (comic strip)|Zits]]'', and decided to try to follow the same career path as Borgman, who in turn offered support and encouragement to the aspiring artist. Watterson graduated in 1980 and was hired on a trial basis at the ''[[Cincinnati Post]]'', a competing paper of the ''Enquirer''. Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him.  Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] area and attending college in central Ohio. The ''Post'' abruptly fired Watterson before his contract was up.<ref name = \"honk\">{{Citation | url = http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm | publisher = Tele | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060218193101/http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm | archivedate =February 18, 2006 | title= Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes on cartooning, syndicates, Garfield, Charles Schulz, and editors | newspaper = Honk Magazine | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | accessdate = March 17, 2006 | first = Andrew | last = Christie}}</ref>\n\nHe then joined a small advertising agency and worked there for four years as a designer, creating grocery advertisements while also working on his own projects, including development of his own cartoon strip and contributions to ''Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly''.<ref name= \"groc\">{{Cite book | title = The Complete Calvin and Hobbes | chapter = Introduction| page = 491 | volume = 1 | publisher=Andrew McMeel | author-link = Bill Watterson | isbn = 0-7407-4847-5 | year = 2005 | first =Bill | last = Watterson}}</ref>\n\nAs a freelance artist, Watterson has drawn other works for various merchandise, including album art for his brother's band, calendars, clothing graphics, educational books, magazine covers, posters, and post cards.<ref>{{cite web|title=The various other works drawn by Watterson.|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/watterson.html}}</ref>\n\n===''Calvin and Hobbes'' and rise to success===\nWatterson has said that he works for personal fulfillment.

He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space which they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no [[High culture|\"high\" art]] or [[Low culture|\"low\" art]]\u2014just art).<ref name=\"tenthanniversary\">{{Cite book| title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| author=Bill Watterson\n| year=1995| page=208| publisher=Andrews McMeel| isbn=0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>\n\n===Fight against merchandising his characters===\nFor years, Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something that he felt would cheapen his comic.<ref name=\"cheapcomic\">{{cite web| url=http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210115506/http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html | archivedate=February 10, 2006| title=The Cheapening of the Comics| author=Bill Watterson| work=Festival of Cartoon Art, Ohio State University| date=October 27, 1989| accessdate=March 17, 2006}}</ref> He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying ''Calvin and Hobbes'' images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and said that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue ''Calvin and Hobbes'' with a new artist. Watterson's position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Watterson| first = Bill|title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995|page = 10|isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>\n\nDespite Watterson's efforts, many unofficial knockoffs have been found, including items that depict Calvin and Hobbes consuming alcohol or Calvin urinating on a logo.

The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which take up half a page if published with its normal size. Some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features and reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut out the top two panels, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for ''Calvin and Hobbes'' that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as \"unnecessarily hot tempered\"). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, but he said that, in the end, it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers' readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at their own risk. He added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Watterson| first = Bill| title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book| publisher = Andrews and McMeel| year = 1995| page = 14| isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of ''Calvin and Hobbes''===\nWatterson announced the end of ''Calvin and Hobbes'' on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:\n\n{{bquote|\nDear Reader:<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be stopping ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat so many newspapers would carry ''Calvin and Hobbes'' is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade.

He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several ''Calvin and Hobbes'' anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years, Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Ohio]]. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.<ref name=\"2005 AP story\">{{cite web | url = http://www.projo.com/yourlife/content/projo_20051024_calhobbes.885b8c7.html | title = Calvin and Hobbes creator stays out of view, even at debut of collected strips | date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\nWatterson rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances.

It is an achromatic color, literally a color without [[hue]], like [[white]] and [[gray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/achromatic+color|title=Definition of ''achromatic''|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> It is often used [[symbol]]ically or [[figurative language|figuratively]] to represent darkness, while [[white]] represents light.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105\u201326}}\n\nBlack [[ink]] is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read. For the same reason, black text on a white screen  is the most common format used on computer screens.<ref name=\"Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126\">Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'' (2009), p. 126</ref>\nIn [[color printing]] it is [[CMYK color model|used along with]] the [[subtractive color|subtractive]] [[primary color|primaries]] [[cyan]], [[yellow]], and [[magenta]], in order to help produce the darkest shades.\n\nBlack and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance, good and evil, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] versus [[Age of Enlightenment]].   Since the [[Middle Ages]], black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105\u201326}}\n\nBlack was one of the first colors used by artists in [[neolithic]] cave paintings.  In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105\u201326}}\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with [[death]], evil, witches and magic.  According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', pp.&nbsp;105\u201327.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''bl\u00e6c'' (\"black, dark\", ''also'', \"ink\"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' (\"burned\"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' (\"to burn, gleam, shine, flash\"), from base *''bhel-'' (\"to shine\"), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' (\"ink\"), [[Old High German]] ''blach'' (\"black\"), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' (\"dark\"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' (\"to burn\"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bl\u00e4ck'' (\"ink\"). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' (\"to blaze, glow, burn\"), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' (\"to burn, scorch\").\n\nThe Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity.  ''Kuanos''' could mean both dark blue and black.<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau pg. 34\">Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 34.</ref>\n\nThe Ancient Romans had two words for black:  ''ater'' was a flat, dull black, while ''niger'' was a brilliant, saturated black.  ''Ater'' has vanished from the vocabulary, but ''niger'' was the source of the country name ''Nigeria''<ref>\"African nation, named for the river Niger, mentioned by that name 1520s (Leo Africanus), probably an alteration (by influence of Latin niger \"black\") of a local Tuareg name, egereou n-igereouen, from egereou \"big river, sea\" + n-igereouen, plural of that word. Translated in Arabic as nahr al-anhur \"river of rivers.\" (Online Etymological Dictionary)</ref>  the English word ''Negro'' and the word for \"black\" in most modern [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]]: ''noir''; [[Spanish language|Spanish and Portuguese]]: ''negro''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''nero'' ).\n\n[[Old High German]] also had two words for black: ''swartz'' for dull black and ''blach'' for a luminous black.  These are parallelled in [[Middle English]] by the terms ''swart'' for dull black and ''blaek'' for luminous black. ''Swart'' still survives as the word ''swarthy'', while ''blaek'' became the modern English ''black''.<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau pg. 34\"/>\n\nIn heraldry, the word used for the black color is [[sable (heraldry)|sable]],<ref>{{cite web|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A & C Black|Alphabooks/A&C Black]]|isbn=0-906670-44-6|pages=294, 343}}</ref> named for the black fur of the [[sable]], an animal.\n\n==History and art==\n\n===Prehistoric history===\nBlack was one of the first colors used in art.  The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of [[manganese oxide]].<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau pg. 34\"/>\n\n===Ancient history===\nFor the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of [[Anubis]], the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black [[jackal]], and offered protection against evil to the dead.\n\nFor the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river [[Acheron]], whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to [[Tartarus]], the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of [[Hades]], the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black [[ebony]] throne.\n\nBlack was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making [[black-figure pottery]] and later [[red figure pottery]], using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 270.</ref>\n\nIn the social hierarchy of [[ancient Rome]], purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn [[Latin]], the word for black, ''ater'' and to darken, ''atere'',  were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words \"atrocious\" and \"atrocity\".<ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', New York: World Publishing Company (1964).</ref>\n\nBlack was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a ''toga pulla'', to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the ''hora nigra'', the black hour.<ref name=\"Michel Pastoureau pg. 34\"/>\n\nThe German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, [[N\u00f3tt]], who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the [[raven]]. They believed that [[Odin]], the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;34\u201345.</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lascaux painting.jpg|[[Neolithic]] paintings of bulls in the [[Lascaux Cave]], more than 17,000 years old\nFile:Tutanhkamun jackal.jpg|[[Anubis Shrine|Statue of Anubis]], guardian of the underworld, from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]].\nFile:Akhilleus Aias MGEt 16757.jpg|Greek [[black-figure pottery]].

In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 272.</ref>\n\n====In the 12th and 13th centuries====\nIn fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by [[Benedictine]] monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the [[Cistercian]] monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, \"of death and sin,\" while white represented \"purity, innocence and all the virtues\".<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 80.</ref>\n\nBlack symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The [[black knight]] in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;86\u201390.</ref>\n\nBlack [[ink]], invented in Ancient China and India, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read.  It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of [[printing]].    A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created out of [[soot]], [[turpentine]] and [[walnut oil]]. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints.  Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.<ref name=\"Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna 040.jpg|The Italian painter [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] showed [[Christ]] expelling the [[Devil]], shown covered with bristly black hair (1308\u201311).\nFile:Fra Angelico 010.jpg|The 15th-century painting of the ''Last Judgement'' by [[Fra Angelico]] (1395\u20131455) depicted hell with a vivid black devil devouring sinners.\nFile:Jan Polack - Portrait of a Benedictine Monk - WGA18020.jpg|Portrait of a monk of the [[Benedictine Order]]  (1484)\nFile:Le Livre du c\u0153ur d'amour \u00e9pris1.jpg|The black knight in a miniature painting of a medieval romance,''Le Livre du c\u0153ur d'amour \u00e9pris'' (about 1460)\nFile:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|[[Gutenberg Bible]] (1451\u20131452). Black ink was used for printing books, because it provided the greatest contrast with the white paper and was the clearest and easiest color to read.\n</gallery>\n\n====In the 14th and 15th centuries====\nIn the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly scarlet cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the [[sable]]. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the [[marten]] family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe.  It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.\n\nIn the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of [[sumptuary laws]] in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from [[Venice]] and the peacock blue fabrics from [[Florence]] were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.<ref>Michel Pastoureau,  Noir \u2013 HIstoire d'une couleur, pp.&nbsp;93\u2013130.</ref>\n\nThe change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]], younger brother of King [[Charles VI of France]]. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King [[Richard II]] (1377\u20131399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419\u201320, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]]. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;121\u201325.</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Philip the good.jpg|[[Philip the Good]] in about 1450, by Rogier van der Weyden\nFile:Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Young Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|''Portrait of a Young Woman'' by [[Petrus Christus]] (about 1470)\nFile:Titian - Portrait of Charles V Seated - WGA22964.jpg|[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1500\u20131558), by [[Titian]]\nFile:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|Portrait of [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527\u20131598)\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern history===\n\n====In the 16th and 17th centuries====\nWhile black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. [[John Calvin]], [[Philip Melanchthon]] and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;146\u201347.</ref> In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet.

The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like [[Rubens]], went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new [[Baroque]] churches of the [[Counter-Reformation]] were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;150\u201351</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:John Calvin 11.jpg|Swiss theologian [[John Calvin]] denounced the bright colors worn by Roman Catholic priests, and colorful decoration of churches.\nFile:Increase Mather.jpg|[[Increase Mather]], an American Puritan clergyman (1688).\nFile:George-Henry-Boughton-Pilgrims-Going-To-Church.jpg|American Pilgrims in New England going to church (painting by George Henry Boughton, 1867)\nFile:Rembrandt van Rijn - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Rembrandt]], ''Self-portrait'' (1659)\n</gallery>\n\nIn the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of [[witchcraft]].  People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a [[Black Mass]] or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their [[familiar spirit]]s, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In medieval [[Flanders]], in a ceremony called ''Kattenstoet,'' black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of [[Ypres]] to ward off witchcraft.<ref>Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 279.</ref>\n\nWitch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious [[Salem witch trials]] in New England in 1692\u201393, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a \"black thing with a blue cap,\"  and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SALEM.HTM|title=The Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692|first=Prof.|last=Linder|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/calef/calef.html |title=More Wonders Of The Invisible World |publisher=Salem.lib.virginia.edu |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Matthewhopkins.png|An English manual on witch-hunting (1647), showing a witch with her [[familiar spirit]]s\nFile:Black cat eyes.jpg|[[Black cat]]s have been accused for centuries of being the [[familiar spirit]]s of witches or of bringing bad luck.\n</gallery>\n\n====In the 18th and 19th centuries====\nIn the 18th century, during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the [[French Revolution]], black again became the dominant color.\n\nBlack was the color of the [[industrial revolution]], largely fueled by [[coal]], and later by oil. Thanks to coal [[smoke]], the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned [[black carbon|black]].  By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was \"commonly called 'the [[Black Country]]'\u201d.<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Upton|title=And so it came to pass...|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/lifestyle/came-pass-3920518|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>  [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].\n\nA different kind of black was an important part of the [[romantic movement]] in literature. Black was the color of [[Melancholia|melancholy]], the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.\n\nThe invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.\n\nBlack dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. [[James McNeil Whistler]] made the color the subject of his most famous painting, ''Arrangement in grey and black number one''  (1871), better known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.\n\nSome 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: \"Reject black,\" [[Paul Gauguin]] said, \"and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray.\"<ref>Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri.  \u00c9crits d'un sauvage''. Textes choisis (1892\u20131903). Editions D. Guerin, Paris, 1974, p. 123.</ref> But [[\u00c9douard Manet]] used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter [[Berthe Morisot]] was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy;  he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect.<ref>Steffano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 302.</ref> [[Henri Matisse]] quoted the French impressionist [[Pissarro]] telling him, \"Manet is stronger than us all \u2013 he made light with black.\"<ref>Jack Flam, ''Matisse on Art'', p. 175.</ref>\n\n[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: \"What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black.\"<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n[[Vincent van Gogh]] used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.\n\nIn the late 19th century, black also became the color of [[anarchism]].

(See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)\n\nIn art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], a member of the [[Suprematist]] movement, created the ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, \"The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality&nbsp;... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea.\"<ref>Cited in Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 306.</ref>\n\nBlack was also appreciated by [[Henri Matisse]]. \"When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black,\" he said in 1945. \"Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction&nbsp;... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument.\"<ref>Jack Flam (1995), ''Matisse on Art'', p. 166.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as [[Juliette Greco]], and by some members of the [[Beat Movement]] in New York and San Francisco.<ref name=\"Eva Heller pg 120\">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la Couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 120.</ref> Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]] and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as ''[[The Wild One]]'', with [[Marlon Brando]]. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the [[punk subculture]] [[punk fashion]], and the [[goth subculture]]. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by [[Victorian era]] mourning dress.\n\nIn men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, [[John F. Kennedy]] was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.\n\nWomen's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer [[Coco Chanel]], who published a drawing of a simple black dress in ''Vogue'' magazine. She famously said, \"A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves.\"<ref name=\"Eva Heller pg 120\"/>  Other designers contributed to the trend of the [[little black dress]]. The Italian designer [[Gianni Versace]] said, \"Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance,\" and French designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] said, \"black is the liaison which connects art and fashion.<ref name=\"Eva Heller pg 120\"/> One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and was worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.\n\nThe American [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of [[African Americans]]. It developed into the [[Black Power]] movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan \"[[Black is Beautiful]]\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the [[Black Standard]] became the banner of several [[Islamic extremist]], [[jihadist]] groups. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Malevich.black-square.jpg|The ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' (1915) by [[Kazimir Malevich]] is considered the first purely abstract painting (Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow).\nFile:Lady Amaranth.jpg|The [[goth fashion]] model Lady Amaranth.

[[Pigment]]s or [[dye]]s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye \"look black\". A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called \"black\".\n\nThis provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[primary colors]].\n\nIn [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.\n\nIn elementary science, far [[ultraviolet]] light is called \"[[black light]]\" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].\n\nOn January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]'s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the then darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflected only 0.045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm|title=Nanotubes yield the blackest black|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> As of February 2016, the current darkest material known is claimed to be [[Vantablack]].<ref name=\"Guardian 29 February 2016\">{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Jonathan |title= Can an artist ever really own a colour? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2016/feb/29/anish-kapoor-vantablack-paint| date= 29 February 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT 5 November 2014\">{{cite news |last= Lee |first= Linda |title= Gazing Into the Void: What You Can Do With Vantablack, the Darkest Material Ever Made |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/garden/what-you-can-do-with-vantablack-the-darkest-material-ever-made.html?_r=0| date= 5 November 2014|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location=New York City| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nA material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see [[Solar thermal collector]]).\n\nAbsorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Vantablack_01.JPG|[[Vantablack]] is made of [[carbon nanotube]]s<ref name=\"SCMP\">{{cite web| url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1554903/vantablack-worlds-darkest-material-unveiled-uk-firm |title=Vantablack, the world\u2019s darkest material, is unveiled by UK firm| date=15 July 2014| website=South China Morning Post \u2013 World| accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> and is the blackest substance known, [[Optical properties of carbon nanotubes|absorbing a maximum of 99.965% of radiation in the visible spectrum]].<ref name=\"NBCNews\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/vantablack-u-k-firm-shows-worlds-darkest-material-n155581 |title=Vantablack: U.K. Firm Shows Off 'World's Darkest Material'| date=15 July 2014| website=NBCNews.com| accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n===Chemistry===\n\n====Pigments====\nThe earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were [[charcoal]], [[red ocher]] and [[yellow ocher]]. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with [[resin]].<ref name=\"Anne Varichon pg. 256\">Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs \u2013 pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nDifferent charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.\n* '''Vine black''' was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian [[Vitruvius]], the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of [[indigo]].\n\nThe 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: \"...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use.\"<ref name=\"Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60\">Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 60.</ref>\n\nCennini also noted that \"There is [[peach black|another black]] which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black.\"<ref name=\"Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60\"/> Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the [[peach]], [[cherry]] or [[apricot]]. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with [[gum arabic]] or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.\n\nDifferent civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The [[Inuit]] of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of [[Pinniped|seals]] to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned [[coconut]]s to produce their pigment.\n* [[Lamp black]] was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos.  The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance:  \"... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the bottom of the pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick. Wait a bit. take the pan and brush this pigment (that is, this smoke) onto paper or into a pot with something. And it is not necessary to mull or grind it because it is a very fine pigment. Re-fill the lamp with the oil and put it under the pan like this several times and, in this way, make as much of it as is necessary.\"<ref name=\"Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60\"/> This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the [[Ajanta Caves]], and as dye in ancient Japan.<ref name=\"Anne Varichon pg. 256\"/>\n* [[Ivory black]], also known as [[bone char]], was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.\n* [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars black]] is a black pigment made of synthetic [[iron oxides]]. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from [[Mars]], the god of war and patron of iron.\n\n====Dyes====\n\nGood-quality black [[dyes]] were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees;  usually the [[walnut]], [[chestnut]], or certain [[oak]] trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.\n\nA much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the [[Oak apple]] or '''gall-nut'''.  The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2\u20135&nbsp;cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the [[larva]] of certain kinds of [[gall wasp]] in the family Cynipidae.<ref name=cranshaw>{{cite book|last=Cranshaw|first=Whitney|title=Garden Insects of North America|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-09560-4}}</ref> The dye was very expensive;  a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye.  The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from [[Poland]], eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa.  Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.<ref>Michel Pastoureau (2008), ''Noir \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;112\u201313.</ref>\n\nAnother important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the [[logwood tree]], or [[Haematoxylum campechianum]], which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]], that is native to southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]].<ref name=GRIN>{{GRIN | ''Haematoxylum campechianum'' | 18172 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}</ref> The modern nation of [[Belize]] grew from 17th century [[Kingdom of England|English]] logwood logging camps.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is [[Nigrosin]], a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of [[nitrobenzene]], [[aniline]] and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a [[copper]] or [[iron]] [[catalyst]]. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.<ref>Green F. J.

They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as [[graphite]] ground with water and applied with an [[ink brush]]. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern [[inkstick]] have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the [[Warring States period]]. They were produced from [[soot]], usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with [[animal glue]]. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of [[Chinese brush painting]].<ref>{{citation|title=\u4e8c\u3001\u58a8\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u53f2|first=\u73ab\u82ac|last=\u8521|publisher=National Chang-Hua Hall of Social Education|url=http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|trans-title=Second, the ink history of the development|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041126130717/http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|archivedate=November 26, 2004|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[India ink]] (or '''Indian ink''' in [[British English]]) is a black [[ink]] once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for [[drawing]], especially when inking [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s.

After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Although a black hole itself is black, infalling material forms an [[accretion disk]], which is one of brightest types of object in the universe.\n* [[Black-body radiation]] refers to the radiation coming from a body at a given temperature where all incoming energy (light) is converted to heat.\n* Black sky refers to the appearance of space as one emerges from Earth's atmosphere.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:NGC 406 Hubble WikiSky.jpg|Image of the NGC 406 galaxy from the Hubble Space Telescope\nFile:Spirit Rover-Mars Night Sky.jpg|The night sky seen from Mars, with the two moons of Mars visible, taken by the NASA Spirit Rover.\nFile:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|Outside Earth's atmosphere, the sky is black day and night.\nFile:Olber's Paradox - All Points.gif|An illustration of [[Olbers' paradox]] (see below)\nFile:BH LMC.png|Simulated view of a black hole in front of the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n</gallery>\n\n====Why the night sky and space are black \u2013 Olbers' paradox====\nThe fact that [[outer space]] is black is sometimes called [[Olbers' paradox]]. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]], who posed the question of why the night sky was black.\n\nThe current accepted answer is that, although the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the [[Doppler effect]], and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question52.html|title=Why is space black?|website=starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].\n\nThe nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This phenomenon also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere.\n\n===Biology===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:01 Schwarzb\u00e4r.jpg|American black bear (Ursus americanus) near Riding Mountain Park, Manitoba, Canada\nFile:Dendroaspis polylepis by Bill Love.jpg|The [[black mamba]] of Africa is one of the most venomous snakes, as well as the fastest-moving snake in the world.

The [[Anarchist symbolism|symbols of anarchism]] was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.<ref name=\"blackflame\">Michael Schmidt and [[Lucien van der Walt]], ''[[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)|Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism]]''.

It was officially known as the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and it was under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]].\n\n'''Fascism'''. The [[Blackshirts]] ({{lang-it|camicie nere, 'CCNN}}) were [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups in [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars|Italy]] during the period immediately following [[World War I]] and until the end of [[World War II]]. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN).\n\nInspired by the black uniforms of the [[Arditi]], Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the military tool of his political movement.<ref name=\"Bosworth\">Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915\u20131945'', Penguin Books, 2005, p. 117.</ref> They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with [[fasces]], an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his [[March on Rome]] with the blackshirts.\n\nBlack was also adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were \"revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.\" Hitler also wrote that \"the new flag&nbsp;... should prove effective as a large poster\" because \"in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.\" The black [[swastika]] was meant to symbolize the [[Aryan]] race, which, according to the Nazis, \"was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm |title=Nazi propaganda pamphlet \"The Life of the F\u00fchrer\" |publisher=Calvin.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Mein Kampf]], volume 2, chapter VII |last=Hitler |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Hitler |year=1926}}</ref> Black became the color of the uniform of the [[SS]], the ''Schutzstaffel'' or \"defense corps\", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.\n\nThe Nazis used a [[black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the [[Nazi concentration camp badges]] on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to \"their kind.\" Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the [[Romani people]], the habitually \"work-shy,\" prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists.<ref>[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, \"asocials\", alcoholics and prostitutes].

The [[L\u00fctzow Free Corps]], composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing.  In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the [[German confederation]]. In 1866, [[Prussia]] unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.<ref>Eva Heller (2000) ''Psychologie de la Couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', pp.&nbsp;124\u201325.</ref>\n\n'''Islamism'''.

The expression is similar to [[black humor]] or [[black humour]].\n* A black mark against a person relates to something bad they have done.\n* A black mood is a bad one (cf [[Winston Churchill]]'s clinical depression, which he called \"my black dog\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/016/Dancing%20with%20the%20Black%20Dog%20By%20Hal%20Haralson_016_7_.htm|title=Dancing with the Black Dog|first=Hal|last=Haralson|work=christianethicstoday.com|accessdate=November 10, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107205020/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/016/Dancing%20with%20the%20Black%20Dog%20By%20Hal%20Haralson_016_7_.htm|archivedate=November 7, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Black market]] is used to denote the trade of illegal goods, or alternatively the illegal trade of otherwise legal items at considerably higher prices, e.g. to evade [[rationing]].\n* [[Black propaganda]] is the use of known falsehoods, partial truths, or masquerades in propaganda to confuse an opponent.\n* [[Blackmail]] is the act of threatening someone to do something that would hurt them in some way, such as by revealing sensitive information about them, in order to force the threatened party to fulfill certain demands. Ordinarily, such a threat is illegal.\n* If the black eight-ball, in [[billiards]], is sunk before all others are out of play, the player loses.\n* The [[black sheep]] of the family is the ne'er-do-well.\n* To [[Blackball (blacklist)|blackball]] someone is to block their entry into a club or some such institution. In the traditional English [[gentlemen's club]], members vote on the admission of a candidate by secretly placing a white or black ball in a hat. If upon the completion of voting, there was even one black ball amongst the white, the candidate would be denied membership, and he would never know who had \"blackballed\" him.\n* [[Black tea]] in the Western culture is known as \"crimson tea\" in Chinese and [[Chinese culture|culturally]] influenced languages ([[:zh:\u7d05|\u7d05]] [[:zh:\u8336|\u8336]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] ''h\u00f3ngch\u00e1''; Japanese ''k\u014dcha''; Korean ''hongcha'').\n* \"The black\" is a [[wildfire suppression]] term referring to a burned area on a [[wildfire]] capable of acting as a safety zone.\n* Black coffee refers to coffee without sugar or cream.\n\n==Associations and symbolism==\n\n===Mourning===\nIn Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with [[mourning]] and bereavement.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 109. In the survey cited, 80 percent of respondents said black was the color of mourning.</ref> It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.\n\nIn Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial [[mourning dress|dress code]]:  \"non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded.  Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat.  Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months.\"<ref>Patricia Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family, p. 300.</ref>\n\nA \"black day\" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] marked ''[[fasti]]'' days with white stones and ''nefasti'' days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the [[Black September in Jordan]], when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and [[Black July]] in [[Sri Lanka]], the killing of members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population by the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] government.\n\nIn the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which marked the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Dowager Electress Palatine in mourning.jpg|The dowager Electress of [[Palatine]] in mourning (1717)\nFile:Pedro II of Brazil and his sisters.jpg|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] and his sisters wearing mourning clothes due to their [[Pedro I of Brazil|father's]] death (1834)\nFile:Queen Victoria by Heinrich von Angeli.jpg|[[Queen Victoria]] wore black in mourning for her husband Prince Albert (1899)\n</gallery>\n\n===Darkness and evil===\nIn western popular culture, black has long been associated with [[evil]] and [[darkness]]. It is the traditional color of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].\n\nIn the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgment]]. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.\n\nThe [[vampire]] of literature and films, such as [[Count Dracula]] of the [[Bram Stoker]] novel,  dressed in black, and could only move at night. The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' became the archetype of witches for generations of children.  Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|The biblical [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], including famine riding a black horse (painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], 1887)\nFile:The Goblins' Christmas, 28.JPG|Drawing of a witch from the illustrated book ''The Goblins' Christmas'' by Elizabeth Anderson (1908)\nFile:Bela lugosi dracula.jpg|[[Count Dracula]] as portrayed by [[Bela Lugosi]] in the 1931 film version\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:MargaretHamiltoninTheWizardOfOz.jpg|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]], portrayed by [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' -->\nFile:NOLAHalloween2007CtinaWitchClarinet.jpg|Clarinet-playing witch in a New Orleans Halloween parade\n</gallery>\n\n===Power, authority, and solemnity===\nBlack is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]] (1285\u20131314), and in England from the time of [[Edward I]] (1271\u20131307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir \u2013 histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;114\u201315.</ref>\n\nUntil the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently [[black and white (police vehicle)|Black and white]]. The [[riot control]] units of the [[Basque Autonomous Police]] in Spain are known as ''[[beltzak]]'' (\"blacks\") after their uniform.\n\nBlack today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.\n\nBlack evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls.  Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The [[mortarboard]] hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a [[biretta]] worn by Medieval professors and clerics\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Supreme Court US 2009.jpg|The [[United States Supreme Court]] (2009)\nFile:ICJ-CJI hearing 1.jpg|Judges at the [[International Court of Justice]] in the Hague\nFile:LAPD Police Car.jpg|A police car of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]\nFile:Jacob1207b.JPG|American academic dress for a bachelor's degree\n</gallery>\n\n===Functionality===\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The [[Ford Model T]], the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 226.</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Alt Telefon.jpg|Olivetti telephone from the 1940s\nFile:1920 Ford Model T Centerdoor Sedan 2.jpg|A 1920 [[Ford Model T]]\nFile:Collection of old phones and PDA-BlackBerry.jpg|The first model [[BlackBerry]] (2000)\n</gallery>\n\nBlack house paint is becoming more popular with [[Sherwin-Williams]] reporting that the color, Tricorn Black, was the 6th most popular exterior house paint color in Canada and the 12th most popular paint in the United States in 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Laura |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/1/17631794/modern-black-houses-exterior-colors |title=Black is the new black |work=[[Curbed]] |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-07 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethnography===\n{{further information|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom|Demographics of Canada|Demographics of Australia|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}\n* The term \"black\" is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe [[African Americans]]. The terms for African Americans have changed over the years, as shown by the categories in the [[United States Census]], taken every ten years.\n* In the first U.S. Census, taken in 1790, just four categories were used: Free White males, Free White females, other free persons, and slaves.\n* In the 1820 census the new category \"colored\" was added.\n* In the 1850 census, slaves were listed by owner, and a B indicated black, while an M indicated \"[[mulatto]].\"\n* In the 1890 census, the categories for race were white, black, mulatto, [[quadroon]] (a person one-quarter black); [[octoroon]] (a person one-eighth black), Chinese, Japanese, or American Indian.\n* In the 1930 census, anyone with any black blood was supposed to be listed as \"[[Negro]].\"\n* In the 1970 census, the category \"Negro or black\" was used for the first time.\n* In the 2000 and 2012 census, the category \"Black or African-American\" was used, defined as \"a person having their origin in any of the racial groups in Africa.\" In the 2012 Census 12.1 percent of Americans identified themselves as Black or African-American.<ref name=thru>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\nBlack is also commonly used as a racial description in the [[United Kingdom]], since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census.  The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British.  Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.0 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, 0.8 percent as Black African, and 0.2 percent as Black (others).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |title=The Classification of Ethnic Groups |publisher=National Statistics |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406195623/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], census respondents can identify themselves as Black.

In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and/or [[Torres Strait]] Islanders.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''preto'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 6.8 percent of the population identified themselves as \"preto\".<ref>IBGE. 2008 PNAD.

In [[Medieval literature]], the [[knight (stock character)|white knight]] usually represented virtue, the [[black knight]] something mysterious and sinister. In American [[westerns]], the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat.\n* In the original game of [[chess]] invented in [[Persia]] or [[India]], the colors of the two sides were varied; a 12th-century Iranian chess set in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], has red and green pieces. But when the game was imported into Europe, the colors, corresponding to European culture, usually became black and white.\n* Studies have shown that something printed in black letters on white has more authority with readers than any other color of printing.\n* In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as [[black-and-white]], meaning that the issue at hand is [[dichotomy|dichotomized]] (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|Heroes in American [[westerns]], like the [[Lone Ranger]], traditionally wore a white hat, while the villains wore black hats.\n</gallery>\n\n===Black chambers and black ops===\nBlack is commonly associated with [[secrecy]].\n* The [[Black Chamber]] was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen [[Elizabeth I]] had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a ''cabinet noir'' was established inside the French post office by [[Louis XIII]] to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the [[French Revolution]] but re-opened under [[Napoleon I]]. The [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Dutch Republic]] had similar black chambers.\n* The United States created a secret peacetime [[Black Chamber]], called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the [[State Department]] and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes, including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, [[Henry Stimson]], stated that \"Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.\" The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].<ref name=NSAtimeline>{{cite web|title=Pre-1952 Historical Timeline|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/pre_1952_timeline/index.shtml|work=National Security Agency|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>\n* A ''black project'' is a secret military project, such as [[Enigma machine|Enigma Decryption]] during World War II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police [[sting operation]].\n* [[Black ops]] are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.\n* A [[Black Budget]] is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.\n\n===Elegance \u2013 black and fashion===\nBlack is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 119.</ref>\n\nBlack first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above.) In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 [[Edward VII]], then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short [[smoking jacket]].  The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a [[tuxedo]] in the U.S. The term \"smoking\" is still used today in Russia and other countries.<ref>\nStefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 308.</ref>\nThe tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the [[Duke of Windsor]] began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFor women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the [[little black dress|simple black dress]] by [[Coco Chanel]] in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]], explaining why black was so popular, said:  \"Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer [[Christian Dior]] said, \"elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity,\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and black exemplified elegance.\n\nThe expression  \"X is the new black\" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a [[clich\u00e9]].\n\nMany performers of both popular and [[European classical music]], including French singers [[Edith Piaf]] and [[Juliette Greco]], and violinist [[Joshua Bell]] have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer [[Johnny Cash]] always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song \"[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]\" to explain why he dressed in that color: \"We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black.\"\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Duke of Windsor (1970).jpg|The

the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. It has received latter-day fame as the central site for British (and subsequently, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]) [[World War II cryptography|codebreakers during World War II]], although at the time of their operation this fact was a closely guarded secret. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]].\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment, and the Bletchley Park Trust formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations, as well as [[The National Museum of Computing]], established on the site which includes a rebuilt Colossus machine, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015\u2019S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].

In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).
