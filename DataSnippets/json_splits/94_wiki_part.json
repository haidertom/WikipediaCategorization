The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available.

The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size.

It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.\n* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] \u2013 a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where [[anovulation]] and [[androgen]] excess are commonly displayed as [[hirsutism]].

These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).<ref>[[Insulin analog]]</ref> The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), [[Humalog]] (insulin lispro),{{citation needed|reason=Humulin first introduced in 1982 per humulin.com, I don't have any peer-reviewed lit though|date=April 2015}} it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15&nbsp;minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are [[NovoRapid]] and [[Apidra]], with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was [[Lantus]] (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24&nbsp;hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue ([[Levemir]]) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A [[myristic acid]] molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body\u00b4s own insulin release.\n\nInsulin is usually taken as [[subcutaneous injection]]s by single-use [[syringe]]s with [[hypodermic needle|needles]], via an [[insulin pump]], or by repeated-use [[insulin pen]]s with disposable needles.

Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Macleod was initially skeptical, since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature, but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas. Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting's lab assistants that summer, but Banting required only one lab assistant. [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] and Clark Noble flipped a coin; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This proved unfortunate for Noble, as Banting keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best.<ref name=\"pmid12473641\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E.

He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.<ref name=\"rosenfeld2002\"/>\n\nOn January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name=\"pmid8409364\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253\u201374 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 }}</ref> However, the extract was so impure that Thompson suffered a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were canceled.

Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.\n\n=== Synthesis ===\n\nPurified animal-sourced insulin was initially the only type of insulin available to diabetics.

The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.\n\n=== Nobel Prizes ===\n\n[[File:C.

([[voltage]]) in the conductor, described by [[Faraday's law of induction]]. According to [[Lenz's law]], the induced voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.\n\nAn inductor is characterized by its [[inductance]], which is the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of inductance is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]] (H) named for 19th century American scientist [[Joseph Henry]]. In the measurement of magnetic circuits, it is equivalent to [[Weber (unit)|weber]]/[[ampere]]. Inductors have values that typically range from 1{{nbsp}}\u00b5H (10<sup>\u22126</sup>{{nbsp}}H) to 20{{nbsp}}H.  Many inductors have a [[magnetic core]] made of iron or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] inside the coil, which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus the inductance. Along with [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s, inductors are one of the three passive [[linear circuit|linear]] [[circuit element]]s that make up electronic circuits.  Inductors are widely used in [[alternating current]] (AC) electronic equipment, particularly in [[radio]] equipment.  They are used to block AC while allowing DC to pass; inductors designed for this purpose are called [[choke (electronics)|choke]]s.  They are also used in [[electronic filter]]s to separate signals of different [[frequency|frequencies]], and in combination with capacitors to make [[tuned circuit]]s, used to tune radio and TV receivers.\n\n==Description==\nAn electric current flowing through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] generates a magnetic field surrounding it.

An inductor is a [[electronic component|component]] consisting of a wire or other conductor shaped to increase the magnetic flux through the circuit, usually in the shape of a coil or [[helix]]. Winding the wire into a [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] increases the number of times the [[magnetic flux]] [[Field Lines|lines]] link the circuit, increasing the field and thus the inductance.  The more turns, the higher the inductance.  The inductance also depends on the shape of the coil, separation of the turns, and many other factors.  By adding a \"magnetic core\" made of a [[ferromagnetic]] material like iron inside the coil, the magnetizing field from the coil will induce [[magnetization]] in the material, increasing the magnetic flux.  The high [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of a ferromagnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand over what it would be without it.\n\n===Constitutive equation===\nAny change in the current through an inductor creates a changing flux, inducing a voltage across the inductor.  By [[Faraday's law of induction]], the voltage induced by any change in magnetic flux through the circuit is given by<ref name=\"Purcell\" /> \n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_\\mathbf{B}}{dt}</math>.\n\nReformulating the definition of <math>L</math> above, we obtain<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n:<math> \\Phi_\\mathbf{B} = LI</math>.\nIt follows, that\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_\\mathbf{B}}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt}(LI) = -L\\frac{dI}{dt}</math>.\n\nfor <math>L</math> independent of time. \n\nSo inductance is also a measure of the amount of [[electromotive force]] (voltage) generated for a given rate of change of current. For example, an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry produces an EMF of 1 volt when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of 1 ampere per second. This is usually taken to be the [[constitutive relation]] (defining equation) of the inductor.\n\nThe [[duality (electrical circuits)|dual]] of the inductor is the capacitor, which [[Capacitor#Energy of electric field|stores energy in an electric field]] rather than a magnetic field. Its current\u2013voltage relation is obtained by exchanging current and voltage in the inductor equations and replacing ''L'' with the capacitance ''C''.\n\n===Lenz's law===\n{{Main|Lenz's Law}}\nThe polarity (direction) of the induced voltage is given by [[Lenz's law]], which states that the induced voltage will be such as to oppose the change in current.<ref name=\"Shamos\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0fCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT238&lpg=PT238&dq=1834+Lenz%E2%80%99s+Law&source=bl&ots=OydZ5Gh36h&sig=eMuxVY230eH6k_Kj4fZBWdA-jY8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigncny6dbVAhVi_4MKHVSUCzUQ6AEIZDAK#v=onepage&q=1834%20Lenz%E2%80%99s%20Law&f=false|title=Great Experiments in Physics: Firsthand Accounts from Galileo to Einstein|last=Shamos|first=Morris H.|date=2012-10-16|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486139623|language=en}}</ref> For example, if the current through an inductor is increasing, the induced voltage will be positive at the terminal through which the current enters and negative at the terminal through which it leaves, tending to oppose the additional current.<ref name=\"Schmitt\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Schmitt\n | first1 = Ron \n | title  = Electromagnetics Explained: A Handbook for Wireless/ RF, EMC, and High-Speed Electronics\n | publisher = Elsevier\n | date   = 2002\n | pages  = 75-77\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=7gJ4RocvEskC&pg=PA75&dq=%22lenz%27s+law%22+energy\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0080505236\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Jaffe\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Jaffe\n | first1 = Robert L.\n | last2  = Taylor\n | first2 = Washington\n | title  = The Physics of Energy\n | publisher = Cambridge Univ.

If the current is decreasing, the induced voltage will be negative at the terminal through which the current enters and positive at the terminal through which it leaves, tending to maintain the current.  In this case energy from the magnetic field is being returned to the circuit.\n\n===Energy stored in an inductor===\nOne intuitive explanation as to why a potential difference is induced on a change of current in an inductor goes as follows:\n\n:When there is a change in current, there is a change in the strength of the induced magnetic field. Without loss of generality, let us assume we have increased the current over our inductor, and now our induced magnetic field is stronger. This, however, does not come without a price. [[Magnetic_energy|Magnetic fields store energy]], and the stronger they are the more energy they store. To make up for an ''increase in magnetic potential energy'' in the induced magnetic field, we must ''take some energy'' from the inductor ''in the form of electrical energy''. Here we experience a drop in ''electric'' potential over the inductor i.e a negative voltage. Once we stop increasing the current, and keep it constant, no additional energy must be supplied to the magnetic field and the electrical potential returns to its original value, thus we see no voltage drop over the inductor.\n\n:Likewise, when the current decreases, the induced magnetic field strength decreases, and that superfluous energy must be returned. Hence, we experience an increase in ''electrical'' potential over the inductor.\n\n====Derivation====\nWe know that the [[Work_(physics)|work done]] per unit charge on a charged particle when passing the inductor is <math>-\\mathcal{E}</math>. The negative sign indicates that the work is done ''against'' the emf, and is not done ''by'' the emf.\n\nBy knowing that <math>I</math> is the charge per unit time, it follows that the rate of energy <math>W</math> done against the emf is given by\n:<math>\n\\frac{dW}{dt} = -\\mathcal{E}I = L\\frac{dI}{dt} \\cdot I = LI \\cdot \\frac{dI}{dt}.\n</math>\nWe may proceed to state that\n:<math>\ndW = L I\\cdot dI\n</math>.\n\nIf the magnetic field in the inductor approaches the level at which the core saturates, the inductance will begin to change with current and thus we will henceforth denote the inductance <math>L</math> with <math>L_I</math> to accommodate for this dependency. Neglecting losses, the [[energy]] <math>W</math> stored by an inductor with a current <math>I_0</math> passing through it, is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current through the inductor. This is given by:\n:<math>W = \\int_{0}^{I_0} L_I I dI</math>.\n\nIf the inductance is constant over the current range <math>L := L_I</math> , the stored energy is \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  W &= L\\int_0^{I_0} IdI \\\\\n  W &= \\frac{1}{2}L I_0^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor inductors with magnetic cores, the above equation is only valid for [[linear circuit|linear]] regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the [[magnetic saturation|saturation]] level of the inductor, where the inductance is approximately constant. Where this is not the case, the integral form must be used with <math>L_I</math> variable.\n\n===Ideal and real inductors===\n<!-- NB. Section header used in redirects to this page -->\n{{cleanup|section|reason=wordy; rambling|date=November 2017}}\nIn [[circuit theory]], inductors are idealized as obeying the mathematical relation (2) above precisely. An \"ideal inductor\" has inductance, but no [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[capacitance]], and does not dissipate energy. However real inductors have nonideal properties which cause their behavior to depart from this simple model.<ref name=\"Bowick\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Bowick\n | first1 = Christopher \n | title  = RF Circuit Design, 2nd Ed.\n | publisher = Newnes\n | date   = 2011\n | location = \n | pages  = 7-8\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=zpTnMsiUkmwC&pg=PA7&dq=inductor+%22parasitic+capacitance%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0080553427\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Kaiser\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Kaiser\n | first1 = Kenneth L. \n | title  = Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | date   = 2004\n | location = \n | pages  = 6.4-6.5\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=nZzOAsroBIEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inductor+%22parasitic+capacitance%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0849320879\n }}</ref> They have resistance (due to the resistance of the wire and energy losses in the core), and parasitic capacitance due to electric potential between the turns of wire. This [[capacitive reactance]] rises with frequency; at some frequency, the inductor will behave as a [[resonant circuit]], becoming [[self-resonant frequency|self-resonant]]. Above the self-resonant frequency the capacitive reactance is the dominant part of the impedance. At higher frequencies, resistive losses in the windings increase due to [[skin effect]] and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]].\n\nInductors with ferromagnetic cores have additional energy losses due to [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]]s in the core, which increase with frequency. At high currents, magnetic core inductors also show sudden departure from ideal behavior due to nonlinearity caused by [[magnetic saturation]] of the core. An inductor radiates electromagnetic energy into surrounding space and circuits, and may absorb electromagnetic emissions from other circuits, causing [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). For real-world inductor applications, these [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic]] parameters may be as important as the inductance.\n\nAn early solid-state electrical switching and amplifying device called a [[saturable reactor]] exploits saturation of the core as a means of stopping the inductive transfer of current via the core.\n\n====''Q'' factor====\nThe winding resistance appears as a resistance in series with the inductor; it is referred to as DCR (DC resistance).  This resistance dissipates some of the reactive energy. The [[Q factor|quality factor]] (or ''Q'') of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and is a measure of its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal inductor.  High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers.  The higher the Q is, the narrower the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the resonant circuit.\n\nThe Q factor of an inductor is defined as, where ''L'' is the inductance, ''R'' is the DCR, ''\u03c9'' is the radian operating frequency, and the product ''\u03c9L'' is the inductive reactance:\n\n:<math>Q = \\frac{\\omega L}{R}</math>\n\n''Q'' increases linearly with frequency if ''L'' and ''R'' are constant. Although they are constant at low frequencies, the parameters vary with frequency. For example, skin effect, [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], and core losses increase ''R'' with frequency; winding capacitance and variations in [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] with frequency affect ''L''.\n\nAt low frequencies and within limits, increasing the number of turns ''N'' improves ''Q'' because ''L'' varies as ''N''<sup>2</sup> while ''R'' varies linearly with ''N''.  Similarly, increasing the radius ''r'' of an inductor improves ''Q'' because ''L'' varies as ''r''<sup>2</sup> while ''R'' varies linearly with ''r''.  So high ''Q'' air core inductors often have large diameters and many turns.  Both of those examples assume the diameter of the wire stays the same, so both examples use proportionally more wire. If the total mass of wire is held constant, then there would be no advantage to increasing the number of turns or the radius of the turns because the wire would have to be proportionally thinner.\n\nUsing a high permeability [[ferromagnetic]] core can greatly increase the inductance for the same amount of copper, so the core can also increase the Q. Cores however also introduce losses that increase with frequency. The core material is chosen for best results for the frequency band.  High Q inductors must avoid saturation; one way is by using a (physically larger) air core inductor. At [[VHF]] or higher frequencies an air core is likely to be used. A well designed air core inductor may have a Q of several hundred.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:InductorSignalFilter1.png|150px|thumb|Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor blocks AC current, while allowing DC current to pass.]]\n[[File:InductorSignalFilter2.png|150px|thumb|Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor [[Decoupling (electronics)|decouples]] DC current, while allowing AC current to pass.]]\nInductors are used extensively in [[analog circuit]]s and signal processing.  Applications range from the use of large inductors in power supplies, which in conjunction with filter [[capacitor]]s remove [[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]] which is a multiple of the mains frequency (or the switching frequency for switched-mode power supplies) from the direct current output, to the small inductance of the [[ferrite bead]] or [[torus]] installed around a cable to prevent [[radio frequency interference]] from being transmitted down the wire.  Inductors are used as the energy storage device in many [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] to produce DC current.  The inductor supplies energy to the circuit to keep current flowing during the \"off\" switching periods and enables topographies where the output voltage is higher than the input voltage.\n\nA [[tuned circuit]], consisting of an inductor connected to a [[capacitor]], acts as a [[Electrical resonance|resonator]] for oscillating current.  Tuned circuits are widely used in [[radio frequency]] equipment such as radio transmitters and receivers, as narrow [[bandpass filter]]s to select a single frequency from a composite signal, and in [[electronic oscillator]]s to generate sinusoidal signals.\n\nTwo (or more) inductors in proximity that have coupled magnetic flux ([[mutual inductance]]) form a [[transformer]], which is a fundamental component of every electric [[Public utility|utility]] power grid. The efficiency of a transformer may decrease as the frequency increases due to eddy currents in the core material and skin effect on the windings. The size of the core can be decreased at higher frequencies. For this reason, aircraft use 400 hertz alternating current rather than the usual 50 or 60 hertz, allowing a great saving in weight from the use of smaller transformers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderquest.com/expounding-aircraft-electrical-systems.htm |title=Aircraft electrical systems |publisher=Wonderquest.com |accessdate=2010-09-24}}</ref>. Transformers enable switched-mode power supplies that isolate the output from the input.\n\nInductors are also employed in electrical transmission systems, where they are used to limit switching currents and [[fault current]]s. In this field, they are more commonly referred to as reactors.\n\nInductors have parasitic effects which cause them to depart from ideal behavior. They create and suffer from [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). Their physical size prevents them from being integrated on semiconductor chips. So the use of inductors is declining in modern electronic devices, particularly compact portable devices.  Real inductors are increasingly being replaced by active circuits such as the [[gyrator]] which can synthesize inductance using capacitors.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n==Inductor construction==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Common mode choke 2A with 20mH inductance.jpg\n| caption1 = A ferrite core inductor with two 20&nbsp;mH windings.\n| width1   = 130\n| image2   = Ferrite bead no shell.jpg\n| caption2 = A [[ferrite bead|ferrite \"bead\"]] [[choke (electronics)|choke]], consisting of an encircling [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] cylinder, suppresses electronic noise in a computer power cord.\n| width2   = 213\n| image3   = Drosselspule im Umspannwerk Bisamberg.jpg\n| caption3 = Large 50 [[volt-ampere reactive|Mvar]] [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]] iron-core loading inductor at an Austrian utility substation\n| width3   = 205\n| footer   =\n}}\n\nAn inductor usually consists of a coil of conducting material, typically insulated [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]], wrapped around a [[magnetic core|core]] either of plastic (to create an air-core inductor) or of a [[ferromagnetic]] (or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]]) material; the latter is called an \"iron core\" inductor. Since power inductors require high induction levels, high permeability and low saturation points in the core materials are not ideal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://info.triadmagnetics.com/blog/what-to-consider-when-constructing-power-inductors|title=What to Consider When Constructing Power Inductors|last=Dull|first=Bill|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}</ref> The high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are constructed like transformers, with cores of [[electrical steel]] [[laminate]]d to prevent [[eddy current]]s. 'Soft' [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are widely used for cores above [[audio frequency|audio frequencies]], since they do not cause the large energy losses at high frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes.  Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a ferrite bead on a wire.\n\nSmall inductors can be etched directly onto a [[printed circuit board]] by laying out the trace in a [[spiral]] pattern. Some such planar inductors use a [[magnetic core#Planar core|planar core]].  Small value inductors can also be built on [[integrated circuit]]s using the same processes that are used to make [[transistor]]s. Aluminium interconnect is typically used, laid out in a spiral coil pattern. However, the small dimensions limit the inductance, and it is far more common to use a circuit called a ''[[gyrator]]'' that uses a [[capacitor]] and active components to behave similarly to an inductor. Regardless of the design, because of the low inductances and low power dissipation on-die inductors allow, they're currently only commercially used for high frequency RF circuits.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Shielded inductors===\nInductors used in power regulation systems, lighting, and other systems that require low-noise operating conditions, are often partially or fully shielded.<ref name=\"Ott\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Ott\n | first1 = Henry W.\n | title  = Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons\n | date   = 2011\n | location = \n | pages  = 203\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=2-4WJKxzzigC&pg=PA203&dq=shielding+transformer+inductor\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1118210654\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Violette\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Violette\n | first1 = Norman \n | title  = Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook\n | publisher = Springer\n | date   = 2013\n | location = \n | pages  = 515-516\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=K7_nCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA516&dq=shielding+transformer+inductor\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 9401771448\n }}</ref> In [[telecommunication]] circuits employing induction coils and repeating transformers shielding of inductors in close proximity reduces circuit cross-talk.\n\n==Types==\n===Air-core inductor===\n[[Image:Antenna tuning coil - station WOR.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|An [[antenna tuner|antenna tuning]] coil at an AM radio station.

The term refers to coils wound on plastic, ceramic, or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as those that have only air inside the windings. Air core coils have lower inductance than ferromagnetic core coils, but are often used at high frequencies because they are free from energy losses called [[core loss]]es that occur in ferromagnetic cores, which increase with frequency. A side effect that can occur in air core coils in which the winding is not rigidly supported on a form is 'microphony': mechanical vibration of the windings can cause variations in the inductance.\n\n====Radio-frequency inductor====\n[[Image:Hf spoler og transformatorer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Collection of RF inductors, showing techniques to reduce losses.

In addition to causing power loss, in [[resonant circuit]]s this can reduce the [[Q factor]] of the circuit, broadening the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. In RF inductors, which are mostly air core types, specialized construction techniques are used to minimize these losses. The losses are due to these effects:\n; Skin effect: The resistance of a wire to [[high frequency]] current is higher than its resistance to [[direct current]] because of [[skin effect]]. Radio frequency alternating current does not penetrate far into the body of a conductor but travels along its surface.  For example, at 6&nbsp;MHz the skin depth of copper wire is about 0.001 inches (25&nbsp;\u00b5m); most of the current is within this depth of the surface.  Therefore, in a solid wire, the interior portion of the wire may carry little current, effectively increasing its resistance.\n; Proximity effect: Another similar effect that also increases the resistance of the wire at high frequencies is proximity effect, which occurs in parallel wires that lie close to each other. The individual magnetic field of adjacent turns induces [[eddy current]]s in the wire of the coil, which causes the current in the conductor to be concentrated in a thin strip on the side near the adjacent wire. Like skin effect, this reduces the effective cross-sectional area of the wire conducting current, increasing its resistance.\n; Dielectric losses: The high frequency electric field near the conductors in a [[LC circuit|tank]] coil can cause the motion of polar molecules in nearby insulating materials, dissipating energy as heat.  So coils used for tuned circuits are often not wound on coil forms but are suspended in air, supported by narrow plastic or ceramic strips.\n; Parasitic capacitance: The capacitance between individual wire turns of the coil, called [[parasitic capacitance]], does not cause energy losses but can change the behavior of the coil. Each turn of the coil is at a slightly different potential, so the [[electric field]] between neighboring turns stores charge on the wire, so the coil acts as if it has a capacitor in parallel with it. At a high enough frequency this capacitance can resonate with the inductance of the coil forming a [[tuned circuit]], causing the coil to become [[self-resonant frequency|self-resonant]].\n\n[[Image:Transmitter tank inductor.jpg|thumb|High Q tank coil in a shortwave transmitter]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Spider coil.jpg\n| width1   = 180\n| image2   = Kreuzwickelspule.png\n| width2   = 120\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Spiderweb coil ''(right)'' Adjustable ferrite slug-tuned RF coil with basketweave winding and litz wire\n}}\nTo reduce parasitic capacitance and proximity effect, [[Q factor|high Q]] RF coils are constructed to avoid having many turns lying close together, parallel to one another. The windings of RF coils are often limited to a single layer, and the turns are spaced apart. To reduce resistance due to skin effect, in high-power inductors such as those used in transmitters the windings are sometimes made of a metal strip or tubing which has a larger surface area, and the surface is silver-plated.\n; Basket-weave coils: To reduce proximity effect and parasitic capacitance, multilayer RF coils are wound in patterns in which successive turns are not parallel but criss-crossed at an angle; these are often called ''honeycomb'' or ''[[Basket winding|basket-weave]]'' coils.  These are occasionally wound on a vertical insulating supports with dowels or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through the slots.\n; Spiderweb coils: Another construction technique with similar advantages is flat spiral coils.These are often wound on a flat insulating support with radial spokes or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through the slots; these are called ''spiderweb'' coils. The form has an odd number of slots, so successive turns of the spiral lie on opposite sides of the form, increasing separation. \n; Litz wire: To reduce skin effect losses, some coils are wound with a special type of radio frequency wire called [[litz wire]]. Instead of a single solid conductor, litz wire consists of a number of smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary [[stranded wire]], the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its length on the outside of the wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.\n\n; Axial Inductor\nSmall inductors for low current and low power are made in molded cases resembling resistors.  These may be either plain (phenolic) core or ferrite core.  An ohmmeter readily distinguishes them from similar-sized resistors by showing the low resistance of the inductor.\n\n===Ferromagnetic-core inductor===\n{{See also|Magnetic core}}\n[[Image:Aplikimi i feriteve.png|thumb|A variety of types of ferrite core inductors and transformers]]\n\nFerromagnetic-core or iron-core inductors use a magnetic core made of a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as iron or [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] to increase the inductance. A magnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand, by increasing the magnetic field due to its higher [[magnetic permeability]]. However the magnetic properties of the core material cause several side effects which alter the behavior of the inductor and require special construction:\n  {{glossary}}\n  {{term|[[Core loss]]es}}{{defn|A time-varying current in a ferromagnetic inductor, which causes a time-varying magnetic field in its core, causes energy losses in the core material that are dissipated as heat, due to two processes:{{glossary}}\n  {{term|[[Eddy current]]s}}{{defn|From [[Faraday's law of induction]], the changing magnetic field can induce circulating loops of electric current in the conductive metal core.

Frequency of magnetic fluctuation is the frequency of AC current in the electric circuit; magnetic flux density corresponds to current in the electric circuit. Magnetic fluctuation gives rise to hysteresis, and magnetic flux density causes eddy currents in the core. These nonlinearities are distinguished from the threshold nonlinearity of saturation. Core loss can be approximately modeled with [[Steinmetz's equation]]. At low frequencies and over limited frequency spans (maybe a factor of 10), core loss may be treated as a linear function of frequency with minimal error. However, even in the audio range, nonlinear effects of magnetic core inductors are noticeable and of concern. }}\n{{term|Saturation}}{{defn|If the current through a magnetic core coil is high enough that the core [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturates]], the inductance will fall and current will rise dramatically. This is a nonlinear threshold phenomenon and results in distortion of the signal. For example, [[audio signal]]s can suffer [[intermodulation distortion]] in saturated inductors. To prevent this, in [[linear circuit]]s the current through iron core inductors must be limited below the saturation level. Some laminated cores have a narrow air gap in them for this purpose, and powdered iron cores have a distributed air gap. This allows higher levels of magnetic flux and thus higher currents through the inductor before it saturates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/vishay/Inductors101.pdf |title=Inductors 101 |publisher=vishay |access-date=2010-09-24}}</ref>}}\n{{term|Curie point demagnetization}}{{defn|If the temperature of a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic core rises to a specified level, the magnetic domains dissociate, and the material becomes paramagnetic, no longer able to support magnetic flux.  The inductance falls and current rises dramatically, similarly to what happens during saturation.  The effect is reversible: When the temperature falls below the Curie point, magnetic flux resulting from current in the electric circuit will realign the magnetic domains of the core and its magnetic flux will be restored.  The Curie point of ferromagnetic materials (iron alloys) is quite high; iron is highest at 770{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. However, for some ferrimagnetic materials (ceramic iron compounds \u2013 [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]s) the Curie point can be close to ambient temperatures (below 100{{nbsp}}\u00b0C).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} }}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n====Laminated-core inductor====\n[[Image:Vorschaltdrossel Kvg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Laminated iron core [[ballast (electrical)|ballast]] inductor for a [[metal halide lamp]] ]]\nLow-frequency inductors are often made with [[laminated core]]s to prevent eddy currents, using construction similar to [[transformer]]s. The core is made of stacks of thin steel sheets or [[lamination]]s oriented parallel to the field, with an insulating coating on the surface. The insulation prevents eddy currents between the sheets, so any remaining currents must be within the cross sectional area of the individual laminations, reducing the area of the loop and thus reducing the energy losses greatly. The laminations are made of low-conductivity [[silicon steel]] to further reduce eddy current losses.\n\n====Ferrite-core inductor====\n{{main|Ferrite core}}\nFor higher frequencies, inductors are made with cores of ferrite. Ferrite is a ceramic ferrimagnetic material that is nonconductive, so eddy currents cannot flow within it. The formulation of ferrite is xxFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> where xx represents various metals. For inductor cores [[soft ferrite]]s are used, which have low coercivity and thus low hysteresis losses.\n\n====Powdered-iron-core inductor====\n{{see also|Carbonyl iron}}\nAnother material is powdered iron cemented with a binder.\n\n====Toroidal-core inductor====\n{{main|Toroidal inductors and transformers}}\n[[File:3Com OfficeConnect ADSL Wireless 11g Firewall Router 2012-10-28-0869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Toroidal inductor in the power supply of a wireless router]]\n\nIn an inductor wound on a straight rod-shaped core, the [[magnetic field lines]] emerging from one end of the core must pass through the air to re-enter the core at the other end. This reduces the field, because much of the magnetic field path is in air rather than the higher permeability core material and is a source of [[electromagnetic interference]]. A higher magnetic field and inductance can be achieved by forming the core in a closed [[magnetic circuit]]. The magnetic field lines form closed loops within the core without leaving the core material. The shape often used is a [[toroid]]al or doughnut-shaped ferrite core. Because of their symmetry, toroidal cores allow a minimum of the magnetic flux to escape outside the core (called ''[[leakage flux]]''), so they radiate less electromagnetic interference than other shapes. Toroidal core coils are manufactured of various materials, primarily ferrite, powdered iron and laminated cores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/34053/definit.pdf |title=Inductor and Magnetic Product Terminology |publisher=Vishay Dale |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>\n\n===Variable inductor===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = Ferrite slug tuned inductor with pot core.JPG\n| width1   = 113\n| image2   = Variometer.jpg\n| width2   = 150\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Inductor with a threaded ferrite slug ''(visible at top)'' that can be turned to move it into or out of the coil. 4.2 cm high.

One of the contacts to the coil is made by the small grooved wheel, which rides on the wire.  Turning the shaft rotates the coil, moving the contact wheel up or down the coil, allowing more or fewer turns of the coil into the circuit, to change the inductance.]]\n\nProbably the most common type of variable inductor today is one with a moveable ferrite magnetic core, which can be slid or screwed in or out of the coil. Moving the core farther into the coil increases the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]],  increasing the magnetic field and the inductance. Many inductors used in radio applications (usually less than 100&nbsp;MHz) use adjustable cores in order to tune such inductors to their desired value, since manufacturing processes have certain tolerances (inaccuracy). Sometimes such cores for frequencies above 100&nbsp;MHz are made from highly conductive non-magnetic material such as aluminum.<ref>http://www.coilcraft.com/pdfs/uni5.pdf Coilcraft catalog page with aluminum cores. Accessed 10 July 2015.</ref>  They decrease the inductance because the magnetic field must bypass them.\n\nAir core inductors can use sliding contacts or multiple taps to increase or decrease the number of turns included in the circuit, to change the inductance. A type much used in the past but mostly obsolete today has a spring contact that can slide along the bare surface of the windings.  The disadvantage of this type is that the contact usually [[short circuit|short-circuits]] one or more turns.  These turns act like a single-turn short-circuited transformer [[secondary winding]]; the large currents induced in them cause power losses.\n\nA type of continuously variable air core inductor is the ''variometer''.  This consists of two coils with the same number of turns connected in series, one inside the other.  The inner coil is mounted on a shaft so its axis can be turned with respect to the outer coil.  When the two coils' axes are collinear, with the magnetic fields pointing in the same direction, the fields add and the inductance is maximum.  When the inner coil is turned so its axis is at an angle with the outer, the mutual inductance between them is smaller so the total inductance is less.  When the inner coil is turned 180\u00b0 so the coils are collinear with their magnetic fields opposing, the two fields cancel each other and the inductance is very small.  This type has the advantage that it is continuously variable over a wide range.  It is used in [[antenna tuner]]s and matching circuits to match low frequency transmitters to their antennas.\n\nAnother method to control the inductance without any moving parts requires an additional DC current bias winding which controls the permeability of an easily saturable core material.  See [[Magnetic amplifier]].\n\n===Choke===\n[[File:Two ferrite beads.jpg|thumbnail|An MF or HF radio choke for tenths of an ampere, and a ferrite bead VHF choke for several amperes.]]\nA [[choke (electronics)|choke]] is an inductor designed specifically for blocking high-frequency alternating current (AC) in an electrical circuit, while allowing DC or low-frequency signals to pass. It usually consists of a coil of insulated wire wound on a magnetic core, although some consist of a donut-shaped \"bead\" of ferrite material strung on a wire. Like other inductors, chokes resist changes in current passing through them increasingly with frequency. The difference between chokes and other inductors is that chokes do not require the high [[Q factor]] construction techniques that are used to reduce the resistance in inductors used in tuned circuits.\n\n==Circuit analysis==\nThe effect of an inductor in a circuit is to oppose changes in current through it by developing a voltage across it proportional to the rate of change of the current. An ideal inductor would offer no resistance to a constant [[direct current]]; however, only [[superconductor|superconducting]] inductors have truly zero [[electrical resistance]].\n\nThe relationship between the time-varying voltage ''v''(''t'') across an inductor with inductance ''L'' and the time-varying current ''i''(''t'') passing through it is described by the [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>v(t) = L \\frac{di(t)}{dt}</math>\n \nWhen there is a [[sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] (AC) through an inductor, a sinusoidal voltage is induced. The amplitude of the voltage is proportional to the product of the amplitude (''I''<sub>P</sub>) of the current and the frequency (''f'') of the current.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n              i(t) &= I_\\mathrm P \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\\n  \\frac{di(t)}{dt} &= I_\\mathrm P \\omega \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\\n              v(t) &= L I_\\mathrm P \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this situation, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the current lags that of the voltage by \u03c0/2 (90\u00b0). For sinusoids, as the voltage across the inductor goes to its maximum value, the current goes to zero, and as the voltage across the inductor goes to zero, the current through it goes to its maximum value.\n\nIf an inductor is connected to a direct current source with value ''I'' via a resistance ''R'' (at least the DCR of the inductor), and then the current source is short-circuited, the differential relationship above shows that the current through the inductor will discharge with an [[exponential decay]]:\n\n:<math>i(t) = I e^{-\\frac{R}{L}t}</math>\n\n===Reactance===\nThe ratio of the peak voltage to the peak current in an inductor energised from an AC source is called the [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and is denoted ''X''<sub>L</sub>.\n\n:<math>X_\\mathrm L = \\frac {V_\\mathrm P}{I_\\mathrm P} = \\frac {\\omega L I_\\mathrm P}{I_\\mathrm P} </math>\n\nThus,\n\n:<math>X_\\mathrm L = \\omega L </math>\n\nReactance is measured in ohms but referred to as ''impedance'' rather than resistance; energy is stored in the magnetic field as current rises and discharged as current falls.  Inductive reactance is proportional to frequency.  At low frequency the reactance falls; at DC, the inductor behaves as a short-circuit.  As frequency increases the reactance increases and at a sufficiently high frequency the reactance approaches that of an open circuit.\n\n===Corner frequency===\nIn filtering applications,with respect to a particular load impedance, an inductor has a [[corner frequency]] defined as:\n\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{3\\,dB} = \\frac{R}{2\\pi L}</math>\n\n===Laplace circuit analysis (s-domain)===\nWhen using the [[Laplace transform]] in circuit analysis, the impedance of an ideal inductor with no initial current is represented in the ''s'' domain by:\n:<math>Z(s) = Ls\\, </math>\n\nwhere\n: ''<math>L</math>'' is the inductance, and\n: ''<math>s</math>'' is the complex frequency.\n\nIf the inductor does have initial current, it can be represented by: {{bulleted list\n| adding a voltage source in series with the inductor, having the value:\n:<math> L I_0 \\,</math>\n\nwhere\n: ''<math>L</math>'' is the inductance, and\n: ''<math>I_0</math>'' is the initial current in the inductor.\n\n(''Note that the source should have a polarity that is aligned with the initial current'')\n\n| or by adding a current source in parallel with the inductor, having the value:\n:<math> \\frac{I_0}{s} </math>\n\nwhere\n: ''<math>I_0</math>'' is the initial current in the inductor.\n: ''<math>s</math>'' is the complex frequency.\n}}\n\n===Inductor networks===\n{{main|Series and parallel circuits}}\nInductors in a parallel configuration each have the same potential difference (voltage). To find their total equivalent inductance (''L''<sub>eq</sub>):\n\n: [[Image:inductors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several inductors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires]]\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{L_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{L_1} + \\frac{1}{L_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{L_n}</math>\n\nThe current through inductors in series stays the same, but the voltage across each inductor can be different. The sum of the potential differences (voltage) is equal to the total voltage. To find their total inductance:\n\n: [[Image:inductors in series.svg|A diagram of several inductors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each]]\n\n:<math> L_\\mathrm{eq} = L_1 + L_2 + \\cdots + L_n \\,\\! </math>\n\nThese simple relationships hold true only when there is no mutual coupling of magnetic fields between individual inductors.\n\n====Mutual inductance====\nMutual inductance occurs when the magnetic field of an inductor induces a magnetic field in an adjacent inductor.  Mutual induction is the basis of transformer construction.\n\n==Inductance formulas==\n{{See also|Inductance#Self-inductance of thin wire shapes}}\nThe table below lists some common simplified formulas for calculating the approximate inductance of several inductor constructions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n !

Some users may find that wearing the pump all the time (together with the infusion set tubing) is uncomfortable or unwieldy.\n* Possibility of insulin pump malfunctioning, and having to resort back to multiple daily injections until a replacement becomes available. However most pump manufacturers will usually have a program that will get a new pump to the user within 24 hours or allow the user to buy a second pump as a backup for a small fee. Additionally the pump itself will make many safety checks throughout the day, in some cases up to 4,000,000 and may have a second microprocessor dedicated to this.\n* Users may experience scar tissue buildup around the inserted cannula, resulting in a hard bump under the skin after the [[cannula]] is removed. The scar tissue does not heal particularly fast, so years of wearing the pump and changing the infusion site will cause the user to start running out of viable \"spots\" to wear the pump. In addition, the areas with scar tissue buildup generally have lower insulin sensitivity and may affect basal rates and bolus amounts. In some extreme cases the insulin delivery will appear to have no/little effect on lowering blood glucose levels and the site must be changed.\n* Users may experience allergic reactions and other skin irritation from the adhesive on the back of an infusion set. Experience may vary according to the individual, the pump manufacturer, and the type of infusion set used.\n* A larger supply of insulin may be required in order to use the pump. Many units of insulin can be \"wasted\" while refilling the pump's reservoir or changing an infusion site. This may affect prescription and dosage information.\n\n===Accessibility===\nUse of insulin pumps is increasing because of:\n* Easy delivery of multiple insulin injections for those using [[intensive insulin therapy]].\n* Accurate delivery of very small boluses, helpful for infants.\n* Growing support among doctors and insurance companies due to the benefits contributing to reducing the incidence of [[Diabetes mellitus#Complications|long-term complications]].\n* Improvements in [[blood glucose monitoring]].  New meters require smaller drops of blood, and the corresponding lancet poke in the fingers is smaller and less painful.  These meters also support [[blood glucose monitoring#Blood glucose meters|alternate site testing]] for the most routine tests for practically painless testing.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Early insulin pump.JPG|thumb|Early insulin pump]]\nIn 1963 Dr. Arnold Kadish designed the first insulin pump to be worn as a backpack.<ref>{{cite news|title=HISTORY OF PUMP TECHNOLOGY|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/460365_2|accessdate=8 April 2016|work=Medscape Multispecialty}}</ref> A more wearable version was later devised by [[Dean Kamen]] in 1976. Kamen formed a company called \"AutoSyringe\" to market the product, which he sold to Baxter Health Care in 1981.<ref>http://www.diabeteswellbeing.com/who-invented-the-insulin-pump.html</ref>\n\nThe insulin pump was first endorsed in the United Kingdom in 2003, by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)]].\n\n===Developments===\nNew insulin pumps are becoming \"smart\" as new features are added to their design.  These simplify the tasks involved in delivering an insulin bolus.\n*'''insulin on board''': This calculation is based on the size of a bolus, the time elapsed since the completion of the bolus, and a programmable metabolic rate.  The pump software will estimate the insulin remaining in the bloodstream and relay it to the user.  This supports the process of performing a new bolus before the effects of the last bolus are complete and, thereby, helps prevent the user from overcompensating for high blood sugar with unnecessary correction boluses.\n*'''bolus calculators''': Pump software helps by calculating the dose for the next insulin bolus.  The user enters the grams of carbohydrates to be consumed, and the bolus \"wizard\" calculates the units of insulin needed.  It adjusts for the most recent blood glucose level and the insulin on board, and then suggests the best insulin dose to the user to approve and deliver.\n*'''custom alarms''': The pump can monitor for activities during specific times of day and alarm the user if an expected activity did not occur.  Examples include a missed lunch bolus, a missed blood glucose test, a new blood glucose test 15 minutes after a low blood glucose test, etc.  The alarms are customized for each user.\n*'''touch bolus''': For persons with visual impairments, this button on the pump can be used to bolus for insulin without using the display.  This works with a system of beeps to confirm the bolus parameters to the pump user.  This feature is described as 'touch', 'audio', or 'easy' bolus depending on brand.  The feature was first introduced in the mid- to late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n*'''interface to personal computers''': Since the late 1990s, most pumps can interface with personal computers for managing and documenting pump programming and/or to upload data from the pump. This simplifies record keeping and can be interfaced with [[diabetes management software]].\n*'''integration with blood glucose meters''': Blood glucose data can be manually entered into the pump to support the bolus wizard for calculation of the next insulin bolus.  Some pumps support an interface between the insulin pump and a blood glucose meter.\n**The [[Medtronic Diabetes]] [[Minimed Paradigm]] series of insulin pumps allow for [[radio frequency]] (RF) communication. This enables the pump to receive data from a Lifescan (in the US) or Bayer (in other countries) blood glucose meter.\n**The Animas Ping is a pump/blood glucose meter combo that connect to each other using radio frequency. They both can work independently of each other and each have their own history storage. The main purpose of the connection between the pump and the meter is that it allows boluses to be made from the meter or the pump. This is particularly useful when correcting for a high blood sugar as the meter remembers readings and automatically enters them in correction boluses if they are less than 15 minutes old.\n** The DANA Diabecare IISG insulin pump has a blood glucose meter in it. After a blood glucose check with the integrated glucometer, the user can use the bolus wizard to deliver a required bolus.\n**The Insulet ''OmniPod'' has a separate remote, also known as a Personal Diabetes Monitor (PDM), that features a built-in meter that uses Freestyle test strips. This eliminates the need to carry and manage a separate meter or transfer blood glucose results from device to device.\n*'''integration with continuous glucose monitoring systems''': Some insulin pumps can be used as a display for interstitial glucose values obtained from a continuous glucose monitoring system or sensor.\n**The Minimed Paradigm series' RF link also supports a [[blood glucose monitoring#Continuous blood glucose monitoring|continuous blood glucose sensor]] known as the Paradigm REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitor that wirelessly provides an interstitial glucose value every 5 minutes on the pump screen. The Medtronic REAL-Time System was the first to link a continuous monitor with an insulin pump system. In the Minimed 530G with Enlite (in the US) or Paradigm Veo (in other countries), the pump can enter a low glucose suspend mode stopping all insulin delivery (bolus and basal insulin) if interstitial glucose values fall below the hypoglycemia threshold. In the Minimed 640G insulin pump series, low glucose suspend mode can also be entered based on predicted hypoglycemia.<ref>https://www.medtronic-diabetes.co.uk/minimed-system/minimed-640g-insulin-pump</ref>\n**The Animas Vibe is an insulin pump that is fully integrated with the Dexcom G4 Continuous Glucose Monitor. The two connect wirelessly to monitor and track blood glucose levels and detect patterns.  The Dexcom G4 has the advantage of being designed to monitor glucose levels every five minutes throughout 7 days of continuous wear.<ref>http://animascorp.co.uk/animas-vibe-and-cgm-system</ref> Although the Animas Vibe has been approved for use in Europe since 2011, it was just approved for use in Canada in January 2014 and approved for use in the United States in December 2014.<ref>http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1293917/animas-vibe-tm-insulin-pump-with-latest-dexcom-cgm-technology-now-available-in-canada-1</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/newsflash-animas-vibe-finally-gets-green-light-from-fda|title=NewsFlash: Animas Vibe (Finally) Gets Green Light from FDA|last=Hoskins|first=Mike|date=1 December 2014|work=Healthline.com|access-date=7 April 2016|via=}}</ref> NOTE: Animas insulin pumps are not available due to Johnson & Johnson's decision to cease operations at their Animas subsidiary.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Animas Closes Operations and Exits Insulin Pump Market|url= https://diatribe.org/animas-closes-operations-and-exits-insulin-pump-market |last=Brown |first=Adam |date= 17 October 2017 |work= Diatribe.org |access-date= 24 March 2018 }}</ref>\n*Other options may include remote control, tubeless pod, touch screen interface, rechargeable battery, pre-filled insulin cartridge.\n\n'''MiniMed 670G''' is a type of insulin pump and sensor system created by [[Medtronic]].

In event of hypoglycemia, the glucagon could be triggered to increase the blood glucose. This would be particularly valuable in a closed loop system under the control of a glucose sensor.

(Left to right) 1: Reservoir in sterile packaging. 2: Filling the reservoir. 3: Reservoir with needle and plunger removed, ready for attachment to infusion set.]]\n\n[[Image:standard bolus.JPG|thumb|right|300px]]\n[[Image:extended bolus.JPG|thumb|right|300px]]\n[[Image:combo bolus.JPG|thumb|right|300px]]\n[[Image:super bolus.JPG|thumb|right|300px]]\nAn insulin pump allows the replacement of slow-acting insulin for basal needs with a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin.\n\nThe insulin pump delivers a single type of rapid-acting insulin in two ways:<ref>http://www.diabetes.co.uk/insulin/Insulin-pumps.html Insulin pumps</ref>\n* a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] dose that is pumped to cover food eaten or to correct a high [[blood glucose]] level.\n* a [[basal (medicine)|basal]] dose that is pumped continuously at an adjustable [[basal rate]] to deliver insulin needed between meals and at night.\n\n===Bolus shape===\n\nAn insulin pump user can influence the profile of the rapid-acting insulin by shaping the bolus. Users can experiment with bolus shapes to determine what is best for any given food, which means that they can improve control of [[blood sugar]] by adapting the bolus shape to their needs.\n\nA '''standard bolus''' is an infusion of insulin pumped completely at the onset of the bolus.  It's the most similar to an injection.  By pumping with a \"spike\" shape, the expected action is the fastest possible bolus for that type of insulin.  The standard bolus is most appropriate when eating high carb low protein low fat meals because it will return blood sugar to normal levels quickly.\n\nAn '''extended bolus''' is a slow infusion of insulin spread out over time.  By pumping with a \"square wave\" shape, the bolus avoids a high initial dose of insulin that may enter the blood and cause low blood sugar before digestion can facilitate sugar entering the blood.  The extended bolus also extends the action of insulin well beyond that of the insulin alone.  The extended bolus is appropriate when covering high fat high protein meals such as steak, which will be raising blood sugar for many hours past the onset of the bolus.  The extended bolus is also useful for those with slow digestion (such as with [[gastroparesis]] or [[coeliac disease]]).\n\nA '''combination bolus'''/'''multiwave bolus''' is the combination of a standard bolus spike with an extended bolus square wave.  This shape provides a large dose of insulin up front, and then also extends the tail of the insulin action.  The combination bolus is appropriate for high carb high fat meals such as pizza, pasta with heavy cream sauce, and chocolate cake.\n\nA '''super bolus''' is a method of increasing the spike of the standard bolus.  Since the action of the bolus insulin in the blood stream will extend for several hours, the basal insulin could be stopped or reduced during this time.  This facilitates the \"borrowing\" of the basal insulin and including it into the bolus spike to deliver the same total insulin with faster action than can be achieved with spike and basal rate together.  The super bolus is useful for certain foods (like sugary breakfast cereals) which cause a large post-prandial peak of blood sugar.  It attacks the blood sugar peak with the fastest delivery of insulin that can be practically achieved by pumping.\n\n===Bolus timing===\nSince the pump user is responsible to manually start a bolus, this provides an opportunity for the user to pre-bolus to improve upon the insulin pump's capability to prevent post-prandial hyperglycemia.  A pre-bolus is simply a bolus of insulin given before it is actually needed to cover carbohydrates eaten.\n\nThere are two situations where a pre-bolus is helpful:\n#A pre-bolus of insulin will mitigate a spike in blood sugar that results from eating high glycemic foods.  Infused insulin analogs such as [[NovoLog]] and [[Apidra]] typically begin to reduce blood sugar levels 15 or 20 minutes after infusion.  As a result, easily digested sugars often hit the bloodstream much faster than infused insulin intended to cover them, and the blood sugar level spikes upward as a result.  If the bolus were infused 20 minutes before eating, then the pre-bolused insulin would hit the bloodstream simultaneously with the digested sugars to control the magnitude of the spike.\n#A pre-bolus of insulin can combine a meal bolus and a correction bolus when the blood sugar is above the target range before a meal.  The timing of the bolus is a controllable variable to bring down the blood sugar level before eating again causes it to increase.\n\nSimilarly, a low blood sugar level or a low glycemic food might be best treated with a bolus ''after'' a meal is begun.  The blood sugar level,  the type of food eaten, and a person's individual response to food and insulin affect the ideal time to bolus with the pump.\n\n===Basal rate patterns===\nThe pattern for delivering basal insulin throughout the day can also be customized with a pattern to suit the pump user.\n*A reduction of basal at night to prevent low blood sugar in infants and toddlers.\n*An increase of basal at night to counteract high blood sugar levels due to growth hormone in teenagers.\n*A pre-dawn increase to prevent high blood sugar due to the [[dawn effect]] in adults and teens.\n*In a proactive plan before regularly scheduled exercise times such as morning gym for elementary school children or after-school basketball practice for high school children.\n\n===Basal rate determination===\nBasal insulin requirements will vary between individuals and periods of the day. The basal rate for a particular time period is determined by fasting while periodically evaluating the blood sugar level. Neither food nor bolus insulin must be taken for 4 hours before or during the evaluation period. If the blood sugar level changes dramatically during evaluation, then the basal rate can be adjusted to increase or decrease insulin delivery to keep the blood sugar level approximately steady.\n\nFor instance, to determine an individual's morning basal requirement, they must skip breakfast. On waking, they would test their blood glucose level periodically until lunch. Changes in blood glucose level are compensated with adjustments in the morning basal rate.  The process is repeated over several days, varying the fasting period, until a 24-hour basal profile has been built up which keeps fasting blood sugar levels relatively steady. Once the basal rate is matched to the fasting basal insulin need, the pump user will then gain the flexibility to skip or postpone meals such as sleeping late on the weekends or working overtime on a weekday.\n\nMany factors can change insulin requirements and require an adjustment to the basal rate:\n* continued beta cell death following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes ([[Honeymoon period (diabetes)|honeymoon period]])\n* growth spurts particularly during [[puberty]]\n* weight gain or loss\n* any drug treatment that affects insulin sensitivity (e.g. [[corticosteroids]])\n* eating, sleeping, or exercise routine changes\n* whenever the control over hyperglycemia is degrading\n* and according to the seasons.\n\nA pump user should be educated by their diabetes care professional about basal rate determination before beginning pump therapy.\n\n===Temporary basal rates===\nSince the basal insulin is provided as a rapid-acting insulin, the basal insulin can be immediately increased or decreased as needed with a temporary basal rate.  Examples when this is helpful include:\n*As a passenger during a long car drive, when more insulin is needed due to inactivity.\n*While driving on an extended trip, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, a lower temporary basal rate may be programmed.\n*During and after spontaneous exercise or sports activities, when the body needs less insulin.\n*During illness or stress, when basal demand increases due to [[insulin resistance]].\n*When blood [[ketone bodies|ketones]] are present, when additional insulin is needed.\n*When on an extended fast (such as Ramadan, Lent, or Yom Kippur) when basal requirements may be lower.\n*During [[menses]], when additional basal insulin is needed.\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Security===\nIn August 2011, an [[IBM]] researcher, Jay Radcliffe, demonstrated a security flaw in insulin pumps.

This newer approach contrasts with [[conventional insulin therapy]].  Rather than minimize the number of insulin injections per day (a technique which demands a rigid schedule for food and activities), the intensive approach favors flexible meal times with variable carbohydrate as well as flexible physical activities.  The trade-off is the increase from 2 or 3 injections per day to 4 or more injections per day, which was considered \"intensive\" relative to the older approach. In North America in 2004, many endocrinologists prefer the term \"flexible insulin therapy\" (FIT) to \"intensive therapy\" and use it to refer to any method of replacing [[insulin]] that attempts to mimic the pattern of small continuous basal insulin secretion of a working pancreas combined with larger insulin secretions at mealtimes. The semantic distinction reflects changing treatment.\n\n==Rationale==\nLong-term studies like the [[UK Prospective Diabetes Study]] (''UKPDS'') and the [[Diabetes control and complications trial]] (''DCCT'') showed that intensive insulin therapy achieved blood glucose levels closer to non-diabetic people and that this was associated with reduced frequency and severity of blood vessel damage. Damage to large and small blood vessels ([[macroangiopathy|macro-]] and [[microvascular disease]]) is central to the development of [[diabetes mellitus#Complications|complications of diabetes mellitus]].\n\nThis evidence convinced most physicians who specialize in diabetes care that an important goal of treatment is to make the biochemical profile of the diabetic patient ([[blood lipids]], [[Glycosylated hemoglobin|HbA1c]], etc.) as close to the values of non-diabetic people as possible. This is especially true for young patients with many decades of life ahead.\n\n==General description==\nA working pancreas continually secretes small amounts of insulin into the blood to maintain normal glucose levels, which would otherwise rise from glucose release by the liver, especially during the early morning [[dawn phenomenon]].  This insulin is referred to as ''basal insulin secretion'', and constitutes almost half<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=PC|title=Analysis of guidelines for basal-bolus insulin dosing: basal insulin, correction factor, and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio|pmid=19158048|doi=10.4158/EP.14.9.1095|volume=14|issue=9|journal=Endocr Pract|pages=1095\u2013101}}</ref> the insulin produced by the normal pancreas.\n\nBolus insulin is produced during the digestion of meals. Insulin levels rise immediately as we begin to eat, remaining higher than the basal rate for 1 to 4 hours. This meal-associated (''prandial'') insulin production is roughly proportional to the amount of carbohydrate in the meal.\n\nIntensive or flexible therapy involves supplying a continual supply of insulin to serve as the ''basal insulin'', supplying meal insulin in doses proportional to nutritional load of the meals, and supplying extra insulin when needed to correct high glucose levels. These three components of the insulin regimen are commonly referred to as basal insulin, bolus insulin, and high glucose correction insulin.\n\n===Two common regimens: pens, injection ports, and pumps===\nOne method of intensive insulinotherapy is based on multiple daily injections (sometimes referred to in medical literature as ''MDI''). Meal insulin is supplied by injection of rapid-acting insulin before each meal in an amount proportional to the meal. Basal insulin is provided as a once or twice daily injection of dose of a long-acting insulin.\n\nIn an MDI regimen, long-acting insulins are preferred for basal use. An older insulin used for this purpose is ultralente, and beef ultralente in particular was considered for decades to be the gold standard of basal insulin.  Long-acting [[insulin analog]]s such as [[insulin glargine]] (brand name ''Lantus'', made by [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) and [[insulin detemir]] (brand name ''Levemir'', made by [[Novo Nordisk]]) are also used, with insulin glargine used more than insulin detemir.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  Rapid-acting insulin analogs such as [[Insulin lispro|lispro]] (brand name ''Humalog'', made by [[Eli Lilly and Company]]) and [[Insulin aspart|aspart]] (brand name ''Novolog''/''Novorapid'', made by Novo Nordisk and ''Apidra'' made by Sanofi Aventis) are preferred by many clinicians over older regular insulin for meal coverage and high correction. Many people on MDI regimens carry [[insulin pen]]s to inject their rapid-acting insulins instead of traditional [[syringe]]s.  Some people on an MDI regimen also use [[injection port]]s such as the [[injection port#I-Port|I-port]] to minimize the number of daily skin punctures.\n\nThe other method of intensive/flexible insulin therapy is an [[insulin pump]]. It is a small mechanical device about the size of a deck of cards. It contains a syringe-like reservoir with about three days' insulin supply. This is connected by thin, disposable, plastic tubing to a needle-like [[cannula]] inserted into the patient's skin and held in place by an adhesive patch. The infusion tubing and cannula must be removed and replaced every few days.\n\nAn insulin pump can be programmed to infuse a steady amount of rapid-acting insulin under the skin. This steady infusion is termed the basal rate and is designed to supply the background insulin needs. Each time the patient eats, he or she must press a button on the pump to deliver a specified dose of insulin to cover that meal. Extra insulin is also given the same way to correct a high glucose reading. Although current pumps can include a glucose sensor, they cannot automatically respond to meals or to rising or falling glucose levels.\n\nBoth MDI and pumping can achieve similarly excellent glycemic control. Some people prefer injections because they are less expensive than pumps and do not require the wearing of a continually attached device.  However, the clinical literature is very clear that patients whose basal insulin requirements tend not to vary throughout the day or do not require dosage precision smaller than 0.5 IU, are much less likely to realize much significant advantage of pump therapy.  Another perceived advantage of pumps is the freedom from syringes and injections, however, infusion sets still require less frequent injections to guide infusion sets into the subcutaneous tissue.\n\nIntensive/flexible insulin therapy requires frequent blood glucose checking. To achieve the best balance of blood sugar with either intensive/flexible method, a patient must check his or her glucose level with a meter [[blood glucose monitoring|monitoring of blood glucose]] several times a day. This allows optimization of the basal insulin and meal coverage as well as correction of high glucose episodes.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\nThe two primary advantages of intensive/flexible therapy over more traditional two or three injection regimens are: \n# greater flexibility of meal times, carbohydrate quantities, and physical activities, and\n# better glycemic control to reduce the incidence and severity of the complications of diabetes.\n\nMajor disadvantages of intensive/flexible therapy are that it requires greater amounts of education and effort to achieve the goals, and it increases the daily cost for glucose monitoring four or more times a day.  This cost can substantially increase when the therapy is implemented with an insulin pump and/or continuous glucose monitor.\n\nIt is a common notion that more frequent hypoglycemia is a disadvantage of intensive/flexible regimens.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n|author=The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. |journal=N Engl J Med \n|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/329/14/977|accessdate=2008-01-08|pmid=8366922|doi=10.1056/NEJM199309303291401|year=1993|volume=329|pages=977\u201386|issue=14}}</ref> The frequency of hypoglycemia increases with increasing effort to achieve normal blood glucoses with most insulin regimens, but hypoglycemia can be minimized with appropriate glucose targets and control strategies. The difficulties lie in remembering to test, estimating meal size, taking the meal bolus and eating within the prescribed time, and being aware of snacks and meals that are not the expected size. When implemented correctly, flexible regimens offer greater ability to achieve good glycemic control with easier accommodation to variations of eating and physical activity.\n\n==Semantics of changing care: why \"flexible\" is replacing \"intensive\" therapy==\nOver the last two decades, the evidence that better glycemic control (i.e., keeping blood glucose and HbA1c levels as close to normal as possible) reduces the rates of many complications of diabetes has become overwhelming. As a result, diabetes specialists have expended increasing effort to help most people with diabetes achieve blood glucose levels as close to normal as achievable. It takes about the same amount of effort to achieve good glycemic control with a traditional two or three injection regimen as it does with flexible therapy: frequent glucose monitoring, attention to timing and amounts of meals.  Many diabetes specialists no longer think of flexible insulin therapy as \"intensive\" or \"special\" treatment for a select group of patients but simply as standard care for most patients with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]].\n\n==Treatment devices used==\nThe [[insulin pump]] is one device used in intensive insulinotherapy. The insulin pump is about the size of a beeper. It can be programmed to send a steady stream of insulin as ''basal insulin''. It contains a reservoir or cartridge holding several days' worth of insulin, the tiny battery-operated pump, and the computer chip that regulates how much insulin is pumped. The infusion set is a thin plastic tube with a fine needle at the end. There are also newer \"pods\" which do not require tubing.  It carries the insulin from the pump to the infusion site beneath the skin. It sends a larger amount before eating meals as \"bolus\" doses.\n\nThe insulin pump replaces insulin injections. This device is useful for people who regularly forget to inject themselves or for people who don't like injections. This machine does the injecting by replacing the slow-acting insulin for basal needs with an ongoing infusion of rapid-acting insulin.\n\nBasal insulin: the insulin that controls blood glucose levels between meals and overnight. It controls glucose in the fasting state.\n\nBoluses: the insulin that is released when food is eaten or to correct a high reading.\n\nAnother device used in intensive insulinotherapy is the [[injection port]].  An injection port is a small disposable device, similar to the infusion set used with an insulin pump, configured to accept a syringe.  Standard insulin injections are administered through the injection port.  When using an injection port, the syringe needle always stays above the surface of the skin, thus reducing the number of skin punctures associated with intensive insulinotheraphy.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links and resources==\n{{Diabetes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Intensive Insulinotherapy}}\n[[Category:Eli Lilly and Company]]\n[[Category:Insulin therapies]]\n\n[[pl:Insulinoterapia]]", "sha1": "52d75wuy5dl6u7oapyrprwebr00w72f"}}, {"title": "Interwiki links", "ns": "0", "id": "14906", "revision": {"id": "853109942", "parentid": "847553895", "timestamp": "2018-08-02T14:03:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "DavidCary", "id": "39203"}, "comment": "yet another very similar notation syntax", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Selfref|For interwiki related to the Wikimedia projects, see [[Help:Interwikimedia links]] and [[Help:Interlanguage links]].}}\n{{Selfref|For a huge interwiki map by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], see [[m:Interwiki map]].}}\n\n[[File:Screenshot showing interwikilink removal.JPG|thumb|[[Screenshot]] showing interwiki link removal]]\n\n'''Interwiki linking''' (''W-link'') is a facility for creating [[hyperlink|link]]s to the many [[wiki]]s on the [[World Wide Web]]. Users avoid pasting in entire [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] (as they would for regular web pages) and instead use a [[shorthand]] similar to links within the same wiki (intrawiki links).\n\nUnlike [[domain name]]s on the Internet, there is no globally defined list of interwiki prefixes, so owners of a wiki must define an '''interwiki map''' (InterMap) appropriate to their needs.  Users generally have to create separate accounts for each wiki they intend to use (unless they intend to edit anonymously).  Variations in text formatting and layout can also hinder a seamless transition from one wiki to the next.\n\nBy making wiki links simpler to type for the members of a particular community, these features help bring the different wikis closer together. Furthering that goal, interwiki \"bus tours\" (similar to [[webring]]s) have been created to explain the purposes and highlights of different wikis. Such examples on [[Wikipedia]] include {{srlink|Wikipedia:TourBusStop}} and {{srlink|Wikipedia:WikiNode}}.\n\n== Syntax ==\nInterwiki link notation varies, depending largely on the syntax a wiki uses for markup. The two most common link patterns in wikis are [[CamelCase]] and free links (arbitrary phrases surrounded by some set [[delimiter]], such as <nowiki>[[double square brackets]]</nowiki>). [[CURIE]] syntax -an emerging W3C standard- uses a single set of square brackets.\n\nInterwiki links on a CamelCase-based wiki frequently take the form of \"Code:PageName\", where ''Code'' is the defined InterMap prefix for another wiki. Thus, a link \"WikiPedia:InterWiki\" could be rendered in [[HTML]] as a link to an article on Wikipedia: for example, {{srlink|Wikipedia:Interlanguage links}}. Linking from a CamelCase-wiki to a page that contains spaces in its title typically requires replacing the spaces with underscores (e.g. WikiPedia:Main_Page).\n\nInterwiki links on wikis based on free links, such as Wikipedia, typically follow the same principle, but using the delimiters that would be used for internal links. These links can then be parsed and escaped as they would be if they were internal, allowing easier typing of spaces but potentially causing problems with other special characters. For example, on Wikipedia, <code><nowiki>[[MeatBall:AssumeGoodFaith]]</nowiki></code> appears as [[MeatBall:AssumeGoodFaith]], and  <code><nowiki>[[:de:InterWiki]]</nowiki></code> (former syntax: <code><nowiki>[[DeWikipedia:InterWiki]]</nowiki></code>) appears as [[:de:InterWiki]].\n\nThe [[MediaWiki]] software has an additional feature which uses similar notation to create automatic interlanguage links \u2014 for instance, the link <code><nowiki>[[de:InterWiki]]</nowiki></code> (with no leading colon) automatically creates a reference labeled \"Other languages: [[:de:InterWiki|Deutsch]] | ...\" at the top and bottom of, or in a sidebar next to, the article display. Various other [[wiki software]] systems have features for \"semi-internal\" links of this kind, such as support for [[namespace]]s or multiple sub-communities.\n\nMost InterMap implementations simply replace the interwiki prefix with a full URL prefix, so many non-wiki websites can also be referred to using the system. A reference to a definition on the [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]], for instance, could take the form <code><nowiki>[[Foldoc:foo]]</nowiki></code> which would tell the system to append and display the link as [http://foldoc.org/foldoc.cgi?foo Foldoc:foo].  This makes it very easy to link to commonly referenced resources from within a wiki page, without the need to even know the form of the URL in question.\n\nThe interwiki concept can equally be applied to links ''from'' non-wiki websites. [[Advogato]], for instance, offers a syntax for creating shorthand links based on a MeatBall-derived InterMap.\n\n[[WordPress]] offers a similar \"shortcode\" shorthand notation for embedding images, videos, LaTeX formulas and equations, maps, etc. hosted on other websites.<ref>\n[https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/ \"What is a shortcode?\"]\n</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nInternally, a wiki that uses interwiki links needs to have a mapping from wiki-code links to full URLs. For example, <code><nowiki>[[MeatBall:InterWiki]]</nowiki></code> might appear as [[MeatBall:InterWiki]], but link to <code>http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InterWiki</code>.\n\nSince most wiki systems use URLs for individual pages where the page's title appears at the end of an otherwise unchanging address, the simplest way of defining such mappings is by substituting the interwiki prefix for the unchanging part of the URL. So in the example above, the <code>MeatBall:</code> has simply been replaced by <code><nowiki>http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?</nowiki></code> in creating the target of the [[HTML]] rendered link.\n\nRather than creating a new list from scratch for every wiki, it is often useful to obtain a copy of that from another site. Sites such as [[MeatballWiki]] [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InterMap] and the [[UseModWiki]] site contain comprehensive lists which are often used for this purpose - the former being publicly editable in the same way as any other wiki page, and the latter being verified as usable but potentially out of date. MediaWiki's default list of interwiki links is derived from an old version of MeatballWiki's list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.list?view=markup |title=[mediawiki&#93; Contents of /trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.list |publisher=Svn.wikimedia.org |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.sql?view=markup |title=[mediawiki&#93; Contents of /trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.sql |publisher=Svn.wikimedia.org |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Wikipedia:InterWikimedia links]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Wikimedia sister projects]]\n* [[Help:Interlanguage links]]\n* [[Wiktionary]]\n** [[wiktionary:interwiki]]\n* [[Wikimedia Meta-Wiki]]\n** [[meta:Help:Interwiki linking]]\n* [[Wikimedia Commons]]\n** [[commons:Category:CommonsRoot]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Dan Woods, Peter Thoeny, ''Wikis for Dummies'', [[For Dummies]], 2007, {{ISBN|0-470-04399-7}}, p.&nbsp;140\n* Daniel J.

Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,\n:<math>g(y) = \\frac{y + 7}{5}.</math>\nWith {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' \u2212 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.\n\nNot all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} to have an inverse,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/> it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range (mathematics)|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}.

For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''<sup> \u22121</sup>(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are bijections.\n\nThere is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the \"set-theoretic\" or \"graph\" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}</ref> Under this convention all functions are surjections,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection.

With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIf the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.<ref>{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}</ref> The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.\n<!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. \n===Inverses in higher mathematics===\nThe definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation\n:<math>f\\colon X \\to Y </math>\nmeans \"{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y\u2009}}\".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}</ref>\n\nWhen using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}.\n-->\n\n==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===\n{{See also|Inverse element}}\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then\n\n:<math> f^{-1}\\left( \\, f(x) \\, \\right) = x</math>, for every <math>x \\in X. </math>\n\nUsing the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:\n\n:<math> f^{-1} \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|id<sub>''X''</sub>}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged.

As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function.

For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} \u2192 '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1}\u200a}}.\n\nA '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} such that\n\n:<math>f \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_Y . </math>\n\nThat is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule\n\n:If <math>\\displaystyle h(y) = x</math>, then <math>\\displaystyle f(x) = y .</math>\n\nThus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).\n\nAn inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &rarr; {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}} &rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' \u2265 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(\u22121)) = 1 \u2260 \u22121}}.\n\n===Preimages===\nIf {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) = y \\right\\} . </math>\n\nThe preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.\n\nSimilarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(S) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in S \\right\\} . </math>\n\nFor example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. This function is not invertible for reasons discussed [[#Example: squaring and square root functions|above]]. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\left\\{1,4,9,16\\right\\}) = \\left\\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\\right\\}</math>\n\nThe preimage of a single element {{math| ''y'' &isin; ''Y''}} \u2013 a [[singleton set]] {{math|{''y''}\u200a}} \u2013 is sometimes called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of {{mvar|y}}.  When {{mvar|Y}} is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>({''y''})}} as a ''[[level set]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lagrange inversion theorem]], gives the Taylor series expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function\n* [[Inverse Fourier transform]]\n* [[Reversible computing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">It is a common practice, when no ambiguity can arise, to leave off the term function and just refer to an inverse.</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\">Not to be confused with numerical exponentiation such as taking the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number.</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\">So this term is never used in this convention.</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Keisler\">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/chapter_2a.pdf |format=PDF |title=Differentiation |author-last=Keisler |author-first=Howard Jerome |author-link=Howard Jerome Keisler |access-date=2015-01-24 |quote=\u00a72.4}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Scheinerman_2013\">{{cite book |author-last=Scheinerman |author-first=Edward R. |author-link=Edward R.

This includes changes to the object's [[speed]], or [[Relative direction|direction]] of motion. \n\nAn aspect of this property is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed, when no forces are upon them \u2014 and this aspect in particular is also called inertia.\n\nThe principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles in [[classical physics]] that are still used today to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by the applied [[force]]s on them. \n\nInertia comes from the Latin word, ''iners'', meaning idle, sluggish. Inertia is one of the primary manifestations of [[mass]], which is a quantitative property of [[physical system]]s. [[Isaac Newton]] defined inertia as his first law in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which states: <ref>Andrew Motte's English translation:{{Citation| last = Newton| first = Isaac| title = Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy| publisher = Daniel Adee| year = 1846| location = New York| url = https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich| pages= 72}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The ''vis insita'', or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line.<!--There is a citation in the text immediately preceding the quote.-->}}\n\nIn common usage, the term \"inertia\" may refer to an object's \"amount of resistance to change in velocity\" (which is quantified by its mass), or sometimes to its [[momentum]], depending on the context.  The term \"inertia\" is more properly understood as shorthand for \"the principle of inertia\" as described by Newton in his [[Newton's laws of motion|First Law of Motion]]: an object not subject to any net external force moves at a constant velocity. Thus, an object will continue moving at its current [[velocity]] until some force causes its speed or direction to change.\n\nOn the surface of the Earth, inertia is often masked by the effects of [[friction]] and [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]], both of which tend to decrease the speed of moving objects (commonly to the point of rest), and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. This misled the philosopher [[Aristotle]] to believe that objects would move only as long as force was applied to them:<ref>{{Citation| last =  Aristotle: Minor works| title = ''Mechanical Problems'' (''Mechanica'')| publisher =  Loeb Classical Library Cambridge (Mass.) and London| year = 1936| location = [[University of Chicago Library]]| url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Aristotle/Mechanica*.html | pages= 407}}</ref><ref>Pages 2 to 4, Section 1.1, \"Skating\", Chapter 1, \"Things that Move\", Louis Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the [[University of Virginia]], ''How Everything Works: Making Physics Out of the Ordinary'', John Wiley & Sons (2007), hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0-471-74817-5}}</ref>\n{{quote|...it [body] stops when the force which is pushing the travelling object has no longer power to push it along...}}\n\n==History and development of the concept==\n\n===Early understanding of motion===\nPrior to the [[Renaissance]], the most generally accepted theory of motion in [[Western philosophy]] was based on [[Aristotle]]  who around about 335 BC to 322 BC said that, in the absence of an external motive power, all objects (on Earth) would come to rest and that moving objects only continue to move so long as there is a power inducing them to do so. Aristotle explained the continued motion of projectiles, which are separated from their projector, by the action of the surrounding medium, which continues to move the projectile in some way.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'', 8.10, 267a1\u201321; [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8ph/ Aristotle, ''Physics'', trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129111002/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8ph/ |date=2007-01-29 }}.</ref>  Aristotle concluded that such violent motion in a void was impossible.<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'', 4.8, 214b29\u2013215a24.</ref>\n\nDespite its general acceptance, Aristotle's concept of motion was disputed on several occasions by notable philosophers over nearly two [[millennia]]. For example, [[Lucretius]] (following, presumably, [[Epicurus]]) stated that the \"default state\" of matter was motion, not stasis.<ref>Lucretius, ''On the Nature of Things'' (London: Penguin, 1988), pp. 60\u201365</ref>  In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] criticized the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where the medium would hinder a body's motion. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of a surrounding medium, but by some property imparted to the object when it was set in motion. Although this was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for a power to keep a body in motion, it proved a fundamental step in that direction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorabji|first=Richard|title=Matter, space and motion : theories in antiquity and their sequel|date=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0801421945|edition=1st |pages=227&mdash;228}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=Darling_2006>{{Cite book | last = Darling  | first = David  | title = Gravity's arc: the story of gravity, from Aristotle to Einstein and beyond  | publisher = John Wiley and Sons  | date = 2006  | pages =  17, 50 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nh3zEV_2N4EC&pg=PA50 | isbn = 978-0-471-71989-2}}</ref>  This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroes]] and by many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle. However, this view did not go unchallenged in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]], where Philoponus did have several supporters who further developed his ideas.\n\n===Theory of impetus===\n{{Main|Theory of impetus}}\n{{See also|Conatus}}\n\nIn the 14th century, [[Jean Buridan]] rejected the notion that a motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus.<ref>Jean Buridan: Quaestiones on Aristotle's Physics (quoted at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105959/http://brahms.phy.vanderbilt.edu/a203/impetus_theory.html Impetus Theory])</ref> Buridan also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also believed that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects (such as celestial bodies) to move in a circle.\n\nBuridan's thought was followed up by his pupil [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] (1316\u20131390) and the [[Oxford Calculators]], who performed various experiments that further undermined the classical, Aristotelian view. Their work in turn was elaborated by [[Nicole Oresme]] who pioneered the practice of demonstrating laws of motion in the form of graphs.\n\nShortly before Galileo's theory of inertia, [[Giambattista Benedetti]] modified the growing theory of impetus to involve linear motion alone:\n\n{{quote|\"\u2026[Any] portion of corporeal matter which moves by itself when an impetus has been impressed on it by any external motive force has a natural tendency to move on a rectilinear, not a curved, path.\"<ref>Giovanni Benedetti, selection from ''Speculationum'', in [[Stillman Drake]] and I. E. Drabkin, ''Mechanics in Sixteenth Century Italy'' [[University of Wisconsin Press]], 1969, p. 156.</ref>}}\n\nBenedetti cites the motion of a rock in a sling as an example of the inherent linear motion of objects, forced into circular motion.\n\n===Classical inertia===\n[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Galileo Galilei]]\nThe principle of inertia which originated with Aristotle for \"motions in a void\" states that an object tends to resist a change in motion. According to Newton, an object will stay at rest or stay in motion (i.e. \"maintain its velocity\") unless acted on by a net external force, whether it results from [[gravity]], [[friction]], contact, or some other force. The Aristotelian division of motion into mundane and celestial became increasingly problematic in the face of the conclusions of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in the 16th century, who argued that the earth (and everything on it) was in fact never \"at rest\", but was actually in constant motion around the sun.<ref>Nicholas Copernicus, [http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html ''The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres''], 1543</ref> [[Galileo]], in his further development of the [[Copernican model]], recognized these problems with the then-accepted nature of motion and, at least partially as a result, included a restatement of Aristotle's description of motion in a void as a basic physical principle:\n\n<blockquote>A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at a constant speed unless disturbed.<ref>For a detailed analysis concerning this issue, see Alan Chalmers article \"Galliean Relativity and Galileo's Relativity\", in ''Correspondence, Invariance and Heuristics: Essays in Hounour of Heinz Post'', eds. Steven French and Harmke Kamminga, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1991, {{ISBN|0792320859}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nGalileo writes that \"all external impediments removed, a heavy body on a spherical surface concentric with the earth will maintain itself in that state in which it has been; if placed in movement towards the west (for example), it will maintain itself in that movement.\"<ref>Drake, S. ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'', Doubleday Anchor, New York, 1957, pp. 113\u2013114</ref> This notion which is termed \"circular inertia\" or \"horizontal circular inertia\" by historians of science, is a precursor to, but distinct from, Newton's notion of rectilinear inertia.<ref>See Alan Chalmers article \"Galliean Relativity and Galileo's Relativity\", in ''Correspondence, Invariance and Heuristics: Essays in Hounour of Heinz Post'', eds. Steven French and Harmke Kamminga, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1991, pp. 199\u2013200, {{ISBN|0792320859}}. Chalmers does not, however, believe that Galileo's physics had a general principle of inertia, circular or otherwise.</ref><ref>Dijksterhuis E.J. ''The Mechanisation of the World Picture'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1961, p. 352</ref>  For Galileo, a motion is \"[[horizontal and vertical|horizontal]]\" if it does not carry the moving body towards or away from the centre of the earth, and for him, \"a ship, for instance, having once received some impetus through the tranquil sea, would move continually around our globe without ever stopping.\"<ref>Galileo, ''Letters on Sunspots'', 1613 quoted in Drake, S. ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'', Doubleday Anchor, New York, 1957, pp. 113\u2013114.</ref><ref>According to Newtonian mechanics, if a projectile on a smooth spherical planet is given an initial horizontal impetus, it will not remain on the surface of the earth. Various curves are possible depending on the initial speed and the height of launch. See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268. If constrained to remain on the surface, by being sandwiched, say, in between two concentric spheres, it will follow a great circle on the surface of the earth, i.e. will only maintain a westerly direction if fired along the equator. See \"Using great circles\" [http://www.physics.oregonstate.edu/~mcintyre/COURSES/ph429_S06/slides.pdf Using great circles]</ref>\n\nIt is also worth noting that Galileo later (in 1632) concluded that based on this initial premise of inertia, it is impossible to tell the difference between a moving object and a stationary one without some outside reference to compare it against.<ref>Galileo, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', 1632 ([http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html full text]).</ref>  This observation ultimately came to be the basis for [[Einstein]] to develop the theory of [[Special Relativity]].\n\nThe first physicist to completely break away from the Aristotelian model of motion was [[Isaac Beeckman]] in 1614.<ref>{{Citation| last = van Berkel| first = Klaas| title = Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion: Mechanical Philosophy in the Making| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2013| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D3WTX-23UVEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false| pages= 105\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nConcepts of inertia in Galileo's writings would later come to be refined, modified and codified by [[Isaac Newton]] as the first of his [[Newton's laws of motion|Laws of Motion]] (first published in Newton's work, ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in 1687):\n\n<blockquote>Unless acted upon by a net unbalanced force, an object will maintain a constant velocity.</blockquote>\n\nNote that \"velocity\" in this context is defined as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], thus Newton's \"constant velocity\" implies both constant speed and constant direction (and also includes the case of zero speed, or no motion).  Since initial publication, Newton's Laws of Motion (and by inclusion, this first law) have come to form the basis for the branch of [[physics]] known as [[classical mechanics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/8.01t/www/coursedocs/current/guide.htm|title=Classical Mechanics: MIT 8.01 Course Notes|last=Dourmaskin|first=Peter|date=December 2013|website=MIT Physics 8.01|publisher=|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"inertia\" was first introduced by [[Johannes Kepler]] in his ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]''<ref>Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, \"Inertia.\"</ref> (published in three parts from 1617\u20131621); however, the meaning of Kepler's term (which he derived from the Latin word for \"idleness\" or \"laziness\") was not quite the same as its modern interpretation.  Kepler defined inertia only in terms of a resistance to movement, once again based on the presumption that rest was a natural state which did not need explanation.  It was not until the later work of Galileo and Newton unified rest and motion in one principle that the term \"inertia\" could be applied to these concepts as it is today.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nNevertheless, despite defining the concept so elegantly in his laws of motion, even Newton did not actually use the term \"inertia\" to refer to his First Law.  In fact, Newton originally viewed the phenomenon he described in his First Law of Motion as being caused by \"innate forces\" inherent in matter, which resisted any acceleration. Given this perspective, and borrowing from Kepler, Newton attributed the term \"inertia\" to mean \"the innate force possessed by an object which resists changes in motion\"; thus, Newton defined \"inertia\" to mean the cause of the phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. However, Newton's original ideas of \"innate resistive force\" were ultimately problematic for a variety of reasons, and thus most physicists no longer think in these terms. As no alternate mechanism has been readily accepted, and it is now generally accepted that there may not be one which we can know, the term \"inertia\" has come to mean simply the phenomenon itself, rather than any inherent mechanism. Thus, ultimately, \"inertia\" in modern classical physics has come to be a name for the same phenomenon described by Newton's First Law of Motion, and the two concepts are now considered to be equivalent.\n\n===Relativity===\n[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], as proposed in his 1905 paper entitled \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" was built on the understanding of inertia and [[inertial reference frames]] developed by Galileo and Newton. While this revolutionary theory did significantly change the meaning of many Newtonian concepts such as [[mass]], [[energy]], and [[distance]], Einstein's concept of inertia remained unchanged from Newton's original meaning (in fact, the entire theory was based on Newton's definition of inertia). However, this resulted in a limitation inherent in special relativity: the [[principle of relativity]] could only apply to reference frames that were ''inertial'' in nature (meaning when no acceleration was present). In an attempt to address this limitation, Einstein proceeded to develop his [[general theory of relativity]] (\"The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity,\" 1916), which ultimately provided a unified theory for both ''inertial'' and ''noninertial'' (accelerated) reference frames. However, in order to accomplish this, in general relativity, Einstein found it necessary to redefine several fundamental concepts (such as gravity) in terms of a new concept of \"curvature\" of [[space-time]], instead of the more traditional system of forces understood by Newton.<ref>Alfred Engel English Translation:{{Citation| last = Einstein| first = Albert| title = The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity| publisher = Princeton University Press| year = 1997| location = New Jersey| url = http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Einstein_GRelativity_1916.pdf| pages = 57| accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of this redefinition, Einstein also redefined the concept of \"inertia\" in terms of [[geodesic deviation]] instead, with some subtle but significant additional implications. The result of this is that, according to general relativity, inertia is the gravitational coupling between matter and spacetime.\n\nWhen dealing with very large scales, the traditional Newtonian idea of \"inertia\" does not actually apply and cannot necessarily be relied upon. Luckily, for sufficiently small regions of spacetime, the special theory can be used and ''inertia'' still means the same (and works the same) as in the classical model.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother profound conclusion of the theory of special relativity\u2014perhaps the most well known\u2014was that energy and mass are not separate things but are, in fact, interchangeable. But this new relationship also carried with it new implications for the concept of inertia. The logical conclusion of special relativity was that if mass exhibits the principle of inertia, then inertia must also apply to energy. This theory, and subsequent experiments confirming some of its conclusions, have also served to radically expand the meaning of inertia to apply more widely and to include inertia of energy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Interpretations==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Mass and inertia===\n[[File:01.\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438.ogv|thumb|280px|Suspended weight showing inertia. The weight is suspended on a string, and has another string hanging from it. If the string is pulled quickly, only the bottom string is detached, and the weight remains hanging because of its inability to react in time (its inertness). If the same bottom string is pulled more slowly, the entire assembly falls down.]]\n\n[[Physicists]] and [[mathematicians]] appear to be less inclined to use the popular concept of inertia as \"a tendency to maintain momentum\" and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure of a body's resistance to changes in velocity or simply a body's inertial mass.\n\nThis was clear at the beginning of the 20th century, before the advent of the [[theory of relativity]]. Mass, ''m'', denoted something like an amount of substance or quantity of matter. At the same time, mass was the quantitative measure of inertia of a body.\n\nThe mass of a body determines the momentum, <math>p</math>, of the body at given velocity, <math>v</math>; it is a proportionality factor in the formula:\n\n:<math>p = mv</math>\n\nThe factor ''m'' is referred to as [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]].\n\nBut mass, as related to the \"inertia\" of a body, can also be defined by the formula:\n\n:<math>F = ma,</math>\n\nwhere ''F'' is the force, ''m'' is the inertial mass, and ''a'' is the acceleration.\n\nBy this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under a given force. The masses defined by the above formulas are equal because the latter formula is a consequence of the former, if mass does not depend on time and velocity. Thus, \"mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated\".\n\nThis meaning of a ''body's inertia'' therefore is altered from the popular meaning as \"a tendency to maintain momentum\" to a description of the measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of a body, but it is consistent with the fact that motion in one reference frame can disappear in another, so it is the change in velocity that is important.\n\n===Inertial mass===\n{{anchor|gravitational mass}}\nThere is no measurable difference between gravitational mass and inertial mass. The gravitational mass is defined by the quantity of gravitational field material a mass possesses, including its energy. The \"inertial mass\" (relativistic mass) is a function of the acceleration a mass has undergone and its resultant speed. A mass that has been accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light has its \"relativistic mass\" increased, and that is why the magnetic field strength in particle accelerators must be increased to force the mass's path to curve. In practice, \"inertial mass\" is normally taken to be \"invariant mass\" and so is identical to gravitational mass without the energy component.\n\nGravitational mass is measured by comparing the force of gravity of an unknown mass to the force of [[gravity]] of a known mass. This is typically done with some sort of balance. Equal masses will match on a balance because the gravitational field applies to them equally, producing identical weight. This assumption breaks down near supermassive objects such as black holes and neutron stars due to [[tidal force|tidal effects]]. It also breaks down in weightless environments, because no matter what objects are compared, it will yield a balanced reading.\n\nInertial mass is found by applying a known net force to an unknown mass, measuring the resulting acceleration, and applying Newton's Second Law, <math>F = ma</math>. This gives an accurate value for mass, limited only by the accuracy of the measurements. When astronauts need to be measured in the weightlessness of free fall, they actually find their inertial mass in a special chair called a body mass measurement device (BMMD).\n\nAt high speeds, and especially near the speed of light (<math>c=2.99792458 \\cdot 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}</math>), inertial mass can be determined by measuring the magnetic field strength and the curvature of the path of an electrically-charged mass such as an electron.\n\nNo physical difference has been found between gravitational and inertial mass in a given inertial frame. In experimental measurements, the two always agree within the margin of error for the experiment. [[Einstein]] used the fact that gravitational and inertial mass were equal to begin his [[general theory of relativity]], in which he postulated that gravitational mass was the same as inertial mass, and that the acceleration of gravity is a result of a \"valley\" or slope in the [[space-time continuum]] that masses \"fell down\". [[Dennis Sciama]] later showed that the reaction force produced by the combined gravity of all matter in the universe upon an accelerating object is mathematically equal to the object's inertia,<ref>[http://physics.fullerton.edu/~jimw/general/inertia/index.htm The Origin of Inertia]</ref> but this would only be a workable physical explanation if, by some mechanism, the gravitational effects operated instantaneously.\n\nAt any non-zero speed, relativistic mass always exceeds gravitational mass. If the mass is made to travel close to the speed of light, its \"inertial mass\" (relativistic) as observed from a stationary frame would be very great while its gravitational mass would remain at its rest value, but the gravitational effect of the extra energy would exactly balance the measured increase in inertial mass.\n\n===Inertial frames===\nIn a location such as a steadily moving railway carriage, a dropped ball (as seen by an observer in the carriage) would behave as it would if it were dropped in a stationary carriage. The ball would simply descend vertically. It is possible to ignore the motion of the carriage by defining it as an [[inertial frame]].  In a moving but non-accelerating frame, the ball behaves normally because the train and its contents continue to move at a constant velocity.  Before being dropped, the ball was traveling with the train at the same speed, and the ball's inertia ensured that it continued to move in the same speed and direction as the train, even while dropping. Note that, here, it is inertia which ensured that, not its mass.\n\nIn an [[inertial frame]], all the observers in uniform (non-accelerating) motion will observe the same laws of physics. However, observers in another inertial frame can make a simple, and intuitively obvious, transformation (the [[Galilean transformation]]), to convert their observations. Thus, an observer from outside the moving train could deduce that the dropped ball within the carriage fell vertically downwards.\n\nHowever, in reference frames which are experiencing acceleration ([[non-inertial reference frame]]s), objects appear to be affected by [[fictitious force]]s. For example, if the railway carriage were accelerating, the ball would not fall vertically within the carriage but would appear to an observer to be deflected because the carriage and the ball would not be traveling at the same speed while the ball was falling. Other examples of fictitious forces occur in rotating frames such as the earth.  For example, a missile at the North Pole could be aimed directly at a location and fired southwards.  An observer would see it apparently deflected away from its target by a force (the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]]), but in reality, the southerly target has moved because earth has rotated while the missile is in flight. Because the earth is rotating, a useful inertial frame of reference is defined by the stars, which only move imperceptibly during most observations. Newton's first law of motion is known as the principle of inertia.\n\nIn summary, the principle of inertia is intimately linked with the principles of [[conservation of energy]] and [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]].\n\n==Rotational inertia==\nAnother form of inertia is ''rotational inertia'' (\u2192 [[moment of inertia]]), the property that a rotating rigid body maintains its state of uniform [[rotation]]al motion.  Its [[angular momentum]] is unchanged, unless an external [[torque]] is applied; this is also called conservation of angular momentum.  Rotational inertia depends on the object remaining structurally intact as a rigid body, and also has practical consequences. For example, a [[gyroscope]] uses the property that it resists any change in the axis of rotation.\n\nA gas or liquid in a container will also resist changes in rotational rate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Flywheel energy storage]] devices which may also be known as an ''Inertia battery''\n*[[General relativity]]\n*[[Horizontal and vertical]]\n*[[Inertial guidance system]]\n*[[Inertial response]] of synchronous generators in an electrical grid\n*[[Kinetic energy]]\n*[[List of moments of inertia]]\n*[[Mach's principle]]\n*[[Newton's laws of motion]]\n*[[Newtonian physics]]\n*[[Special relativity]]\n*[[Steiner theorem]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book\n |last=Ragep\n |first=F.

Hoshino was producing their original Artist models from 1974, introducing a set-neck model in 1975. In 1977, they upgraded and extended their Artist range and introduced a number of other top-quality original designs made to match or surpass famous American brands: the Performer and short-lived Concert ranges which competed with the Les Paul; through-neck Musicians; Studios in fixed- and through-neck construction; the radically shaped Iceman; and the Roadster which morphed into the Roadstar range, precursor to the popular [[superstrat]] era in the mid-1980s. The newer Ibanez models began incorporating more modern elements into their design such as radical body shapes, slimmer necks, 2-octave fingerboards, slim pointed headstocks, higher-output electronics, humbucker/single-coil/humbucker (H/S/H) pickup configurations, locking tremolo bridges and different finishes.\n\n==Guitars==\n===Sub-brands===\n;Ibanez J. Custom\n:The J. Custom series are the most exclusive and high-end custom shop guitars Ibanez offers. They are \"Envisioned to be the finest Japanese-made guitar in history\". Built by some of the most skilled luthiers Ibanez has to offer, they \"represent every advance in design and technology Ibanez has developed over the last 20 years\". They feature aftermarket pickups (Seymour Duncan Jazz & Custom 5 in the 6 string model and DiMarzio PAF-7 pickups in the 7 string model,) 5 piece maple/wenge necks with Titanium reinforcement rods, a rosewood fingerboard with a tree of life fret board inlay, and Edge Zero tremolo systems.\n\n;Ibanez Prestige\n:The Prestige guitars are Ibanez's top of the line models that are built in Japan. They feature higher quality materials, high craftsmanship, and higher quality bridges compared to other models.\n\n;Ibanez Premium\n:The Premium guitars are similar to other models but are built in Ibanez's Indonesian premium factory to premium quality standards.\n\n;[[Ibanez Gio]]\n:The Ibanez Gio are Ibanez' budget guitars, designed for high playability at low costs.

At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together.

For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollak |first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684\u20131814 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore MD |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=0-8018-7204-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tann |first=Jennifer |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=May 2007 |chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728\u20131809)}}</ref> and [[Charles La Trobe]]. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to \"raise up seed to him\" (per {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5\u20136|HE}}).  Some societies have long practiced [[sororal polygyny]], a form of [[polygamy]] in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).\n\nIn Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.\n\n==Inbreeding==\n{{Main|Inbreeding}}\nOffspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders<ref>{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F.

Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>\n* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.\n* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a \"healthier\" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).\nThe closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding.

Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sweden]] is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo].

So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.</blockquote>\n\nIncestuous relationships are considered so severe among [[Chillul Hashem|''chillulim HaShem'']], acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0320.htm Leviticus 20].\n\nIn the 4th century BCE, the [[Soferim]] (''scribes'') declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah.

Arjuna had gone into exile alone after having disturbed [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Draupadi]] in their private quarters. It was during the last part of his exile, while staying at the Dvaraka residence of his cousins, that he fell in love with Subhadra. While eating at the home of [[Balarama]], Arjuna was struck with Subhadra's beauty and decided he would obtain her as his wife. Subhadra and Arjuna's son was the tragic hero [[Abhimanyu]]. According to Andhra Pradesh oral tradition, Abhimanyu himself married his first cross cousin Shashirekha, the daughter of Subhadra's brother [[Balarama]]. Cross-cousin marriages are evident from Arjuna's marriage with Subhadra, [[Pradyumna]]'s (Eldest son of Krishna) marriage with Rukmi's (brother of [[Rukmini]]) daughter.

However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then.

In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\">{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}</ref>\n\nCotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>\n\n====Trade and textiles====\nThe [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution.]]\n\n====Pre-mechanized European textile production====\nBy 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.

It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|821\u201322}}\n\n[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].\n[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]\nIn 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.<ref>R. Ray Gehani (1998). \"Management of Technology and Operations\". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998</ref>  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}</ref> It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about \u00a36 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,<ref>{{cite book|author= David S.

The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|825\u201327}}\n\nThe [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|827\u201330}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.\n\n[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]\n\n[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|832}}\n\n[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|Interior of Marshall's [[Temple Works]]]]\n\nRealising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.<ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill & Co.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}</ref>\n\nThe demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.<ref name=\"Roe1916\">{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power \u2013 first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.<ref>G. E. Mingay (1986). \"The Transformation of Britain, 1830\u20131939\". p. 25. Routledge, 1986</ref>\n\nAlthough mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>\n\n====Wool====\nThe earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant, but was far less than that of cotton.<ref name=\"David S.

Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

Bridge wall]]\n\n====UK iron production statistics====\nBar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.\n\nIn  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\nIn 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n====Iron process innovations====\nA major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,<ref>{{cite book\n|title= American Iron 1607\u20131900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 0-8018-6816-5 |page=156}}</ref> and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"David S.

In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|122\u2013125}} A minority of coals are coking.\n\nAnother factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>\n\nUse of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)\n\nBy 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.\n\nCoke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|123\u2013125}}\n\nSteam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.<ref>\n{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention|last1=Temple|first1= Robert\n|authorlink= |author2=Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn= |pages=65}} Based on the works of Joseph Needham</ref> The blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in 1760 and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at Carrington in 1768 that was designed by [[John Smeaton]].<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|124, 135}}  Cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture; the cylinders had to be free of holes and had to be machined smooth and straight to remove any warping.  [[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/><ref>Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder.

Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|123\u2013125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=0-521-27367-6 |page=85}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].<ref name=\"Iron bridge\"/>  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].\n\nEurope relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.<ref name=\"David S. Landes 1969\"/>{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.\n\n[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}</ref>  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.\n \nThe puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_tijGo0WWHMC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=rogers+puddling&source=bl&ots=KHZPqBlKQE&sig=8E1k_nJVIXX3HExaQzWiQ5L07qU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYqaWl5fXYAhXRtVMKHYqwD9kQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=rogers%20puddling&f=false]</ref>  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.<ref name=\"Tylecote_1992\"/>{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.<ref name=\"David S. Landes 1969\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nPuddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.\n\n[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using waste exhaust heat to preheat combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coal or two-thirds using coke;<ref>{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|ISBN= 0-521-09418-6|page=92}}</ref> however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}</ref>  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics\n |last= Rosenberg\n |first= Nathan |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press\n|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=0-521-27367-6 |page=90\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.\n\nShortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].\n\nThe supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.\n\n===Steam power===\n{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]\n\nThe development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&nbsp;hp.<ref>{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|ISBN= 0-521-09418-6|page=104}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its \"brand name\", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.\n\nThe first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\n[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]\n\nA fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20\u201325% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.\n\nBy 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton & Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nUntil about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].\n\nThe development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.\n\nSmall industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter&Bryant|1991|pp=}}</ref>\n\n===Machine tools===\n{{Main|Machine tool}}\n{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}\n[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]\n[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]\n\nPre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen \u2013 [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.\n\nThe demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.\n\nBefore the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\nThe first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\nThe [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\"/><ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\n[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/><ref name=\"McNeil1990\"/>{{rp|392\u201395}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>{{rp|31, 36}}\n\nMaudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>\n\n[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.\n\nThe impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref>\n\nIn the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.<ref name=\"faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu\">Economics 323\u20132: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF</ref>\n\n===Chemicals===\nThe large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.\n\nThe production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,<ref name=\"Clow52\"/> and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.\n\nThese two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.\n\nThe development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.\n\nAfter 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.<ref>Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20</ref> Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860\u20131914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.<ref>Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''\nthe co-evolution of firms, technology, and national institutions ''(2003) pp&nbsp;53\u201354''</ref>\n\n===Cement===\n[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).<br />[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]\nIn 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].<ref name=\"memphis\"/> Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.\n\n===Gas lighting===\n{{Main|Gas lighting}}\nAnother major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton & Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.\n\n===Glass making===\n{{Main|Glass production}}\n[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]\nA new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.\n\n===Paper machine===\n{{Main|Paper machine}}\nA machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-L\u00e9ger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.\n\nThe method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= A Nation of Steel: The Making of Modern America 1965\u20131925\n |last=Misa\n |first= Thomas J.\n|year=1995 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press\n|location= Baltimore and London\n|page=243\n|isbn= 978-0-8018-6502-2 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}\nThe [[British Agricultural Revolution]] is considered one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title= Agricultural Revolution in England: The transformation if the agrarian economy 1500\u20131850\n |last=Overton\n |first= Mark\n|year=1996 |publisher =Cambridge University Press\n|location=\n|isbn= 978-0-521-56859-3|pages=\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref>  However, per-capita food supply in Europe was stagnant or declining and did not improve in some parts of Europe until the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Pomeranz 2000\">{{Citation |last=Pomeranz |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Pomeranz |title=The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-691-09010-8}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.\n\n[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Foljambe's ''Rotherham [[plough]]'' of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.<ref>{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=122}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/18th/plough.html\n |title=The Rotherham Plow\n |date=\n |work=\n |publisher=Rotherham: The Unofficial Website\n |accessdate=\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814194740/http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/18th/plough.html\n |archivedate=14 August 2014\n |df=\n}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=18, 20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm\n |title       = The Rotherham Plow\n |date        = \n |work        = \n |publisher   = Rotherham.co.uk\n |accessdate  = \n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092217/http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm\n |archivedate = 24 September 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>  The [[threshing machine]],  invented by [[Andrew Meikle]] in 1784, displaced hand threshing with a [[flail]], a laborious job that took about one-quarter of agricultural labour.<ref name=\"Clark2007\">{{Harvnb|Clark|2007}}</ref>{{rp|286}}  It took several decades to diffuse<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=A New Economic View of American History\n |last1=Atack\n |first1=Jeremy\n|last2=Passell\n |first2= Peter\n|authorlink=\n|year=1994 |publisher =W.W.

Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas_Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].\n\nCoal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}\n{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}\n\nAt the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe\u2019s 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history\u2019s view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network.

Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on.

These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]\n\nSteam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.\n\nThe rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].\n\nOn 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].<ref>Herbert L. Sussman (2009). \"Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine\". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009</ref> The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].\n\nConstruction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.\n\n===Other developments===\nOther developments included more efficient [[water wheel]]s, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [[John Smeaton]]<ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention\n |last1= Rosen\n |first1= William\n|authorlink=\n|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press\n|location=\n|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=127\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref> the beginnings of a machine industry<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/><ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution\n |last=Musson\n|author2=Robinson\n|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press\n|location=\n|isbn= |page=477}}\n</ref> and the rediscovery of [[concrete]] (based on [[Lime mortar|hydraulic lime mortar]]) by [[John Smeaton]], which had been lost for 1300 years.<ref name=\"reintroduction\"/>\n\n==Social effects==\n{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}\n\n===Factory system===\n{{Main|Factory system}}\nPrior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.\n\nIn Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\nSome early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}</ref>  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.\n\nThe majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>\tMany workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])\n\nThe change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective\n |last1=Hunt\n |first1= E.

Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that \"for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility.\"<ref name=\"Lectures on Economic Growth\"/> Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.<ref name=\"Feinstein2014\">{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625\u201358|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}</ref><ref name=\"SzreterMooney2014\">{{cite journal|author=Szreter & Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0289.00084/abstract|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730\u20131749 to 31.8% in 1810\u20131829.<ref name=\"Buer\"/>\n\nThe effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.<ref name=\"Woodward81\"/> A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.<ref name=\"Woodward81\"/> During 1813\u20131913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.<ref name=\"Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913\"/><ref name=\"econlib\"/><ref name=\"hartwell\"/>\n\n====Food and nutrition====\n{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}\nChronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45\u201350 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100\"/>\n\nFood supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].\n\nThe initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.<ref name=\"Pomeranz 2000\"/> In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].<ref name=\"David S.

Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults.

By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.<ref>Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen & Unwin, 1974).</ref>  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.\n\nConditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].\n\n====Sanitation====\nIn ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.\n\nIn 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.\n\n====Water supply====\nPre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.<ref name=\"Hunter_1985\"/>\n\n====Increase in literacy====\nThe invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.\n\n===Clothing and consumer goods===\n[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]\nConsumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.\n\nMeeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.<ref name=\"Black\"/>\n\n===Population increase===\nThe Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.\n|location= New York|isbn= 0-7131-6531-6|page=3}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.<ref name=\"statistics\"/>  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.<ref name=\"independent\"/><ref name=\"bbc\"/> Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\n===Urbanization===\nThe growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,<ref name=\"prb\"/> compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).<ref name=\"prb6\"/> Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.<ref name=\"britannica7\"/>\n\n===Impact on women and family life===\nWomen's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.<ref>Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102\u20134, 306\u20138.</ref><ref>Janet Thomas, \"Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article.\" ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534\u201349. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]</ref> Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.<ref>Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).</ref>\n\nIn a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.<ref>Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).</ref>  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the \"family wage economy\" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.<ref>Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).</ref>\n\nIdeas of thrift and hard work characterized middle class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed vibrantly in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was \"voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Labour conditions===\n\n====Social structure and working conditions====\nIn terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life \"was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}</ref> Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel \u2013 [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"industrial4\"/>\n\n====Factories and urbanisation====\n{{Main|Factory system}}\n[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England (\"[[Cottonopolis]]\"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]\n\nIndustrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed \"[[Cottonopolis]]\", and the world's first industrial city.<ref name=\"Industrial city\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester \u2013 the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}</ref> Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831.

They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331\u20132}}</ref> This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}</ref> The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.\n\nFor much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.\n\nIn other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].\n\nBy 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.\n\n====Child labour====\n{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young \"drawer\" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.<ref name=\"From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life\"/> In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]\n\nThe Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.<ref name=\"Buer\"/><ref name=\"Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation\"/> There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.<ref name=\"galbithink\"/>\n\n[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,<ref name=\"victorianweb\"/> 10\u201320% of an adult male's wage.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Children as young as four were employed.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as \"pauper apprentices\", working without wages for board and lodging.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/>\n\nReports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines<ref name=\"Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission\"/> and textile factories,<ref name=\"The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England\"/> and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.\n\nPoliticians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.<ref name=\"childslaves\"/> About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\n====Organisation of labour====\n{{See also|Trade union#History}}\nThe Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.\n\nThe main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as \"the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.\n\nWorking people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.\n\nUnions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.<ref name=\"archive5\"/>\n\nEventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n====Luddites====\n{{Main|Luddite}}\n[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]\n\nThe rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.\n\nUnrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.\n\n====Shift in production's center of gravity====\nThe traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\"/>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Share of Total World Manufacturing Output (Percentage)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers|last=Kennedy|first=Paul|publisher=Random House|year=1987|location=New York|pages=149}}</ref>\n!\n!1750\n!1800\n!1860\n!1880\n!1900\n|-\n|Europe\n|23.2\n|28.1\n|53.2\n|61.3\n|62.0\n|-\n|United States\n|0.1\n|0.8\n|7.2\n|14.7\n|23.6\n|-\n|Japan\n|3.8\n|3.5\n|2.6\n|2.4\n|2.4\n|-\n|The Rest of the World\n|73.0\n|67.7\n|36.6\n|20.9\n|11.0\n|}\n\n====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====\nCheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.<ref name=\"Roe1916\"/>{{rp|150}}\n\nThe Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.<ref>{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert\n|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0375-71396-5|pages=}}</ref>  The U.S. Civil war created a \"cotton famine\" that lead to increased production in other areas of the world, including new colonies in Africa.\n\n===Impact on environment===\n[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]\nThe origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.<ref name=\"Donora\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref> The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\n\nThe manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812\u20131820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.<ref>Leslie  Tomory, \"The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812\u20131830.\" ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29\u201354.</ref>  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.<ref>Joel A.

Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].</ref> Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.<ref>Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>\n\n==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==\n\n===Continental Europe===\nThe Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.\n\n====Belgium====\n\n[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.<ref name=\"publishing\"/>\n\nWallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word \"houille\" was coined in Wallonia),<ref name=\"language\"/> the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]], (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.<ref name=\"ugent\"/> Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: \"It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain.\"<ref name=\"philippe\"/> \"The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]].\"<ref name=\"erih\"/> Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Li\u00e8ge|Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge]] wrote also: \"The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated.\" <ref name=\"linguistiques\"/>\n\n=====Demographic effects=====\nWallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:\n\n<blockquote>The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres (...) at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] (...) Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Li\u00e8ge where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.<ref name=\"stereotypes\"/></blockquote>\n\n====France====\n{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.<ref name=\"marczewski\" /> Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice L\u00e9vy-Leboyer:\n* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789\u20131815),\n* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815\u20131860),\n* economic slowdown (1860\u20131905),\n* renewal of the growth after 1905.\n\n====Germany====\n{{main|Economic history of Germany}}\n\nBased on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.<ref name=Haber>{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}</ref>\n\nGermany's political disunity \u2013 with three dozen states \u2013 and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France<ref>Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815\u20131914'' (2000)</ref>\n\n====Sweden====\n{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the period 1790\u20131815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.\n\nDuring 1815\u20131850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuh\u00e4radsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.\n\nDuring 1850\u20131890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.\n\nDuring 1890\u20131930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}\n\nThe industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).\n\nIn 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.\n\nModern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.<ref>G.C.

The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\"/>\n\nThe United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.\n\n[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,<ref name=\"manufacturers\"/> and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.<ref name=\"publication\"/>\n\nIn 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768\u20131835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.<ref name=\"britannica8\"/> [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of \"America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.\n\n[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.\n\nA major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].  The Blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].<ref name=\"Hounshell-1984\"/>\n\nPrecision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanized the shoe industry.<ref name = \"Thomson 1989\">{{cite book\n|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States\n |last=Thomson\n |first= Ross\n|authorlink=\n|year=1989 |publisher =The University of North Carolina Press\n|location= Chapel Hill and London\n|isbn=978-0807818671}}</ref> and the watch industry. The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.\n\n==Second Industrial Revolution==\n{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[S\u00e4chsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]\n<!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.-->    \n[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a \"Second Industrial Revolution\", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities.

The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.\n\nBy the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]\nThe causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].<ref name=\"The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England\"/> The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.<ref name=\"msn\"/>   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.\n\nThe presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.<ref name=\"google11\"/> Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia till 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.\n\nGovernments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.<ref name=\"industrialisation\"/> Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.<ref name=\"dklevine\"/><ref name=\"mott-smith\"/>\n\n===Causes in Europe===\n{{Main|Great Divergence}}\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 017 - The Coal Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Coal Exchange (London)|London Coal Exchange]], c. 1808.<br />European 17th century colonial expansion, international trade, and creation of financial markets produced a new legal and financial environment, one which supported and enabled 18th century industrial growth.]]\nOne question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40\u201344}}</ref>), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]<ref name=\"j-bradford-delong\"/> or the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"historyguide\"/> A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}</ref> Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context.

Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.<ref name=\"Black\"/> These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.<ref name=\"Kiely\">Kiely, Ray (November 2011). \"Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis\". UGL Press Limited: 25\u201326.</ref>\n\nThe debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Was slavery the engine of economic growth?

Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]<ref name=\"manufacturing\"/>). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position \u2013 an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.\n\n[[File:Thornhillvanda.jpg|thumb|left|''William and Mary Presenting the Cap of Liberty to Europe'', 1716, Sir [[James Thornhill]].

It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.\n\nThe stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.<ref name=\"dictatorship\"/> (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)\n\nThe French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. \"Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind.

Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750\u20131800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.\n\nIn 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank.

Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]\nKnowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.\n\nAnother means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, \"They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution\".<ref name=\"archive\"/> Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.\n\nThere were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802\u20131819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.\n\nPeriodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.\n\n====Protestant work ethic====\n{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}\nAnother theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.<ref name=\"Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation\"/> The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.\n\n[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences \u2013 areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.\n\nHistorians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.\n\n==Opposition from Romanticism==\n{{Main|Romanticism}}\nDuring the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.<ref>Michael L\u00f6wy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).</ref>  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of \"nature\" in art and language, in contrast to \"monstrous\" machines and factories; the \"Dark satanic mills\" of Blake's poem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\".

Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{Cite journal\n |last        = Ashton\n |first       = Thomas S.\n |authorlink  = T. S.

It settles legal disputes between member [[Sovereign state|states]] and gives advisory opinions to authorized UN organs and specialized agencies. It comprises a panel of 15 judges elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] for nine-year terms. It is seated in the [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/court|website=www.icj-cij.org|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague, Netherlands, seat of the ICJ]]\nEstablished in 1945 by the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], the court began work in 1946 as the successor to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. The [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]], similar to that of its predecessor, is the main constitutional document constituting and regulating the court.<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&p2=2&p3=0 Statute of the International Court of Justice]. Retrieved 31 August 2007.</ref>\n\nThe court's workload covers a wide range of judicial activity. After the court ruled that the [[United States]]'s covert war against [[Nicaragua]] was in violation of international law (''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''), the United States withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's jurisdiction only on a case-by-case basis.<ref>Churchill, Ward. ''A Little Matter of Genocide''. San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1997. Print.</ref> [[Chapter XIV of the United Nations Charter]] authorizes the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] to enforce Court rulings. However, such enforcement is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members of the Council, which the United States used in the ''Nicaragua'' case.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/PV.2718 United Nations Security Council, ''Provisional Verbatim Record of the Two Thousand Seven Hundred and Eighteenth Meeting'', p.51]</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Main article|Judges of the International Court of Justice}}\n[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|Public hearing at the ICJ.]]\nThe ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to nine-year terms by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] from a list of people nominated by the national groups in the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. The election process is set out in Articles 4\u201319 of the ICJ statute. Elections are staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court. Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special election to complete the term.\n\nNo two judges may be nationals of the same country. According to Article 9, the membership of the court is supposed to represent the \"main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world\". Essentially, that has meant [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[socialist law]] (now post-communist law).\n\nThere is an informal understanding that the seats will be distributed [[United Nations Regional Groups|by geographic regions]] so that there are five seats for Western countries, three for [[Africa|African states]] (including one judge of [[francophone]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], one of Anglophone [[common law]] and one [[Arab]]), two for [[Eastern Europe]]an states, three for Asian states and two for [[Latin America]]n and [[Caribbean]] states.<ref>Harris, D. ''Cases and Materials on International Law, 7th ed.'' (2012, London) p. 839.</ref> For most of the court's history, the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] ([[France]], [[Russia]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) have always had a judge serving, thereby occupying three of the Western seats, one of the Asian seats and one of the Eastern European seats. Exceptions have been China not having a judge on the court from 1967 to 1985, during which time it did not put forward a candidate, and British judge Sir Christopher Greenwood being withdrawn as a candidate for election for a second nine-year term on the bench in 2017, leaving no judges from the United Kingdom on the court.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\">{{cite news|title=International Court of Justice: UK abandons bid for seat on UN bench|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42061028|accessdate=21 November 2017|agency=BBC}}</ref> Greenwood had been supported by the UN Security Council but failed to get a majority in the UN General Assembly.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" /> Indian judge Dalveer Bhandari instead took the seat.<ref name=\"bbcgreenwood\" />\n\nArticle 6 of the Statute provides that all judges should be \"elected regardless of their nationality among persons of high moral character\" who are either qualified for the highest judicial office in their home states or known as lawyers with sufficient competence in international law. Judicial independence is dealt with specifically in Articles 16\u201318. Judges of the ICJ are not able to hold any other post or act as [[counsel]]. In practice, members of the court have their own interpretation of these rules and allow them to be involved in outside arbitration and hold professional posts as long as there is no conflict of interest. A judge can be dismissed only by a [[unanimity|unanimous]] vote of the other members of the court.<ref>ICJ Statute, Article 18(1)</ref> Despite these provisions, the independence of ICJ judges has been questioned. For example, during the ''Nicaragua'' case, the United States issued a communiqu\u00e9 suggesting that it could not present sensitive material to the court because of the presence of judges from [[Eastern bloc]] states.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua'' (Nicaragua v USA), [1986] ICJ Reports 14, 158\u201360 (Merits) per Judge Lachs.</ref>\n\nJudges may deliver joint judgments or give their own separate opinions. Decisions and [[Advisory Opinion]]s are by majority, and, in the event of an equal division, the President's vote becomes decisive, which occurred  in the ''Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict'' (Opinion requested by WHO), [1996] ICJ Reports 66. Judges may also deliver separate dissenting opinions.\n\n===''Ad hoc'' judges===\nArticle 31 of the statute sets out a procedure whereby ''[[ad hoc]]'' judges sit on contentious cases before the court. The system allows any party to a contentious case (if it otherwise does not have one of that party's nationals sitting on the court) to select one additional person to sit as a judge on that case only. It is thus possible that as many as seventeen judges may sit on one case.\n\nThe system may seem strange when compared with domestic court processes, but its purpose is to encourage states to submit cases. For example, if a state knows that it will have a judicial officer who can participate in deliberation and offer other judges local knowledge and an understanding of the state's perspective, it may be more willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Although this system does not sit well with the judicial nature of the body, it is usually of little practical consequence. ''Ad hoc'' judges usually (but not always) vote in favour of the state that appointed them and thus cancel each other out.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Posner, E. A., and De Figueiredo, M. F.

Articles 26\u201329 of the statute allow the court to form smaller chambers, usually 3 or 5 judges, to hear cases. Two types of chambers are contemplated by Article 26: firstly, chambers for special categories of cases, and second, the formation of ''ad hoc'' chambers to hear particular disputes. In 1993, a special chamber was established, under Article 26(1) of the ICJ statute, to deal specifically with [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] matters (although it has never been used).\n\n''Ad hoc'' chambers are more frequently convened.

However, being a party to the statute does not automatically give the court jurisdiction over disputes involving those parties. The issue of [[jurisdiction]] is considered in the three types of ICJ cases: contentious issues, incidental jurisdiction, and advisory opinions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dispute Settlement|last=J. G. Merrills|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521153393|location=New York|pages=116-134}}</ref>\n\n===Contentious issues===\n[[File:Eerste na-oorlogse zitting van het Internationaal Hof van Justititie Weeknummer 48-09 - Open Beelden - 30541.ogv|thumb|First gathering after Second World War, Dutch newsreel from 1946]]\nIn contentious cases (adversarial proceedings seeking to settle a dispute), the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the ruling of the court. Only [[Sovereign state|states]] may be parties in contentious cases. [[Individual]]s, corporations, parts of a [[federal state]], NGOs, UN organs and [[self-determination]] groups are excluded from direct participation in cases although the court may receive information from public [[international organization]]s. That does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if a state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in cases of \"diplomatic protection\", bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.<ref>See the ''Nottebohm Case'' (Liechtenstein v Guatemala), [1955] ICJ Reports 4.</ref>\n\nJurisdiction is often a crucial question for the court in contentious cases. (See [[International Court of Justice#Procedure|Procedure]] below.) The key principle is that the ICJ has jurisdiction only on the basis of consent. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the court's jurisdiction may be founded:\n* First, 36(1) provides that parties may refer cases to the court (jurisdiction founded on \"special agreement\" or \"''compromis''\"). This method is based on explicit consent rather than true compulsory jurisdiction. It is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the court's jurisdiction because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the court and are thus more likely to comply with the court's judgment.\n* Second, 36(1) also gives the court jurisdiction over \"matters specifically provided for... in treaties and conventions in force\". Most modern [[treaty|treaties]] contain a compromissory clause, providing for dispute resolution by the ICJ.<ref>See [[List of treaties that confer jurisdiction on the ICJ]].</ref> Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. For example, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Iran refused to participate in a case brought by the US based on a compromissory clause contained in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and did not comply with the judgment.<ref>''Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran'' (USA v Iran), [1979] ICJ Reports 7.</ref> Since the 1970s, the use of such clauses has declined. Many modern treaties set out their own dispute resolution regime, often based on forms of [[arbitration]].<ref>See Charney J \"Compromissory Clauses and the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\" (1987) 81 ''American Journal of International Law'' 855.</ref>\n* Third, Article 36(2) allows states to make optional clause declarations accepting the court's jurisdiction. The label \"compulsory\" sometimes placed on Article 36(2) jurisdiction is misleading since declarations by states are voluntary. Furthermore, many declarations contain reservations, such as exclusion from jurisdiction certain types of disputes (\"''ratione materia''\").<ref>See Alexandrov S ''Reservations in Unilateral Declarations Accepting the Compulsory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice'' (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff, 1995).</ref> The principle of [[reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] may further limit jurisdiction. As of February 2011, sixty-six states had a declaration in force.<ref>For a complete list of countries and their stance with the ICJ, see [http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/index.php?p1=5&p2=1&p3=3 Declarations Recognizing as Compulsory the Jurisdiction of the Court]. Retrieved 21 February 2011.</ref> Of the permanent [[Security Council]] members, only the United Kingdom has a declaration. In the court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialized countries. Since the ''[[Nicaragua v. United States|Nicaragua]]'' case, declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the court since the 1980s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Industrialized countries, however, have sometimes increased exclusions or removed their declarations in recent years. Examples include the United States, as mentioned previously, and Australia, which modified its declaration in 2002 to exclude disputes on [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] (most likely to prevent an impending challenge from East Timor, which gained their independence two months later).<ref>Burton, Bob (17 May 2005). [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GE17Ae02.html Australia, East Timor strike oil, gas deal]. ''Asia Times''. Retrieved 21 April 2006.</ref>\n* Finally, 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]'s statute. Article 37 of the Statute similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ.\n* In addition, the court may have jurisdiction on the basis of tacit consent (''[[forum prorogatum]]''). In the absence of clear jurisdiction under Article 36, jurisdiction is established if the respondent accepts ICJ jurisdiction explicitly or simply pleads [[on the merits]]. The notion arose in the [[Corfu Channel Case]] (UK v Albania) (1949), in which the court held that a letter from Albania stating that it submitted to the jurisdiction of the ICJ was sufficient to grant the court jurisdiction.\n\n=== Incidental jurisdiction ===\nUntil rendering a final judgment, the court has competence to order interim measures for the protection of the rights of a party to a dispute. One or both parties to a dispute may apply the ICJ for issuing interim measures.       In the ''Frontier Dispute'' Case, both parties to the dispute, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] submitted an application to the court to indicate interim measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/69/9961.pdf|title=Provisional measures are indicated in the case of the Frontier Dispute|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Incidental jurisdiction of the court derives from the Article 41 of the Statute of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute|title=Statute of the Court {{!}} International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref> Such as the final judgment, the order for interim measures of the court are binding on state parties to the dispute. The ICJ has competence to indicate interim measures only if the ''[[prima facie]]'' jurisdiction is satisfied.      \n\n===Advisory opinions===\n[[File:Grand Hall de Justice de Palais de La Paix \u00e0 La Haye Pays-Bas.jpg|thumb|Audience of the \"Accordance with International Law of the [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo\"]] An [[advisory opinion]] is a function of the court open only to specified United Nations bodies and agencies. The UN Charter grants the General Assembly or the Security Council a power to request the court to issue an advisory opinion on any legal question. Other organs of the UN rather than GA and SC may not request an  advisory opinion of the ICJ unless the General Assembly authorizes them. Other organs of the UN only request an advisory opinion of the court regarding the matters falling into the scope of their activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-xiv/index.html|title=Chapter XIV|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref> On receiving a request, the court decides which states and organizations might provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or oral statements. Advisory opinions were intended as a means by which UN agencies could seek the court's help in deciding complex legal issues that might fall under their respective mandates.\n\nIn principle, the court's advisory opinions are only consultative in character but they are influential and widely respected. Certain instruments or regulations can provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be specifically binding on particular agencies or states, but inherently, they are non-binding under the Statute of the Court. This non-binding character does not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal reasoning embodied in them reflects the court's authoritative views on important issues of international law. In arriving at them, the court follows essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states.\n\nAn advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/8/issue/27/un-general-assembly-requests-world-court-advisory-opinion-israels |title=The UN General Assembly Requests a World Court Advisory Opinion On Israel's Separation Barrier |author=Pieter H.F. Bekker |date=12 December 2003 |publisher=American Society of International Law |accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAdvisory opinions have often been controversial because the questions asked are controversial or the case was pursued as an indirect way of bringing what is really a contentious case before the court. Examples of advisory opinions can be found in the section [[List of International Court of Justice cases#Advisory opinions|advisory opinions]] in the [[List of International Court of Justice cases]] article. One such well-known advisory opinion is the ''[[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapons Case]]''.\n\n===ICJ and the Security Council===\nArticle 94 establishes the duty of all UN members to comply with decisions of the court involving them. If parties do not comply, the issue may be taken before the Security Council for enforcement action. There are obvious problems with such a method of enforcement. If the judgment is against one of the permanent five members of the Security Council or its allies, any resolution on enforcement would then be vetoed. That occurred, for example, after the [[Nicaragua v. United States|''Nicaragua'' case]], when Nicaragua brought the issue of the United States' noncompliance with the court's decision before the Security Council.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Furthermore, if the Security Council refuses to enforce a judgment against any other state, there is no method of forcing the state to comply. Furthermore, the most effective form to take action for the Security Council, coercive action under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], can be justified only if [[International Peace and Security|international peace and security]] are at stake. The Security Council has never done that so far.\n\nThe relationship between the ICJ and the [[Security Council]], and the separation of their powers, was considered by the court in 1992 in the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|''Pan Am'' case]]. The court had to consider an application from Libya for the order of provisional measures to protect its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the United Kingdom and United States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorized by the Security Council, which resulted in a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the court. The court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the [[Montreal Convention]], could not be ''[[prima facie]]'' regarded as appropriate since the action was ordered by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations. Nevertheless, the court declared the application admissible in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=173&code=lus&p1=3&p2=3&p3=6&case=89&k=82 |title=''Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America), Preliminary Objections, International Court of Justice, 27 February 1998'' |publisher=Icj-cij.org |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> A decision on the merits has not been given since the parties (United Kingdom, United States, and Libya) settled the case out of court in 2003.\n\nThere was a marked reluctance on the part of a majority of the court to become involved in a dispute in such a way as to bring it potentially into conflict with the Council. The court stated in the ''Nicaragua'' case that there is no necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and adjudication by the ICJ. However, when there is room for conflict, the balance appears to be in favour of the Security Council.\n\nShould either party fail \"to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court\", the Security Council may be called upon to \"make recommendations or decide upon measures\" if the Security Council deems such actions necessary. In practice, the court's powers have been limited by the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the court's ruling and by the Security Council's unwillingness to impose consequences. However, in theory, \"so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the Court is binding, final and without appeal\", and \"by signing the Charter, a State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party.\"\n\nFor example, the United States had previously accepted the court's compulsory jurisdiction upon its creation in 1946 but in 1984, after ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'', withdrew its acceptance following the court's judgment that called on the US to \"cease and to refrain\" from the \"unlawful use of force\" against the government of Nicaragua. The court ruled (with only the American judge dissenting) that the United States was \"in breach of its obligation under the Treaty of Friendship with Nicaragua not to use force against Nicaragua\" and ordered the United States to pay [[war reparation]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Examples of contentious cases====\n{{Main article|List of International Court of Justice cases}}\n\n* A complaint by the United States in 1980 that Iran was detaining American diplomats in [[Tehran]] in violation of international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/64/6291.pdf|title=Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders|date=24 May 1980|publisher=International Court of Justice}}</ref>\n* A dispute between Tunisia and Libya over the [[delimitation]] of the continental shelf between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/71/6527.pdf|title=Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of 24 February 1982 in the Case Concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)|date=10 December 1985|publisher=International Court of Justice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111085227/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/71/6527.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* A complaint by Iran after the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the [[United States Navy]] guided missile cruiser.<ref>\"[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=9c&case=79&code=irus&p3=0 Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

[[s:Statute of the International Court of Justice#Article 59|Article 59]] makes clear that the [[common law]] notion of [[precedent]] or ''[[stare decisis]]'' does not apply to the decisions of the ICJ. The court's decision binds only the parties to that particular controversy. Under 38(1)(d), however, the court may consider its own previous decisions.\n\nIf the parties agree, they may also grant the court the liberty to decide ''[[ex aequo et bono]]'' (\"in justice and fairness\"),<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(2)</ref> granting the ICJ the freedom to make an equitable decision based on what is fair under the circumstances. That provision has not been used in the court's history. So far, the International Court of Justice has dealt with about 130 cases.\n\n==Procedure==\nThe ICJ is vested with the power to make its own rules. Court procedure is set out in the ''Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978'' (as amended on 29 September 2005).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nCases before the ICJ will follow a standard pattern. The case is lodged by the applicant, which files a written memorial setting out the basis of the court's jurisdiction and the merits of its claim. The respondent may accept the court's jurisdiction and file its own memorial on the merits of the case.\n\n===Preliminary objections===\nA respondent that does not wish to submit to the jurisdiction of the court may raise preliminary objections. Any such objections must be ruled upon before the court can address the merits of the applicant's claim. Often, a separate public hearing is held on the preliminary objections and the court will render a judgment. Respondents normally file preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the court and/or the admissibility of the case. Inadmissibility refers to a range of arguments about factors the court should take into account in deciding jurisdiction, such as the fact that the issue is not justiciable or that it is not a \"legal dispute\".\n\nIn addition, objections may be made because all necessary parties are not before the court. If the case necessarily requires the court to rule on the rights and obligations of a state that has not consented to the court's jurisdiction, the court does not proceed to issue a judgment on the merits.\n\nIf the court decides it has jurisdiction and the case is admissible, the respondent then is required to file a Memorial addressing the merits of the applicant's claim. Once all written arguments are filed, the court holds a public hearing on the merits.\n\nOnce a case has been filed, any party (usually the applicant) may seek an order from the court to protect the ''status quo'' pending the hearing of the case. Such orders are known as Provisional (or Interim) Measures and are analogous to interlocutory [[injunction]]s in [[United States law]]. Article 41 of the statute allows the court to make such orders. The court must be satisfied to have ''[[prima facie]]'' jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case before it grants provisional measures.\n\n===Applications to intervene===\nIn cases in which a third state's interests are affected, that state may be permitted to intervene in the case and participate as a full party. Under Article 62, a state \"with an interest of a legal nature\" may apply; however, it is within the court's discretion whether or not to allow the intervention. Intervention applications are rare, and the first successful application occurred only in 1991.\n\n===Judgment and remedies===\nOnce deliberation has taken place, the court issues a majority opinion. Individual judges may issue concurring opinions (if they agree with the outcome reached in the judgment of the court but differ in their reasoning) or dissenting opinions (if they disagree with the majority). No appeal is possible, but any party may ask for the court to clarify if there is a dispute as to the meaning or scope of the court's judgment.<ref>Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 60</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{refimprove|section|date=January 2015}}\nThe International Court has been criticized with respect to its rulings, its procedures, and its authority. As with [[criticisms of the United Nations]], many of these criticisms refer more to the general authority assigned to the body by member states through its charter than to specific problems with the composition of judges or their rulings. Major criticisms include the following:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ogbodo|first1=S.

According to the sovereignty principle of international law, no nation is superior or inferior against another. Therefore, there is no entity that could force the states into practice of the law or punish the states in case any violation of international law occurs. Therefore, the absence of binding force means that the {{UNnum}} member states of the ICJ do not necessarily have to accept the jurisdiction. Moreover, membership in the UN and ICJ does not give the court automatic jurisdiction over the member states, but it is the consent of each state to follow the jurisdiction that matters.\n* Organizations, private enterprises, and individuals cannot have their cases taken to the International Court or appeal a national supreme court's ruling. UN agencies likewise cannot bring up a case except in advisory opinions (a process initiated by the court and non-binding). Only states can bring the cases and become the defendants of the cases. This also means that the potential victims of crimes against humanity, such as minor ethnic groups or indigenous peoples, may not have appropriate backing by a state.\n* Other existing international thematic courts, such as the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], are not under the umbrella of the International Court. Unlike ICJ, international thematic courts like ICC work independently from United Nations. Such dualistic structure between various international courts sometimes makes it hard for the courts to engage in effective and collective jurisdiction.\n* The International Court does not enjoy a full [[separation of powers]], with permanent members of the Security Council being able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they consented to be bound.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871831,00.html |title=\"World Court: Completing the Circle\" ''Time'', 28 November 1960 |work=Time |date=28 November 1960 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Because the jurisdiction does not have binding force itself, in many cases, the instances of aggression are adjudicated by Security Council by adopting a resolution, etc. There is, therefore, a likelihood for the permanent member states of Security Council to avoid the legal responsibility brought up by International Court of Justice, as shown in the example of ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Nations|Law}}\n* [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]]\n* [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]\n* [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]]\n* [[List of International Court of Justice cases]]\n* [[List of treaties that confer jurisdiction on the International Court of Justice]]\n* [[Supranational aspects of international organizations]]\n* [[Universal jurisdiction]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dunne, Michael. \"Isolationism of a Kind: Two Generations of World Court Historiography in the United States,\" ''Journal of American Studies'' (1987) 21#3 pp 327\u2013351.\n* Rosenne S., \"Rosenne's the world court: what it is and how it works'' 6th ed (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff, 2003).\n* Kwiatkowska, Barbara, [http://www.brill.com/decisions-world-court-relevant-un-convention-law-sea \"Decisions of the World Court Relevant to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea\"].

The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007.

M. Yaglom's ''Correlation Theory...'', published by [[Springer Verlag]], has two ISBNs, 0-387-96331-6 and 3-540-96331-6. Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit: 6. Springer uses 431 as their publisher code for Japanese (4) and 4-431-96331-? would also have check digit ? = 6.  Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also get check digit ? = 6. This suggests special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would ''not'' lead the same item number to get the same check digit every time. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect amounts to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.</ref>\n# the ''registrant'' element,\n# the ''publication element'',<ref name=\"ISBN User Man\" /> and\n# a ''[[checksum]] character'' or [[check digit]].<ref name=\"ISBN User Man\" />\n\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (''prefix element'', ''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit''), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with [[hyphen]]s or spaces. Separating the parts (''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit'') of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.<ref>The International ISBN agency's ''ISBN User's Manual'' says: \"The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces\" although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed; see [https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation ISBN hyphenation definition]. The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages.</ref>\n\n=== How ISBNs are issued ===\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active.

In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nA listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form ([[Euro|\u20ac]]1399, [[United States dollar|US$]]1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.<ref>See [http://www.isbn-international.org/page/directory Publisher's International ISBN Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921085436/http://isbn-international.org/page/directory |date=21 September 2013 }}</ref> Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: [[List of group-0 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 0]] and [[List of group-1 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 1]].\n\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\n\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer|last=Splane|first=Lily|publisher=Anaphase II Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-0-945962-14-4|location=|pages=37|quote=|via=}}</ref> Here are some sample <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> codes, illustrating block length variations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:40em;\"\n|-\n!

It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten-digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with \"0\" will give the same check-digit as without \u2013 the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen-digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an \"X\".\n\n=== ISBN-10 check digits ===\nThe 2001 edition of the official manual of the [http://www.isbn-international.org/ International ISBN Agency] says that the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> [[check digit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |title=ISBN Users' Manual \u2013 4. Structure of ISBN |publisher=Isbn.org |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522043458/http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013 }}</ref> \u2013 which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN \u2013 must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of [[11 (number)|11]].\n\nFor example, for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-2:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n s &= (0\\times 10) + (3\\times 9) + (0\\times 8) + (6\\times 7) + (4\\times 6) + (0\\times 5) + (6\\times 4) + (1\\times 3) + (5\\times 2) + (2\\times 1) \\\\\n   &=    0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 + 2\\\\\n   &= 132 = 12\\times 11\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFormally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:\n:<math>(10x_1+9x_2+8x_3+7x_4+6x_5+5x_6+4x_7+3x_8+2x_9+x_{10})\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}.</math>\n\nIt is also true for <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ''ascending'' order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n s &= (0\\times 1) + (3\\times 2) + (0\\times 3) + (6\\times 4) + (4\\times 5) + (0\\times 6) + (6\\times 7) + (1\\times 8) + (5\\times 9) + (2\\times 10) \\\\\n   &=    0 + 6 +   0 +  24 +  20 +   0 + 42  +   8 + 45 + 20\\\\\n   &= 165 = 15\\times 11\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFormally, we can say:\n:<math>(x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4 + 5x_5 + 6x_6 + 7x_7 + 8x_8 + 9x_9 + 10x_{10})\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}.</math>\n\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be [[mathematical proof|proved]] that all possible valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a [[prime number]].)\nThe ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN&nbsp;\u2013 the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.<ref>For example, ''I'saka: a sketch grammar of a language of north-central New Guinea.'' Pacific Linguistics. ISBN \"0-85883-554-4\".</ref>\n\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\n=== ISBN-10 check digit calculation ===\n<!-- \"Damm algorithm\" links here -->\nEach of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN\u2014excluding the check digit itself\u2014is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, the check digit for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n s &= (0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2)\\\\\n   &= 130\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) &minus; this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 0-306-40615-2</nowiki>. The value <math>x_{10}</math> required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.\n\nAlternatively, [[modular arithmetic]] is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The [[remainder]] of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 \u2013 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the ''first'' \"modulo 11\" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\n\nFor example, the check digit for the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n s &= (11 - ( ((0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2) ) \\,\\bmod\\, 11 ) \\,\\bmod\\, 11\\\\\n   &=    (11 - (0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 ) \\,\\bmod\\, 11) \\,\\bmod\\, 11\\\\\n   &= (11-(130 \\,\\bmod\\, 11))\\,\\bmod\\, 11 \\\\\n   &= (11-(9))\\,\\bmod\\, 11 \\\\\n   &= (2)\\,\\bmod\\, 11 \\\\\n   &= 2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\n\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding <code>t</code> into <code>s</code> computes the necessary multiples:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n// Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one.\n// digits[i] must be between 0 and 10.\nint CheckISBN(int const digits[10])\n{\n        int i, s = 0, t = 0;\n\n        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n                t += digits[i];\n                s += t;\n        }\n        return s % 11;\n}\n</source>\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case <code>s</code> could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid <nowiki>ISBN 99999-999-9-X</nowiki>), or <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\n=== ISBN-13 check digit calculation ===\nThe 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(284&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> describes how the 13-digit ISBN [[check digit]] is calculated. The <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of [[10 (number)|10]].\n\nFormally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:\n:<math>(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + x_5 + 3x_6 + x_7 + 3x_8 + x_9 + 3x_{10} + x_{11} + 3x_{12} + x_{13} ) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}.</math>\n\nThe calculation of an <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\n\nFor example, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit of 978-0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:\n<!-- This is what we'd like to do, but it is far too wide.\n:<math>\\textstyle \\begin{array}{rlllllllllllll}\ns &{}= 1 \\times 9 &{}+ 3 \\times 7 &{}+ 1 \\times 8 &{}+ 3 \\times 0 &{}+ 1 \\times 3 &{}+ 3 \\times 0 &{}+ 1 \\times 6 &{}+ 3 \\times 4 &{}+ 1 \\times 0 &{}+ 3 \\times 6 &{}+ 1 \\times 1 &{}+ 3 \\times 5 \\\\\n &{}= 9 &{}+21 &{}+ 8 &{}+ 0 &{}+ 3 &{}+ 0 &{}+ 6 &{}+ 12 &{}+ 0 &{}+ 18 &{}+ 1 &{}+ 15 \\\\\n &{}= 93\n\\end{array}</math>\n-->\n s = 9\u00d71 + 7\u00d73 + 8\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 3\u00d71 + 0\u00d73 + 6\u00d71 + 4\u00d73 + 0\u00d71 + 6\u00d73 + 1\u00d71 + 5\u00d73\n   =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15\n   = 93\n 93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3\n 10 \u2013  3 = 7\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7</nowiki>.\n\nIn general, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit is calculated as follows.\n\nLet\n:<math>r = \\big(10 - \\big(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + \\cdots + x_{11} + 3x_{12}\\big) \\,\\bmod\\, 10\\big).</math>\n\nThen\n:<math>x_{13} = \\begin{cases} r &\\text{ ; } r < 10 \\\\ 0 &\\text{ ; } r = 10 . \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThis check system&nbsp;\u2013 similar to the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] check digit formula&nbsp;\u2013 does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3\u00d76+1\u00d71 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3\u00d71+1\u00d76 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> formula uses the [[prime number|prime]] modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.\n\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\n=== ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion ===\nThe conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix \"978\" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> algorithm.\n\n=== {{anchor|Cancelled ISBN}}Errors in usage ===\nPublishers and [[library|libraries]] have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Book Publishing I|last=Lorimer|first=Rowland|last2=Shoichet|first2=Jillian|last3=Maxwell|first3=John W.|publisher=CCSP Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9738727-0-5|location=|pages=299|quote=|via=}}</ref> For example, {{ISBN|0-590-76484-5}} is shared by two books \u2013 ''Ninja gaiden\u00ae: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo'' (1990) and ''Wacky laws'' (1997), both published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]].\n\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\".<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd020.html 020 \u2013 International Standard Book Number (R) \u2013 MARC 21 Bibliographic \u2013 Full].

If a book exists in one or more digital ([[e-book]]) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate [[EPUB]], [[Amazon Kindle]], and [[PDF]] formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sellbox.com/myth-eisbn-every-ebook-edition-needs-unique-number/|title=The Myth of the eISBN Why Every eBook Edition Needs a Unique Number \u2013 Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|date=2013-06-28|newspaper=Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n\n== EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading ==\nCurrently the [[barcode]]s on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market [[paperback]] book's front cover) are [[European Article Number|EAN-13]]; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an [[EAN-5]] for the [[currency]] and the [[recommended retail price]].<ref>{{Citation |title= Frequently asked questions |publisher= ISBN |place= [[U.S.|US]] |date= 12 March 2014 |url= http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211950/http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |archivedate= 16 April 2014 |df= dmy-all }} \u2014 including a detailed description of the EAN-13 format.</ref> For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the [[Bookland]] \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).\n\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (<nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki>). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007.<ref>{{Citation |publisher= Collections |contribution-url= http://www.collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm |type= FAQ |title= ISO TC49SC9 |contribution= ISBN |place= [[Canada|CA]]}}</ref> {{as of|2011}}, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the [[Bookland|Musicland]] code for [[Sheet music|musical scores]] with an [[ISMN]]. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\n\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the [[Global Trade Item Number]] (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.<ref>{{Citation | title = Standards | contribution-url = http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/transition.asp | contribution = Are You Ready for <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki>? | publisher = ISBN}}</ref>\n\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to [[information technology]] systems. Hence, many [[bookstore|booksellers]] (e.g., [[Barnes & Noble]]) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] [[barcode system]] to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> in North America.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN]] (Amazon Standard Identification Number)\n* [[CODEN]] (serial publication identifier currently used by libraries; replaced by the ISSN for new works)\n* [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] (Digital Object Identifier)\n* [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] (English Short Title Catalogue)\n* [[ETTN]] (Electronic Textbook Track Number)\n* [[International Standard Audiovisual Number|ISAN]] (International Standard Audiovisual Number)\n* [[International Standard Music Number|ISMN]] (International Standard Music Number)\n* [[International Standard Musical Work Code|ISWC]] (International Standard Musical Work Code)\n* [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]] (International Standard Recording Code)\n* [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] (International Standard Serial Number)\n* [[International Standard Text Code|ISTC]] (International Standard Text Code)\n* [[ISWN]] (International Standard Wine Number)\n* [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] (Library of Congress Control Number)\n* [[List of group-0 ISBN publisher codes]]\n* [[List of group-1 ISBN publisher codes]]\n* [[OCLC]] number (Online Computer Library Center number<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xisbn.worldcat.org/xisbnadmin/xoclcnum/index.htm|title=xISBN (Web service)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Xisbn.worldcat.org|accessdate=2013-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501074452/http://xisbn.worldcat.org/xisbnadmin/xoclcnum/index.htm|archive-date=1 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>)\n* [[Registration authority]]\n* [[Book Item and Component Identifier|BICI]] (Book Item and Component Identifier)\n* [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier|SICI]] (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier)\n* [[VD 16]] (Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16.

The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in [[CIDR notation]] by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., {{IPaddr|192.168.1.15|24}}, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}.\n\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and by five [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]], such as [[Internet service providers]]. IPv4 addresses have been distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8&nbsp;million addresses each. Each ISP or private network administrator assigns an IP address to each device connected to its network. Such assignments may be on a ''static'' (fixed or permanent) or ''dynamic'' basis, depending on its software and practices.\n\n==Function==\nAn IP address serves two principal functions. It [[Identification (information)|identifies]] the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"<ref name=rfc791/>\nThe [[Header (computing)|header]] of each [[Network packet|IP packet]] contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the destination host.\n\n==IP versions==\nTwo [[Internet Protocol#Version history|versions of the Internet Protocol]] are in common use in the Internet today. The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the Internet, is [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nThe rapid [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhaustion of IPv4 address space]] available for assignment to [[Internet service providers]] and end user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883/><ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc8200/>\nIPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s, when commercial production deployment commenced.\n\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently.  Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term ''IP address'' typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]] in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\n==IPv4 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv4#Addressing}}\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv4 address from [[dot-decimal notation]] to its binary value.]]\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast address]]ing (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in [[dot-decimal notation]], consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., {{IPaddr|172.16.254.1}}.  Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an [[Octet (computing)|octet]]) of the address. In some cases of technical writing,{{specify|date=May 2018}} IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[binary numeral system|binary]] representations.\n\n===Subnetting===\nIP address are divided into two parts: the ''network number'' portion in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier'' used for host numbering within a network.<ref name=rfc760 /> \n\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [[classful network]] architecture.<ref name=rfc791/>\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained [[subnetwork]] design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the ''class'' of the address. Three classes (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') were defined for universal [[unicast]] addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (''B'' and ''C''). The following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS TABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS WRONG.

The class system of the address space was replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n===Private addresses===\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as [[private network]]s developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with [[network address translation]] (NAT), when needed.\n\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.<ref name=rfc1918>{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|6761}}.</ref> These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into [[subnetwork|subnets]]; for example, many [[residential gateway|home routers]] automatically use a default address range of {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|192.168.0.255}} ({{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|24}}).\n{{trim|{{#section:IPv4|IPv4-private-networks}}}}\n\n==IPv6 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n[[Image:Ipv6 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv6 address from [[hexadecimal]] representation to its binary value.]]\n\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (approximately {{val|3.403|e=38}}) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of [[routing table]]s in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2<sup>64</sup> hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some [[networking hardware]].<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Private addresses===\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as [[unique local address]]es (ULA). The routing prefix {{IPaddr|fc00::|7}} is reserved for this block,<ref name=rfc4193>{{Cite IETF|rfc=4193|title=Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses|author1=R. Hinden|author2=B. Haberman|date=October 2005|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref> which is divided into two {{IPaddr||8}} blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit pseudorandom number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose ({{IPaddr|fec0::}}), dubbed site-local addresses.<ref name=rfc3513>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3513|title=Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture|author1=R. Hinden|autorlink2=[[Steve Deering]]|author2=S. Deering|date=April 2003|publisher=Network Working Group}} Obsoleted by {{IETF RFC|4291}}.</ref> However, the definition of what constituted ''sites'' remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.<ref name=rfc3879>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3879|title=Deprecating Site Local Addresses|author1=C. Huitema|author2=B. Carpenter|date=September 2004|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref>\n\nAddresses starting with fe80:, called [[Link-local address|link-local]] addresses, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 host on a link. This feature is required in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\nPrivate address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n==IP subnetworks==\nIP networks may be divided into [[subnetwork]]s in both [[IPv4 subnetting reference|IPv4]] and [[IPv6 subnetting reference|IPv6]]. For this purpose, an IP address is logically recognized as consisting of two parts: the ''network prefix'' and the ''host identifier'', or ''interface identifier'' (IPv6). The [[subnetwork#Binary subnet masks|subnet mask]] or the CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term ''subnet mask'' is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the ''routing prefix''. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1}} and {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}, respectively. The [[CIDR notation]] for the same IP address and subnet is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1|24}}, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n==IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}}== <!-- redirect target from [[Dynamic IP]] and [[Static IP]] -->\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically at the time of booting, or permanently by fixed configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a ''static IP address''. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned newly each time it restarts, this is known as using a ''dynamic IP address''.\n\nThe configuration of a static IP address depends in detail on the software or hardware installed in the computer. Computers used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing, Static addresses are also sometimes convenient for locating servers inside an enterprise.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned using methods such as [[Zeroconf]] for self-configuration, or by the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP) from a network server. The address assigned with DHCP usually has an expiration period, after which the address may be assigned to another device, or to the originally associated host if it is still powered up. A network administrator may implement a DHCP method so that the same host always receives a specific address.\n\nDHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems. DHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]].\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or stateful (DHCP) address configurations, an operating system may assign an IP address to a network interface using stateless auto-configuration methods, such as Zeroconf.\n\n===Sticky dynamic IP address {{anchor|Sticky dynamic IP address}}===\n<!-- redirect target from [[Sticky dynamic IP address]] and [[Sticky IP]] -->\nA ''sticky dynamic IP address'' is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.\n\n===Address autoconfiguration=== \nAddress block {{IPaddr|169.254.0.0|16}} is defined for the special use in [[link-local address]]ing for IPv4 networks.<ref name=rfc6890>{{Cite IETF|rfc=6890|bcp=153|title=Special-Purpose IP Address Registries|author1=M.

Haberman|date=April 2013|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|8190}}.</ref>\nIn IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a local-link address automatically in the block {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}.<ref name=rfc6890 />\n\nThese addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, that a host is connected to. These addresses are not routable and like private addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [[Microsoft]] created an implementation that is called Automatic Private IP Addressing ([[APIPA]]). APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and has, thus, become a [[de facto standard]] in the industry.\nMany years later, in May 2005, the [[IETF]] defined a formal standard for it.<ref name=rfc3927>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3927|title=Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses|author1=S.

A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.  Many modern [[operating system]]s notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4198 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224215139/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archivedate = 24 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: January 7, 2009\"</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4199 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |accessdate  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[:en:Microsoft|Microsoft]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222151743/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archivedate = 22 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: 7 January 2009\"</ref> If one of the devices is the gateway, the network will be crippled.

It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Some individual PCs have several distinct unicast addresses, each for its own distinct purpose. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n===Broadcast addressing===\n[[Broadcasting (computing)|Broadcasting]] is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to send data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation, while all receivers capture the network packet (''all-hosts broadcast''). The address {{IPaddr|255.255.255.255}} is used for network broadcast. In addition, a directed (limited) broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network {{IPaddr|192.0.2.0|24}} is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.255}}.\n\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing, and replaces it with multicast to the specially-defined all-nodes multicast address.\n\n===Multicast addressing===\nA [[multicast address]] is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|239.255.255.255}} (the former [[Classful network|Class D]] addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.<ref name=rfc5771>{{Cite IETF|rfc=5771|bcp=51|title=IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=D. Meyer|date=March 2010|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix {{IPaddr|ff00::|8}} for multicast applications. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group.\n\n===Anycast addressing===\nLike broadcast and multicast, [[anycast]] is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is logically closest in the network. Anycast address is an inherent feature of only IPv6.  In IPv4, anycast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest-path metric of [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP routing]] and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] systems.\n\n==Geolocation==\nA host may use [[geolocation software]] to deduce the [[geolocation]] of its communicating peer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipinfo.io/|title=IP Information|accessdate=2013-04-11|date=2013-04-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704024032/http://ipinfo.io/|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/netacuity-edge-offers-hyper-local-ip-targeting|title=NetAcuity Edge Offers Hyper-local IP targeting|accessdate=2011-12-10|date=2009-07-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205000152/http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/netacuity-edge-offers-hyper-local-ip-targeting|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{visible anchor|Public address}}==\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [[private network]]s, such as those reserved by {{IETF RFC|1918}}, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for [[link-local address]]ing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n==Firewalling==\nFor security and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by [[IP address blocking]] or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers. This is achieved with [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]] software running on the networks gateway router.  A database of IP addresses of permissible traffic may be maintained in [[blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] or [[whitelist]]s.\n\n==Address translation==\nMultiple client devices can appear to {{anchor|shared_IP}}share an IP address, either because they are part of a [[shared hosting]] [[web server]] environment or because an IPv4 [[network address translator]] (NAT) or [[proxy server]] acts as an [[intermediary]] agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address might be masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask a large number of devices in a [[private network]]. Only the \"outside\" interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last        = Comer\n |first       = Douglas\n |title       = Internetworking with TCP/IP:Principles, Protocols, and Architectures \u2013 4th ed.\n |publisher   = Prentice Hall\n |year        = 2000\n |location    = Upper Saddle River, NJ\n |url         = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |isbn        = 0-13-018380-6\n |page        = 394\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232359/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |archivedate = 13 April 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nCommonly, the NAT device maps TCP or UDP port numbers on the side of the larger, public network to individual private addresses on the masqueraded network.\n\nIn residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [[residential gateway]].

It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English \"if and only if\", with its pre-existing meaning.\n\nIn writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to P \"if and only if\" Q include: ''Q is [[Necessary and sufficient conditions#Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient]] for P'', ''P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q'' (compare [[material conditional|material implication]]), ''P precisely if Q'', ''P precisely (or exactly) when Q'', ''P exactly in case Q'', and ''P just in case Q''.<ref>Weisstein, Eric W. \"Iff.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Iff.html</ref> Some authors regard \"iff\" as unsuitable in formal writing;<ref>E.g. {{citation |title=Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics |series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] |first1=Ulrich |last1=Daepp |first2=Pamela |last2=Gorkin|author2-link=Pamela Gorkin |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=9781441994790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QKcaXrVZb0C&pg=PA52 |page=52 |quote=While it can be a real time-saver, we don't recommend it in formal writing.}}</ref> others use it freely.<ref>{{citation |title=Engineering Writing by Design: Creating Formal Documents of Lasting Value |first1=Edward J. |last1=Rothwell |first2=Michael J. |last2=Cloud |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781482234312 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muXMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 |quote=It is common in mathematical writing}}</ref>\n\nIn [[formula (mathematical logic)|logical formulae]], logical symbols are used instead of these phrases; see the discussion of notation.\n\n==Definition==\nThe [[truth table]] of ''P'' <math>\\Leftrightarrow</math> ''Q'' is as follows:<ref>[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=p+%3C%3D%3E+q p <=> q].

These are usually treated as equivalent. However, some texts of [[mathematical logic]] (particularly those on [[first-order logic]], rather than [[propositional logic]]) make a distinction between these, in which the first, \u2194, is used as a symbol in logic formulas, while \u21d4 is used in reasoning about those logic formulas (e.g., in [[metalogic]]). In [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz|\u0141ukasiewicz]]'s notation, it is the prefix symbol 'E'.\n\nAnother term for this [[logical connective]] is [[exclusive nor]].\n\nIn [[TeX]] \"if and only if\" is shown as a long double arrow: <math>\\iff</math> via command \\iff.\n\n===Proofs===\nIn most [[logical system]]s, one [[Proof theory|proves]] a statement of the form \"P iff Q\" by proving \"if P, then Q\" and \"if Q, then P\".  Proving this pair of statements sometimes leads to a more natural proof since there are not obvious conditions in which one would infer a biconditional directly. An alternative is to prove the [[disjunction]] \"(P and Q) or (not-P and not-Q)\", which itself can be inferred directly from either of its disjuncts\u2014that is, because \"iff\" is [[truth-function]]al, \"P iff Q\" follows if P and Q have both been shown true, or both false.\n\n===Origin of iff and pronunciation===\nUsage of the abbreviation \"iff\" first appeared in print in [[John L. Kelley]]'s 1955 book ''General Topology''.<ref>''General Topology,'' reissue {{ISBN|978-0-387-90125-1}}</ref>\nIts invention is often credited to [[Paul Halmos]], who wrote \"I invented 'iff,' for  'if and only if'\u2014but I could never believe I was really its first inventor.\"<ref name=\"Higham1998\">{{cite book |author=Nicholas J. Higham |title=Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQd2fJA7Y4C&pg=PA24 |year=1998 |publisher=SIAM |isbn=978-0-89871-420-3 |page=24 |edition=2nd}}</ref>  \n\nIt is somewhat unclear how \"iff\" was meant to be pronounced. In current practice, the single 'word' \"iff\" is almost always read as the four words \"if and only if\". However, in the preface of ''General Topology'', Kelley suggests that it should be read differently: \"In some cases where mathematical content requires 'if and only if' and [[euphony]] demands something less I use Halmos' 'iff'\". The authors of one discrete mathematics textbook suggest:<ref>{{cite book |title=Discrete Algorithmic Mathematics |last=Maurer |first=Stephen B. |last2=Ralston |first2=Anthony |publisher=CRC Press |year=2005 |isbn=1568811667 |edition=3rd |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |pages=60}}</ref> \"Should you need to pronounce iff, really [[Consonant gemination|hang on to the 'ff']] so that people hear the difference from 'if'\", implying that \"iff\" could be pronounced as {{IPA|[\u026af\u02d0]}}.\n\n=== Usage in definitions ===\nTechnically, definitions are always \"if and only if\" statements; many texts such as Kelley's ''General Topology'' follow the strict demands of logic, and use \"if and only if\" or ''iff'' in definitions of new terms (for instance, from ''General Topology'', p. 25: \"A set is '''countable''' iff it is finite or countably infinite\" [boldface in original]). However, this usage of \"if and only if\" is not universal; often, mathematical definitions follow the special convention that \"if\" is interpreted to mean \"if and only if\" (for example, one might say, \"A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover\").<ref>{{citation |page=71 |first=Steven G. |last=Krantz |title=A Primer of Mathematical Writing |year=1996 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-0-8218-0635-7}}</ref>\n\n==Distinction from \"if\" and \"only if\"==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n# '''\"Madison will eat the fruit <u>if</u> it is an apple.\"''' (equivalent to '''\"<u>Only if</u> Madison will eat the fruit, it is an apple;\"''' or '''\"Madison will eat the fruit ''\u2190'' fruit is an apple\"''')\n#: This states that Madison will eat fruits that are apples. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison might also eat bananas or other types of fruit. All that is known for certain is that she will eat any and all apples that she happens upon. That the fruit is an apple is a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.\n# '''\"Madison will eat the fruit <u>only if</u> it is an apple.\"''' (equivalent to '''\"<u>If</u> Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple\"''' or '''\"Madison will eat the fruit ''\u2192'' fruit is an apple\"''')\n#: This states that the only fruit Madison will eat is an apple. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that Madison will refuse an apple if it is made available, in contrast with (1), which requires Madison to eat any available apple. In this case, that a given fruit is an apple is a ''necessary'' condition for Madison to be eating it. It is not a sufficient condition since Madison might not eat all the apples she is given.\n# '''\"Madison will eat the fruit <u>if and only if</u> it is an apple\"''' (equivalent to '''\"Madison will eat the fruit ''\u2194'' fruit is an apple\"''')\n#: This statement makes it clear that Madison will eat all and only those fruits that are apples. She will not leave any apple uneaten, and she will not eat any other type of fruit. That a given fruit is an apple is both a ''necessary'' and a ''sufficient'' condition for Madison to eat the fruit.\n\nSufficiency is the converse of necessity. That is to say, given ''P''\u2192''Q'' (i.e. if ''P'' then ''Q''), ''P'' would be a sufficient condition for ''Q'', and ''Q'' would be a necessary condition for ''P''. Also, given ''P''\u2192''Q'', it is true that ''\u00acQ''\u2192''\u00acP'' (where \u00ac is the negation operator, i.e. \"not\"). This means that the relationship between ''P'' and ''Q'', established by ''P''\u2192''Q'', can be expressed in the following, all equivalent, ways:\n:''P'' is sufficient for ''Q''\n:''Q'' is necessary for ''P''\n:''\u00acQ'' is sufficient for ''\u00acP''\n:''\u00acP'' is necessary for ''\u00acQ''\nAs an example, take (1), above, which states ''P''\u2192''Q'', where ''P'' is \"the fruit in question is an apple\" and ''Q'' is \"Madison will eat the fruit in question\". The following are four equivalent ways of expressing this very relationship:\n:If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it.\n:Only if Madison will eat the fruit in question, is it an apple.\n:If Madison will not eat the fruit in question, then it is not an apple.\n:Only if the fruit in question is not an apple, will Madison not eat it.\nSo we see that (2), above, can be restated in the form of ''if...then'' as \"If Madison will eat the fruit in question, then it is an apple\"; taking this in conjunction with (1), we find that (3) can be stated as \"If the fruit in question is an apple, then Madison will eat it; ''and'' if Madison will eat the fruit, then it is an apple\".\n\n==In terms of Euler diagrams==\n<gallery widths=\"270\">\nFile:Example of A is a proper subset of B.svg|A is a proper subset of B. A number is in A only if it is in B; a number is in B if it is in A.\nFile:Example of C is no proper subset of B.svg|C is a subset but not a proper subset of B. A number is in B if and only if it is in C, and a number is in C if and only if it is in B.\n</gallery>\n\n[[Euler diagram]]s show logical relationships among events, properties, and so forth. \"P only if Q\", \"if P then Q\", and  \"P\u2192Q\" all mean that P is a [[subset]], either proper or improper, of Q. \"P if Q\", \"if Q then P\", and Q\u2192P all mean that Q is a proper or improper subset of P. \"P if and only if Q\" and \"Q if and only if P\" both mean that the sets P and Q are identical to each other.\n\n==More general usage==\nIff is used outside the field of logic. Wherever logic is applied, especially in [[mathematics|mathematical]] discussions, it has the same meaning as above: it is an abbreviation for ''if and only if'', indicating that one statement is both [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for the other. This is an example of [[mathematical jargon]]. (However, as noted above, ''if'', rather than ''iff'', is more often used in statements of definition.)\n\nThe elements of ''X'' are ''all and only'' the elements of ''Y'' is used to mean: \"for any ''z'' in the [[domain of discourse]], ''z'' is in ''X'' if and only if ''z'' is in ''Y''.\"\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Thinking}}\n* [[Covariance]]\n* [[Logical biconditional]]\n* [[Logical equality]]\n* [[Necessary and sufficient condition]]\n* [[Polysyllogism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/Iff.html |title= Tables of truth for if and only if |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000505112920/http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Logic/Iff.html |archive-date= May 5, 2000 |deadurl= }}\n* [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003470.html Language Log: \"Just in Case\"]\n* [http://hesperusphosphorus.wordpress.com/2009/12/08/just-in-case Southern California Philosophy for philosophy graduate students: \"Just in Case\"]\n\n[[Category:Logical connectives]]\n[[Category:Mathematical terminology]]\n[[Category:Necessity and sufficiency]]", "sha1": "lwtbmyevjkp4ein88g167kqoux9wa1b"}}, {"title": "IP", "ns": "0", "id": "14923", "revision": {"id": "858300433", "parentid": "844507616", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T06:24:16Z", "contributor": {"ip": "14.207.34.128"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''IP''' may refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Businesses and organizations==\n* IP College or Indraprastha College for Women, a constituent college of the University of Delhi, New Delhi, India\n* [[Imperial Police]], a former Indian police agency\n* [[International Paper]], an American pulp and paper company\n* [[Iraqi Police]]\n* [[Atyrau Airways]] (IATA code IP)\n* [[Workers' Initiative]] or ''Inicjatywa Pracownicza'', a Polish trade union\n\n==Places==\n* [[IP postcode area]] for Ipswich and surrounding areas\n* [[Ip, S\u0103laj]], Romania\n* [[IP Casino Resort & Spa]], in Biloxi, Mississippi, US\n\n==Science and technology==\n===Biology and medicine===\n* [[Immunoprecipitation]], a molecular biology technique\n* [[Incontinentia pigmenti]], a genetic disorder\n* [[Indian Pharmacopoeia]], a set of drug standards\n* [[Infundibulopelvic ligament]], part of the female pelvis\n* [[Interphalangeal joint (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Interventional pulmonology]], a less invasive lung treatment than surgery\n* [[Intestinal permeability]]\n* [[Intraperitoneal injection]]\n* [[Prostacyclin receptor]], symbol PTGIR, older synonym IP\n\n===Computing===\n* [[Internet Protocol]], a set of rules for sending data across a network\n* [[IP address]], a computer's address under the Internet Protocol\n* [[IP (complexity)]], a class in computational complexity theory\n* [[IP core]] (Intellectual Property core), a reusable design unit owned by one party\n* [[Instruction pointer]], a processor register\n* Intelligent Peripheral, a part of a public telecommunications [[Intelligent Network#SS7 architecture|Intelligent Network]]\n* [[Image processing]]\n\n===Other uses in science and technology===\n* [[IP Code]], or Ingress Protection Rating, an equipment protection classification scheme\n* [[Identified patient]], a psychology term\n* [[Identity preserved]], an agricultural designation\n* [[Induced polarization]], a geophysical imaging technique\n* [[Ion plating]], a chemical process\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[Ip (surname)]]\n* [[Industrial policy]], country's official strategic effort to encourage the development of certain sectors of the economy\n* [[Inflectional phrase]], a functional phrase that has inflectional properties\n* [[Innings pitched]], a baseball statistic\n* [[Insolvency practitioner]], a legal specialist\n* [[Integrated Programme]], an academic scheme\n* [[Integrated project (EU)]], a type of research project\n* [[Intellectual property]], creations of the mind for which exclusive legal rights are recognized\n* ''[[Internationale Politik]]'', a German political journal\n* Item and Process, a linguistic method to describe phenomena of [[allomorphy]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Independence Party (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Independent Party (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "n4q9r6qwwlmn8kgplkhujt9792tw6d6"}}, {"title": "List of Italian dishes", "ns": "0", "id": "14926", "revision": {"id": "865830133", "parentid": "865829285", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T13:02:42Z", "contributor": {"ip": "5.90.26.99"}, "comment": "/* Rice dishes */The name of the food isn't correct.

He graduated with a BA. from [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], on 1624. He obtained the curacy of [[St Edmund\u2019s Church, Castleton]], Derbyshire, in 1627. He was one of king's four preachers in Lancashire in 1631. He was twice imprisoned by commissioners of array. He worked for establishment of Presbyterianism; successively at Leeds, Preston, and Garstang, whence he was ejected for nonconformity in 1662. He also published religious works.\n\n==Biography==\nAmbrose was born in 1604. He was the son of Richard Ambrose, vicar of [[Ormskirk]], and was probably descended from the Ambroses of [[Lowick, Cumbria|Lowick]] in [[Furness]], a well-known [[Roman Catholic]] family. He entered [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], in 1621, in his seventeenth year.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHaving graduated B.A. in 1624 and been ordained, Ambroses received in 1627 the little cure of [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] in [[Derbyshire]].  By the influence of [[William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford|William Russell, earl of Bedford]], he was appointed one of the king's itinerant preachers in [[Lancashire]], and after living for a time in [[Garstang]], he was selected by the Lady Margaret Hoghton as vicar of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].  He associated himself with [[Presbyterianism]], and was on the celebrated committee for the ejection of \"scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters\" during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSo long as Ambrose continued at Preston he was favoured with the warm friendship of the Hoghton family, their ancestral woods and the tower near [[Blackburn]] affording him sequestered places for those devout meditations and \"experiences\" that give such a charm to his [[diary]], portions of which are quoted in his ''Prima Media'' and ''Ultima'' (1650, 1659).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The immense auditory of his sermon (''Redeeming the Time'') at the funeral of Lady Hoghton was long a living tradition all over the county. On account of the feeling engendered by the civil war Ambrose left his great church of Preston in 1654, and became minister of Garstang, whence, however, in 1662 he was ejected along two thousand ministers who refused to conform (see [[Great Ejection]]). His after years were passed among old friends and in quiet meditation at Preston. He died of [[apoplexy]] about 20 January 1664.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Character assessment==\nAs a religious writer Ambrose has a vividness and freshness of imagination possessed by scarcely any of the [[Puritan]] Nonconformists. Many who have no love for Puritan doctrine, nor sympathy with Puritan experience, have appreciated the [[pathos]] and beauty of his writings, and his ''Looking unto Jesus'' long held its own in popular appreciation with the writings of [[John Bunyan]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDr [[Edmund Calamy the Elder]] (1600\u20131666) wrote about him:\n{{quote|Ambrose was a man of that substantial worth, that eminent piety, and that exemplary life, both as a minister and a christian, that it is to be lamented the world should not have the benefit of particular memoirs of him.{{sfn|Bailey|1885|p=350}}}}\n\nIn the opinion of John Eglington Bailey (his biographer in the [[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]]), his character has been misrepresented by Wood. He was of a peaceful disposition; and though he put his name to the fierce \"Harmonious Consent\", he was not naturally a partisan. He evaded the political controversies of the time.

Iwcoffice.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2013.</ref> and took effect on 10 November 1948. Its protocol (which represented the first substantial revision of the convention and extended the definition of a \"[[whale catcher|whale-catcher]]\" to include helicopters as well as ships) was signed in Washington on 19 November 1956. The convention is a successor to the '''International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling''', signed in London on 8 June 1937, and the protocols for that agreement signed in London on 24 June 1938, and 26 November 1945.\n\nThe objectives of the agreement are the protection of all whale species from [[overhunting]], the establishment of a system of international regulation for the whale fisheries to ensure proper conservation and development of whale stocks, and safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by whale stocks. The primary instrument for the realization of these aims is the [[International Whaling Commission]] which was established pursuant to this convention. The commission has made many revisions to the schedule that makes up the bulk of the convention. The Commission process has also reserved for governments the right to carry out scientific research which involves killing of whales.\n\nThere have been consistent disagreement over the scope of the convention. According to the IWC:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe 1946 Convention does not define a 'whale', although a list of names in a number of languages was annexed to the Final Act of the Convention. Some Governments take the view that the IWC has the legal competence to regulate catches of only these named great whales (the baleen whales and the sperm whale). Others believe that all cetaceans, including the smaller dolphins and porpoises, also fall within IWC jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/cetacea|title=Cetacea|author=International Whaling Commission|date=|work=iwcoffice.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727052230/http://iwcoffice.org/cetacea |archivedate=27 July 2012|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/cetacea|title=Cetacea|author=|date=|work=iwc.int}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Signatories and membership==\nAs of January 2014, membership consists of 89 states of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/members|title=Membership|author=International Whaling Commission|date=|work=iwc.int}}</ref> The initial signatory states were [[Argentina]], Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], France, the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], South Africa, the [[Soviet Union]], the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nAlthough Norway is a party to the convention, it maintains an objection to paragraph 10(e) of the convention (the section referring to the 1986 moratorium).

The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis.

''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and may under some circumstances be left off the title of a published work.\n\n'''Technical reports'''\n: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.<br/>For example:\n* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management\n* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation \u2014 Metadata for construction documentation\n\n'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''\n: Technical specifications may be produced when \"the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard\". A publicly available specification is usually \"an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.<br/>For example:\n* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation \u2014 Reference designation system \u2014 Part 1: General application rules\n* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles \u2014 Roof load carriers\n\n'''Technical corrigenda'''\n: ISO also sometimes issues \"technical corrigenda\" (where \"corrigenda\" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/>\n\n'''ISO guides'''\nThese are meta-standards covering \"matters related to international standardization\".<ref name=\"ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004\"/> They are named using the format ''\"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title\"''.<br/>For example:\n* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities \u2014 General vocabulary\n* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification\n\n===Document copyright===\nISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards.

ISO/IEC directives allow also the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] \u2013 ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe CD becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). The text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nThe fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* Many [[CD image]]s end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence CD&nbsp;images are commonly referred to as \"ISOs\". Virtually all computers with [[CD-ROM]] drives that can read CDs use this standard. Some DVD-ROMs also use ISO&nbsp;9660 file systems.\n* Photographic film's sensitivity to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the film's speed is often referred to by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras is often called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n* [[ISO 11783]], which is marketed as ISOBUS.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\"/> ISO standards are normally not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as too expensive for small [[open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=''The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community'' |date=1 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting 'standardization by corporation'.<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |deadurl=no |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nComputer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] investor, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process,\" and Shuttleworth alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML.\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering [[Good ol' boy|old boys club]] and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion \u2026 then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism.

To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples. [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;25] These illustrate the kinds of relationships that maximise an individual's self-enjoyment, pleasure, freedom, and individuality, as well as ensuring that those involved sacrifice nothing while belonging to them. Such associations are based on mutuality and a free and spontaneous co-operation between equals. As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p.&nbsp;218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n:\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others. That would be a man bereft of innumerable pleasures, a wretched character&nbsp;... would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist?&nbsp;...

At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs\" and so \"[i]ndividualist anarchism is clearly a form of [[artisan]]al [[socialism]] [...] while [[communist anarchism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]] are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism\".<ref>[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG1#secg14 \"G.1.4 Why is the social context important in evaluating Individualist Anarchism?\"] in ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''</ref> Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that \"[u]nlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests.

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism [...] is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11</ref> Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\".<ref>Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.</ref> Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.<ref>Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''Voluntary Socialism'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 & 22.<br />Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek & Oppenheimer).</ref> Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not labouring.

However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession\").<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee.

Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon that \"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost\".<ref name=\"Tucker state\"/>\n\n=== Max Stirner ===\n{{main|Max Stirner}}\n[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Max Stirner]] by [[Friedrich Engels]]]]\nJohann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 \u2013 June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the ''[[nom de plume]]'' he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in [[German language|German]] 'Stirn'), was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], who ranks as one of the literary fathers of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]], especially of individualist anarchism.

Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract\". He also said after converting to Egoist individualism that \"[i]n times past [...] it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off [...] Man's only right to land is his might over it\".<ref>Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350</ref> In adopting Stirnerite egoism in 1886, Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&layout=html#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.

Born into a secular family, Eva was a [[pacifist]] educated in the \"religion of civic duty and science\".<ref>Calvino, \"Political Autobiography of a Young Man\", ''Hermit in Paris'', 132.</ref> Eva gave Calvino his unusual first name to remind him of his Italian heritage, although since he wound up growing up in Italy after all, Calvino thought his name sounded \"belligerently nationalist\". <ref>Calvino, ''Hermit in Paris'', pp. 14.</ref> Calvino described his parents as being \"very different in personality from one another\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> suggesting perhaps deeper tensions behind a comfortable, albeit strict, [[middle-class]] upbringing devoid of conflict. As an adolescent, he found it hard relating to [[poverty]] and the [[working-class]], and was \"ill at ease\" with his parents' openness to the laborers who filed into his father's study on Saturdays to receive their weekly paycheck.<ref>Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 135.</ref>\n\n===Early life and education===\nIn 1925, less than two years after Calvino's birth, the family returned to Italy and settled permanently in [[Sanremo]] on the [[Liguria]]n coast. Calvino's brother Floriano, who became a distinguished geologist, was born in 1927.\n\nThe family divided their time between the Villa Meridiana, an experimental floriculture station which also served as their home, and Mario's ancestral land at San Giovanni Battista. On this small working farm set in the hills behind Sanremo, Mario pioneered in the cultivation of then exotic fruits such as [[avocado]] and [[grapefruit]], eventually obtaining an entry in the ''Dizionario biografico degli italiani'' for his achievements. The vast forests and luxuriant fauna omnipresent in Calvino's early fiction such as ''[[The Baron in the Trees]]'' derives from this \"legacy\". In an interview, Calvino stated that \"San Remo continues to pop out in my books, in the most diverse pieces of writing.\"<ref>Corti, ''Autografo 2'' (October 1985): 51.</ref> He and Floriano would climb the tree-rich estate and perch for hours on the branches reading their favorite adventure stories.<ref>Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 2.</ref> Less salubrious aspects of this \"paternal legacy\" are described in ''[[The Road to San Giovanni]]'', Calvino's memoir of his father in which he exposes their inability to communicate: \"Talking to each other was difficult. Both verbose by nature, possessed of an ocean of words, in each other's presence we became mute, would walk in silence side by side along the road to San Giovanni.\"<ref>Calvino, ''The Road to San Giovanni'', 10.</ref> A fan of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as a child, Calvino felt that his early interest in stories made him the \"black sheep\" of a family that held literature in less esteem than the sciences. Fascinated by American movies and cartoons, he was equally attracted to drawing, poetry, and theatre. On a darker note, Calvino recalled that his earliest memory was of a [[Marxist]] professor who had been brutally assaulted by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Blackshirts]]:  \"I remember clearly that we were at dinner when the old professor came in with his face beaten up and bleeding, his bowtie all torn, asking for help.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 130.</ref>\n\nOther legacies include the parents' beliefs in [[Freemasonry]], [[Republicanism]] with elements of [[Anarchism]] and [[Marxism]].<ref>McLaughlin, xii. Calvino defined his family's traditions as \"a humanitarian Socialism, and before that Mazzinianism\". Cf. Calvino, 'Behind the Success' in ''Hermit in Paris'', 223.</ref> Austere freethinkers with an intense hatred of the ruling [[National Fascist Party]], Eva and Mario also refused to give their sons any education in the Catholic Faith or any other religion.<ref>Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 3.</ref> Italo attended the English nursery school St George's College, followed by a Protestant elementary private school run by [[Waldensians]]. His secondary schooling, with a classical lyceum curriculum, was completed at the state-run Liceo Gian Domenico Cassini where, at his parents' request, he was exempted from religion classes but frequently asked to justify his anti-conformism to teachers, janitors, and fellow pupils.<ref>Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 133.</ref> In his mature years, Calvino described the experience as having made him \"tolerant of others' opinions, particularly in the field of religion, remembering how irksome it was to hear myself mocked because I did not follow the majority's beliefs\".<ref>Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 134.</ref> In 1938, [[Eugenio Scalfari]], who went on to found the weekly magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' and ''[[La Repubblica]]'', a major Italian newspaper, came from [[Civitavecchia]] to join the same class though a year younger, and they shared the same desk.<ref>Sabina Minardi,['Eugenio Scalfari: \u00abIo e Calvino nel segno di Atena\u00bb ,'] [[L'Espresso]] 15 September 2015.</ref> The two teenagers formed a lasting friendship, Calvino attributing his political awakening to their university discussions. Seated together \"on a huge flat stone in the middle of a stream near our land\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> he and Scalfari founded the MUL (University Liberal Movement).\n\nEva managed to delay her son's enrolment in the Party's armed scouts, the ''[[Balilla Moschettieri]]'', and then arranged that he be excused, as a non-Catholic, from performing devotional acts in Church.<ref>Calvino, \"Political Autobiography of a Young Man\", ''Hermit in Paris'', 134.</ref> But later on, as a compulsory member, he could not avoid the assemblies and parades of the ''[[Avanguardisti]]'',<ref>Calvino, 'The Duce's Portraits', ''Hermit in Paris'', 210.</ref> and was forced to participate in the Italian invasion of the [[French Riviera]] in June 1940.<ref>Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 3.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nIn 1941, Calvino enrolled at the [[University of Turin]], choosing the Agriculture Faculty where his father had previously taught courses in [[agronomy]]. Concealing his literary ambitions to please his family, he passed four exams in his first year while reading anti-Fascist works by [[Elio Vittorini]], [[Eugenio Montale]], [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Johan Huizinga]], and Pisacane, and works by [[Max Planck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein]] on physics.<ref>Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 140.</ref> Disdainful of Turin students, Calvino saw himself as enclosed in a \"provincial shell\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 138.</ref> that offered the illusion of immunity from the Fascist nightmare: \"We were \u2018hard guys\u2019 from the provinces, hunters, snooker-players, show-offs, proud of our lack of intellectual sophistication, contemptuous of any patriotic or military rhetoric, coarse in our speech, regulars in the brothels, dismissive of any romantic sentiment and desperately devoid of women.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nCalvino transferred to the [[University of Florence]] in 1943 and reluctantly passed three more exams in agriculture. By the end of the year, the Germans had succeeded in occupying Liguria and setting up [[Benito Mussolini]]'s puppet [[Republic of Sal\u00f2]] in northern Italy. Now twenty years old, Calvino refused military service and went into hiding. Reading intensely in a wide array of subjects, he also reasoned politically that, of all the [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] groupings, the [[Communist Party of Italy|communists]] were the best organized with \"the most convincing political line\".<ref>Calvino recalled this sudden, forced transformation of a dreamy adolescent into a partisan soldier as one bounded by logic since \"the logic of the Resistance was the very logic of our urge towards life\". Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 146.</ref>\n\nIn spring 1944, Eva encouraged her sons to enter the [[Italian Resistance]] in the name of \"natural justice and family virtues\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 142.</ref> Using the battlename of \"Santiago\", Calvino joined the ''Garibaldi Brigades'', a clandestine Communist group and, for twenty months, endured the fighting in the [[Maritime Alps]] until 1945 and the [[Victory in Europe Day|Liberation]]. As a result of his refusal to be a conscript, his parents were held hostage by the [[Nazis]] for an extended period at the Villa Meridiana. Calvino wrote of his mother's ordeal that \"she was an example of tenacity and courage\u2026 behaving with dignity and firmness before the [[SS]] and the Fascist militia, and in her long detention as a hostage, not least when the [[blackshirts]] three times pretended to shoot my father in front of her eyes. The historical events which mothers take part in acquire the greatness and invincibility of natural phenomena\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Turin and communism===\nCalvino settled in [[Turin]] in 1945, after a long hesitation over living there or in [[Milan]].<ref>The decision was influenced by the firmly anti-Fascist stance of Turin during Mussolini's years in power. Cf. Calvino, 'Behind the Success' in ''Hermit in Paris'', 225.</ref> He often humorously belittled this choice, describing Turin as a \"city that is serious but sad\". Returning to university, he abandoned Agriculture for the Arts Faculty. A year later, he was initiated into the literary world by [[Elio Vittorini]], who published his short story \"Andato al comando\" (1945; \"Gone to Headquarters\") in ''[[Il Politecnico]]'', a Turin-based weekly magazine associated with the university.<ref>''Il Politecnico'' was founded by Elio Vittorini, a novelist and the leading leftist intellectual of postwar Italy, who saw it as a means to restore Italy's diminished standing within the European cultural mainstream. Cf. Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 3.</ref> The horror of the war had not only provided the raw material for his literary ambitions but deepened his commitment to the Communist cause. Viewing civilian life as a continuation of the partisan struggle, he confirmed his membership of the [[Italian Communist Party]]. On reading [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s ''[[State and Revolution]]'', he plunged into post-war political life, associating himself chiefly with the worker's movement in Turin.<ref>Calvino, 'Political Autobiography of a Young Man', ''Hermit in Paris'', 143.</ref>\n\nIn 1947, he graduated with a Master's thesis on [[Joseph Conrad]], wrote short stories in his spare time, and landed a job in the publicity department at the Einaudi publishing house run by [[Giulio Einaudi]]. Although brief, his stint put him in regular contact with [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Norberto Bobbio]], and many other left-wing intellectuals and writers. He then left Einaudi to work as a journalist for the official Communist daily, ''[[L'Unit\u00e0]]'', and the newborn Communist political magazine, ''Rinascita''. During this period, Pavese and poet [[Alfonso Gatto]] were Calvino's closest friends and mentors.<ref>Calvino, 'Behind the Success' in ''Hermit in Paris'', 224.</ref>\n\nHis first novel, ''Il sentiero dei nidi di ragno'' (''[[The Path to the Nest of Spiders]]'') written with valuable editorial advice from Pavese, won the Premio Riccione on publication in 1947.<ref>Critic Martin McLaughlin points out that the novel failed to win the more prestigious Premio Mondadori. McLaughlin, xiii.</ref> With sales topping 5000 copies, a surprise success in postwar Italy, the novel inaugurated Calvino's [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] period. In a clairvoyant essay, Pavese praised the young writer as a \"squirrel of the pen\" who \"climbed into the trees, more for fun than fear, to observe partisan life as a fable of the forest\".<ref>Pavese's review first published in ''l'Unit\u00e0'' on 26 September 1947. Quoted in Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 39.</ref> In 1948, he interviewed one of his literary idols, [[Ernest Hemingway]], travelling with [[Natalia Ginzburg]] to his home in [[Stresa]].\n\n''Ultimo viene il corvo'' (''[[The Crow Comes Last]]''), a collection of stories based on his wartime experiences, was published to acclaim in 1949. Despite the triumph, Calvino grew increasingly worried by his inability to compose a worthy second novel. He returned to Einaudi in 1950, responsible this time for the literary volumes. He eventually became a consulting editor, a position that allowed him to hone his writing talent, discover new writers, and develop into \"a reader of texts\".<ref>Weiss, ''Understanding Italo Calvino'', 4.</ref> In late 1951, presumably to advance in the Communist Party, he spent two months in the [[Soviet Union]] as correspondent for ''l'Unit\u00e0''. While in Moscow, he learned of his father's death on 25 October. The articles and correspondence he produced from this visit were published in 1952, winning the Saint-Vincent Prize for journalism.\n\nOver a seven-year period, Calvino wrote three realist novels, ''The White Schooner'' (1947\u20131949), ''Youth in Turin'' (1950\u20131951), and ''The Queen's Necklace'' (1952\u201354), but all were deemed defective.<ref>Of the three manuscripts, only ''Youth in Turin'' was published in the review ''Officina'' in 1957.</ref> During the eighteen months it took to complete ''I giovani del Po'' (''Youth in Turin''), he made an important self-discovery: \"I began doing what came most naturally to me \u2013 that is, following the memory of the things I had loved best since boyhood. Instead of making myself write the book I ''ought'' to write, the novel that was expected of me, I conjured up the book I myself would have liked to read, the sort by an unknown writer, from another age and another country, discovered in an attic.\"<ref>Calvino, 'Introduction by the author', ''Our Ancestors'', vii.</ref> The result was ''Il visconte dimezzato'' (1952; ''[[The Cloven Viscount]]'') composed in 30 days between July and September 1951. The protagonist, a seventeenth century viscount sundered in two by a cannonball, incarnated Calvino's growing political doubts and the divisive turbulence of the [[Cold War]].<ref>Calvino, 'Introduction by the author', ''Our Ancestors'', x.</ref> Skillfully interweaving elements of the [[fable]] and the [[fantasy]] genres, the [[allegorical]] novel launched him as a modern \"[[fable|fabulist]]\".<ref>Calvino, 'Objective Biographical Notice', ''Hermit in Paris'', 163.</ref> In 1954, Giulio Einaudi commissioned his ''Fiabe Italiane'' (1956; ''[[Italian Folktales]]'') on the basis of the question, \"Is there an Italian equivalent of the [[Brothers Grimm]]?\"<ref>Calvino, 'Objective Biographical Notice', ''Hermit in Paris'', 164.</ref> For two years, Calvino collated tales found in 19th century collections across Italy then translated 200 of the finest from various dialects into Italian.  Key works he read at this time were [[Vladimir Propp]]'s ''Morphology of the Folktale'' and ''Historical Roots of Russian Fairy Tales'', stimulating his own ideas on the origin, shape and function of the story.<ref>Calvino, 'Introduction', ''Italian Folktales'', xxvii.</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Calvino wrote with [[Giorgio Bassani]] for ''[[Botteghe Oscure]]'', a magazine named after the popular name of the party's head-offices in Rome.  He also worked for ''Il Contemporaneo'', a [[marxism|Marxist]] weekly.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958 Calvino had an affair with Italian actress [[Elsa De Giorgi]], a married, older woman. Excerpts of the hundreds of love letters Calvino wrote to her were published in the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in 2004, causing some controversy.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/bin/print_ipub.php?file=/articles/2004/08/20/calvino_ed3_.php  Italian novelist's love letters turn political], ''International Herald Tribune'', 20 August 2004</ref>\n\n===After communism===\nIn 1957, disillusioned by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]], Calvino left the Italian Communist Party. In his letter of resignation published in ''[[L'Unit\u00e0]]'' on 7 August, he explained the reason of his dissent (the violent suppression of the Hungarian uprising and the revelation of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s crimes) while confirming his \"confidence in the democratic perspectives\" of world Communism.<ref>Cf. Barenghi and Bruno, \"Cronologia\" in ''Romanzi e racconti di Italo Calvino'', LXXIV; and Calvino, \"The Summer of '56\" in ''Hermit in Paris'', 200</ref> He withdrew from taking an active role in politics and never joined another party.<ref>\"For some years now I have stopped being a member of the Communist party, and I have not joined any other party.\" \"Political Autobiography of a Young Man\" in ''Hermit in Paris'', 154</ref> Ostracized by the PCI party leader [[Palmiro Togliatti]] and his supporters on publication of ''Becalmed in the Antilles'' (''La gran bonaccia delle Antille''), a satirical allegory of the party's immobilism, Calvino began writing ''[[The Baron in the Trees]]''. Completed in three months and published in 1957, the fantasy is based on the \"problem of the intellectual's political commitment at a time of shattered illusions\".<ref>Calvino, \"Introduction\" in ''Our Ancestors'', x</ref> He found new outlets for his periodic writings in the journals ''Citt\u00e0 aperta'' and ''Tempo presente'', the magazine ''Passato e presente'', and the weekly ''Italia Domani''. With Vittorini in 1959, he became co-editor of ''[[Il Menab\u00f2 di letteratura|'Il Menab\u00f2]]'', a cultural journal devoted to literature in the modern industrial age, a position he held until 1966.<ref>McLaughlin, ''Italo Calvino'', 51</ref>\n\nDespite severe restrictions in the US against foreigners holding communist views, Calvino was allowed to visit the United States, where he stayed six months from 1959 to 1960 (four of which he spent in New York), after an invitation by the [[Ford Foundation]]. Calvino was particularly impressed by the \"New World\": \"Naturally I visited the South and also California, but I always felt a New Yorker. My city is New York.\"  The letters he wrote to Einaudi describing this visit to the United States were first published as  \"American Diary 1959\u20131960\" in ''[[Hermit in Paris]]'' in 2003.\n\nIn 1962 Calvino met Argentinian translator Esther Judith Singer (\"Chichita\") and married her in 1964 in [[Havana]], during a trip in which he visited his birthplace and was introduced to [[Che Guevara|Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]]. On 15 October 1967, a few days after Guevara's death, Calvino wrote a tribute to him that was published in Cuba in 1968, and in Italy thirty years later.<ref>[http://fullmoonfever.wordpress.com/category/che-guevara/ ''The Words that Failed Me: Calvino on Che Guevara'']</ref> He and his wife settled in Rome in the via Monte Brianzo where their daughter, Giovanna, was born in 1965. Once again working for Einaudi, Calvino began publishing some of his \"[[Cosmicomics]]\" in ''Il Caff\u00e8'', a literary magazine.\n\n===Later life and work===\nVittorini's death in 1966 greatly affected Calvino.  He went through what he called an \"intellectual depression\", which the writer himself described as an important passage in his life: \"...I ceased to be young. Perhaps it's a metabolic process, something that comes with age, I'd been young for a long time, perhaps too long, suddenly I felt that I had to begin my old age, yes, old age, perhaps with the hope of prolonging it by beginning it early.\"\n\nIn the fermenting atmosphere that evolved into 1968's cultural revolution (the [[May 1968 in France|French May]]), he moved with his family to Paris in 1967, setting up home in a villa in the Square de Ch\u00e2tillon. Nicknamed ''L'ironique amus\u00e9'', he was invited by [[Raymond Queneau]] in 1968 to join the [[Oulipo]] (''Ouvroir de litt\u00e9rature potentielle'') group of experimental writers where he met [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Perec]], and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], all of whom influenced his later production.<ref>McLaughlin, ''Italo Calvino'', xv.</ref> That same year, he turned down the [[Viareggio Prize]] for ''Ti con zero'' (''Time and the Hunter'') on the grounds that it was an award given by \"institutions emptied of meaning\".<ref>Barenghi and Falcetto, 'Cronologia' in ''Romanzi e racconti di Italo Calvino'', LXXVII</ref> He accepted, however, both the Asti Prize and the Feltrinelli Prize for his writing in 1970 and 1972, respectively. In two autobiographical essays published in 1962 and 1970, Calvino described himself as \"atheist\" and his outlook as \"non-religious\".<ref>Cf. \"Political Autobiography of a Young Man\" and \"Objective Biographical Notice\" in ''Hermit in Paris'', 133, 162</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=lright|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|quote  =<poem>\nThe catalogue of forms is endless: until every shape has found its city, new cities will continue to be born.

His interests included classical studies: [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Ignatius of Loyola|Ignacio de Loyola]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. Between 1972\u20131973 Calvino published two short stories, \"The Name, the Nose\" and the [[Oulipo]]-inspired \"[[The Burning of the Abominable House]]\" in the Italian edition of ''[[Playboy]]''.  He became a regular contributor to the  Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', spending his summer vacations in a house constructed in [[Roccamare]] near [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], Tuscany.\n\nIn 1975 Calvino was made Honorary Member of the [[American Academy in Rome|American Academy]]. Awarded the [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature]] in 1976, he visited Mexico, Japan, and the United States where he gave a series of lectures in several American towns. After his mother died in 1978 at the age of 92, Calvino sold Villa Meridiana, the family home in San Remo. Two years later, he moved to Rome in Piazza Campo Marzio near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] and began editing the work of [[Tommaso Landolfi]] for Rizzoli. Awarded the French [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 1981, he also accepted to be jury president of the 29th [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\nDuring the summer of 1985, Calvino prepared a series of texts on literature for the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] to be delivered at [[Harvard University]] in the fall. On 6 September, he was admitted to the ancient hospital of [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala]] in [[Siena, Italy|Siena]] where he died during the night between 18 and 19 September of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].<ref name=bookb>{{cite web|title=Book Browse's Favorite Quotes|url=https://www.bookbrowse.com/quotes/detail/index.cfm/quote_number/98/a-classic-is-a-book-that-has-never-finished-saying-what-it-has-to-say|publisher=Book Browse|accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref> His lecture notes were published posthumously in Italian in 1988 and in English as ''[[Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]'' in 1993.\n\n== Authors he helped publish ==\n* [[Mario Rigoni Stern]]\n* [[Gianni Celati]]\n* [[Andrea De Carlo]]\n* [[Daniele Del Giudice]]\n* [[Leonardo Sciascia]]\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\nA selected bibliography of Calvino's writings follows, listing the works that have been translated into and published in English, along with a few major untranslated works.

Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs. Most modern designs support [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target.\n\nEarly ICBMs had [[circular error probable|limited precision]], which made them suitable for use only [[Countervalue|against the largest targets]], such as cities. They were seen as a \"safe\" basing option, one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack. [[Counterforce|Attacks against military targets]] (especially hardened ones) still demanded the use of a more precise, manned [[bomber]]. Second- and third-generation designs (such as the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]]) dramatically improved accuracy to the point where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked.\n\nICBMs are differentiated by having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s (IRBMs), [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s (MRBMs), [[short-range ballistic missile]]s (SRBMs) and [[tactical ballistic missile]]s (TBMs). Short and medium-range ballistic missiles are known collectively as [[theatre ballistic missile]]s.\n\n== History ==\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:R-7 (7A) misil.svg|thumb|upright|Primary views of an [[R-7 Semyorka]], the world's first ICBM and satellite launch vehicle]]\nThe development of the world's first practical design for an ICBM, [[Aggregate (rocket family)#A9/A10|A9/10]], intended for use in bombing New York and other American cities, was undertaken in [[Nazi Germany]] by the team of [[Wernher von Braun]] under ''Projekt Amerika''. The ICBM A9/A10 rocket initially was intended to be guided by radio, but was changed to be a piloted craft after the failure of [[Operation Elster]]. The second stage of the A9/A10 rocket was tested a few times in January and February 1945. The progenitor of the A9/A10 was the German [[V-2 rocket]], also designed by von Braun and widely used at the end of World War II to bomb British and Belgian cities. All of these rockets used liquid propellants. Following the war, von Braun and other leading German scientists were relocated to the United States to work directly for the US Army through [[Operation Paperclip]], developing the [[IRBM]]s, ICBMs, and [[launch vehicle|launchers]].\n\nThis technology was also predicted by US Army General [[Hap Arnold]], who wrote in 1943:\n{{Quote | Someday, not too distant, there can come streaking out of somewhere \u2013 we won't be able to hear it, it will come so fast \u2013 some kind of gadget with an explosive so powerful that one projectile will be able to wipe out completely this city of Washington.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/spacepower.html |chapter-url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/space-Ch19.html |title=Toward a Theory of Space Power |chapter=19: Increasing the Military Uses of Space |first1=Everett C. |last1=Dolman |first2=Henry F., Jr |last2=Cooper |publisher=NDU Press |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215061633/http://www.ndu.edu/press/spacepower.html |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Correll |first=John T. |url= https://www.gkpadho.com/current-affairs-20-feb-2018/ |title=World\u2019s most powerful ballistic missile |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Cold War ===\n\nIn the immediate post-war era, the US and USSR both started rocket research programs based on the German wartime designs, especially the V-2. In the US, each branch of the military started its own programs, leading to considerable duplication of effort. In the USSR, rocket research was centrally organized, although several teams worked on different designs. Early designs from both countries were short-range missiles, like the V-2, but improvements quickly followed.\n\nIn the USSR, early development was focused on missiles able to attack European targets. This changed in 1953 when [[Sergei Korolyov]] was directed to start development of a true ICBM able to deliver newly developed hydrogen bombs. Given steady funding throughout, the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] developed with some speed. The first launch took place on 15 May 1957 and led to an unintended crash {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} from the site. The first successful test followed on 21 August 1957; the R-7 flew over {{convert|6000|km|abbr=on}} and became the world's first ICBM.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r7.htm |title=R-7 |first=Mark |last=Wade |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref> The first strategic-missile unit became operational on 9 February 1959 at [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]] in north-west Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |title=This Week in EUCOM History: February 6\u201312, 1959 |date=6 February 2012 |publisher=[[EUCOM]] |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003453/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23076/this-week-in-eucom-history-february-6-12-1959 |archivedate=21 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was the same [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] [[launch vehicle]] that placed the first artificial satellite in space, [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], on 4 October 1957. The first [[human spaceflight]] in history was accomplished on a derivative of R-7, [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]], on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]], by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]]. A heavily modernized version of the R-7 is still used as the [[launch vehicle]] for the Soviet/Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], marking more than 60 years of operational history of [[Sergei Korolyov]]'s original rocket design.\n\n[[File:Atlas-B ICBM.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[SM-65 Atlas]], the first US ICBM, first launched in 1957]]\nThe U.S. initiated ICBM research in 1946 with the [[RTV-A-2 Hiroc]] project. This was a three-stage effort with the ICBM development not starting until the third stage. However, funding was cut after only three partially successful launches in 1948 of the second stage design, used to test variations on the V-2 design. With overwhelming air superiority and truly intercontinental bombers, the newly forming [[US Air Force]] did not take the problem of ICBM development seriously. Things changed in 1953 with the Soviet testing of their first [[thermonuclear weapon]], but it was not until 1954 that the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas missile]] program was given the highest national priority. The Atlas A first flew on 11 June 1957; the flight lasted only about 24 seconds before the rocket blew up. The first successful flight of an Atlas missile to full range occurred 28 November 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/space/Atlas.htm |title=Atlas |publisher=Century of Flight |work=The Exploration of Space | accessdate =2012-12-14}}</ref> The first armed version of the Atlas, the Atlas D, was declared operational in January 1959 at Vandenberg, although it had not yet flown. The first test flight was carried out on 9 July 1959,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missilethreat.com/missilesoftheworld/id.15/missile_detail.asp |title=Atlas D |publisher=Missile Threat |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210160153/http://www.missilethreat.com/missilesoftheworld/id.15/missile_detail.asp |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/atlas.htm |title=Atlas |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica | publisher = Astronautix | accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> and the missile was accepted for service on 1 September.\n\nThe R-7 and Atlas each required a large launch facility, making them vulnerable to attack, and could not be kept in a ready state. Failure rates were very high throughout the early years of ICBM technology. Human spaceflight programs ([[Vostok programme|Vostok]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], etc.) served as a highly visible means of demonstrating confidence in reliability, with successes translating directly to national defense implications. The US was well behind the Soviet Union in the [[Space Race]], so U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] increased the stakes with the [[Apollo program]], which used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rocket]] technology that had been funded by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].\n\n[[File:USAF ICBM and NASA Launch Vehicle Flight Test Successes and Failures (highlighted).png|thumb|upright=1.5|1965 graph of USAF [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] and Titan ICBM launches, cumulative by month with failures highlighted (pink), showing how NASA's use of ICBM boosters for Projects Mercury and Gemini (blue) served as a visible demonstration of reliability at a time when failure rates had been substantial.]]\nThese early ICBMs also formed the basis of many space launch systems. Examples include [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], [[Redstone (rocket family)|Redstone]], [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]], and [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]], which was derived from the earlier ICBMs but never deployed as an ICBM. The Eisenhower administration supported the development of solid-fueled missiles such as the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]], [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] and [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]]. Modern ICBMs tend to be smaller than their ancestors, due to increased accuracy and smaller and lighter warheads, and use solid fuels, making them less useful as orbital launch vehicles.\n\nThe Western view of the deployment of these systems was governed by the strategic theory of [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutual Assured Destruction]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, development began on [[Anti-ballistic missile|Anti-Ballistic Missile]] systems by both the U.S. and USSR; these systems were restricted by the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]]. The first successful ABM test were conducted by the USSR in 1961, that later deployed a fully operating system defending Moscow in the 1970s (see [[Anti-ballistic missile#Moscow ABM system|Moscow ABM system]]).\n\nThe 1972 [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] treaty froze the number of ICBM launchers of both the U.S. and the USSR at existing levels, and allowed new submarine-based [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]] launchers only if an equal number of land-based ICBM launchers were dismantled. Subsequent talks, called SALT II, were held from 1972 to 1979 and actually reduced the number of nuclear warheads held by the U.S. and USSR. SALT II was never ratified by the [[United States Senate]], but its terms were nevertheless honored by both sides until 1986, when the Reagan administration \"withdrew\" after accusing the USSR of violating the pact.\n\nIn the 1980s, President [[Ronald Reagan]] launched the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] as well as the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX]] and [[MGM-134 Midgetman|Midgetman]] ICBM programs.\n\nChina developed a minimal independent nuclear deterrent entering its own cold war after an [[Sino-Soviet split|ideological split]] with the Soviet Union beginning in the early 1960s.

MIRV was an outgrowth of the rapidly shrinking size and weight of modern warheads and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties which imposed limitations on the number of launch vehicles ([[SALT I]] and [[SALT II]]). It has also proved to be an \"easy answer\" to proposed deployments of [[Anti-ballistic missile|Anti-ballistic missile (ABM)]] systems\u2014it is far less expensive to add more warheads to an existing missile system than to build an ABM system capable of shooting down the additional warheads; hence, most ABM system proposals have been judged to be impractical. The first operational ABM systems were deployed in the U.S. during the 1970s. [[Safeguard Program|Safeguard ABM]] facility was located in North Dakota and was operational from 1975 to 1976. The USSR deployed its [[ABM-1 Galosh]] system around Moscow in the 1970s, which remains in service.

One of the key features of the first [[embedded system|computer-controlled]] ICBM, the [[Minuteman missile]], was that it could quickly and easily use its computer to test itself.\n\n[[File:SS-24-DIA.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of an [[SS-24]] deployed on railway]]\nAfter launch, a [[Booster (rocketry)|booster]] pushes the missile and then falls away. Most modern boosters are [[solid rocket|solid-fueled rocket motors]], which can be stored easily for long periods of time. Early missiles used [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fueled rocket motors]]. Many liquid-fueled ICBMs could not be kept fueled all the time as the [[cryogenic fuel]] [[liquid oxygen]] boiled off and caused ice formation, and therefore fueling the rocket was necessary before launch. This procedure was a source of significant operational delay, and might allow the missiles to be destroyed by enemy counterparts before they could be used. To resolve this problem the United Kingdom invented the [[missile silo]] that protected the missile from a [[first strike]] and also hid fuelling operations underground.\n\nOnce the booster falls away, the remaining \"bus\" releases several warheads, each of which continues on its own unpowered ballistic [[trajectory]], much like an artillery shell or cannonball. The warhead is encased in a cone-shaped reentry vehicle and is difficult to detect in this phase of flight as there is no rocket exhaust or other emissions to mark its position to defenders. The high speeds of the warheads make them difficult to intercept and allow for little warning, striking targets many thousands of kilometers away from the launch site (and due to the possible locations of the submarines: anywhere in the world) within approximately 30 minutes.\n\nMany authorities say that missiles also release aluminized balloons, electronic noise-makers, and other [[penetration aid|items]] intended to confuse interception devices and radars.\n\nAs the nuclear warhead reenters the Earth's atmosphere its high speed causes compression of the air, leading to a dramatic rise in temperature which would destroy it if it were not shielded in some way. As a result, warhead components are contained within an aluminium [[Honeycomb structure|honeycomb substructure]], sheathed in a [[pyrolytic carbon]]-[[epoxy]] [[synthetic resin]] [[composite material]] heat shield. Warheads are also often radiation-hardened (to protect against nuclear-tipped ABMs or the nearby detonation of friendly warheads), one neutron-resistant material developed for this purpose in the UK is [[three-dimensional quartz phenolic]].\n\n[[Circular error probable]] is crucial, because halving the circular error probable decreases the needed warhead energy by a [[inverse-square law|factor of four]]. Accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the navigation system and the available [[geodesy|geodetic]] information.\n\nStrategic missile systems are thought to use custom [[integrated circuit]]s designed to calculate [[navigation]]al [[differential equation]]s thousands to millions of [[FLOPS]] in order to reduce navigational errors caused by calculation alone. These circuits are usually a network of binary addition circuits that continually recalculate the missile's position. The inputs to the navigation circuit are set by a general purpose computer according to a navigational input schedule loaded into the missile before launch.\n\nOne particular weapon developed by the Soviet Union\u2014the [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System]]\u2014had a partial [[orbit]]al trajectory, and unlike most ICBMs its target could not be deduced from its orbital flight path. It was decommissioned in compliance with arms control agreements, which address the maximum range of ICBMs and prohibit orbital or fractional-orbital weapons. However, according to reports, Russia is working on the new Sarmat ICBM which leverages Fractional Orbital Bombardment concepts to use a Southern polar approach instead of flying over the Northern polar regions. Using this approach, it is theorized, avoids the US missile defense batteries in California and Alaska.\n\nNew development of ICBM technology are ICBMs able to carry hypersonic glide vehicles as a [[payload]] such as [[Sarmat|RS-28 Sarmat]].\n\n== Specific ICBMs ==\n{{Main|Comparison of ICBMs|List of ICBMs}}\n\n=== Land-based ICBMs ===\n[[File:Peacekeeper missile after silo launch.jpg|thumb|A U.S. [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missile launched from a silo]]\n[[File:Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] re-entry vehicles at the [[Kwajalein Atoll]].

This article discusses tune-playing, although \"session\" can also refer to a singing session or a mixed session (tunes and songs).\n\nBarry Foy's ''Field Guide to the Irish Music Session'' defines a session as:<ref>Foy, Barry (2009). ''Field Guide to the Irish Music Session''. Seattle, Wa: Frogchart Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9817590-1-2}}.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''...a gathering of Irish traditional musicians for the purpose of celebrating their common interest in the music by playing it together in a relaxed, informal setting, while in the process generally beefing up the mystical cultural mantra that hums along uninterruptedly beneath all manifestations of Irishness worldwide.''</blockquote>\n\n==Social and cultural aspects==\n[[Image:Mulligans session.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Irish music enthusiasts gather at a pub to play and drink beer]]\nThe general session scheme is that someone starts a tune, and those who know it join in.  Good session etiquette requires not playing if one does not know the tune (or at least quietly playing an [[accompaniment]] part) and waiting until a tune one knows comes along.  In an \"open\" session, anyone who is able to play Irish music is welcome.  Most often there are more-or-less recognized session leaders; sometimes there are no leaders.  At times a song will be sung or a slow air played by a single musician between sets.<ref name=\"PocketHistory\">[[:en:Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 hAllmhur\u00e1in|Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 hAllmhur\u00e1in]]: ''Pocket Guide to Irish Traditional Music'', Third Edition, O'Brien Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86278-820-9}}, p. 188f</ref>\n\nThe objective in a session is not to provide music for an audience of passive listeners; although the ''punters'' (non-playing attendees) often come for the express purpose of listening, the music is most of all for the musicians themselves.  The session is an experience that is shared, not a performance that is bought and sold.\n\nThe sessions are a key aspect of traditional music; it is the main sphere in which the music is formulated and innovated. Further, the sessions enable less advanced musicians to practice in a group. Socially, sessions have often been compared to an evening of playing card games, where the conversation and camaraderie are an essential component. In many rural communities in Ireland, sessions are an integral part of community life.\n\n==Musical aspects==\nTypically, the first tune is followed by another two or three tunes in a ''set''. The art of putting together a set is hard to put into words, but the tunes must flow from one to another in terms of key and melodic structure, without being so similar as to all sound the same. The tunes of a set will usually all be of the same sort, i.e. all [[jig]]s or all [[reel (dance)|reels]], although on rare occasions and amongst a more skilled group of players a complementary tune of a different sort will be included, such as a [[slip jig]] amongst the [[jig]]s.  Although stage performers sometimes arrange sets of reels and jigs together, this is uncommon in an Irish session context. \n\nSome sets are specific to a locale, or even to a single session, whilst others, like the \"Coleman set\" of reels (\"The Tarbolton\"/\"The Longford Collector\"/The Sailor's Bonnet\"), represent longstanding combinations that have been played together for decades. Sets are sometimes thrown together ''ad hoc'', which sometimes works brilliantly and sometimes fails on the spot.\n\nThe term 'set' is used for groups of three or more tunes, and for the 'set' dances which those tunes were originally arranged and played for. As the music was originally played for dancers, typically at 'house dances', a large number of standard sets (of tunes) were developed to suit the various dance sets. Over a hundred standard sets have been recorded by Comhaltas Ceolteoiri na hEirenann (generally known as 'Comhaltas') at sessions in Dublin and Clare and released on three CDs in the 'Foinn Seisiun' series. Comhaltas has also published the musical notation for the tunes in three volumes.\n\nAfter one set ends, someone will usually start another. A 'regular' at the session may launch into a set, knowing that many or all of the musicians know the tunes; a visitor starting a set will check that at least some of the other musicians know the tunes. While there may be occasional singing at a session, solo playing is not part of the session, nor is the session an opportunity to 'show off', or demonstrate 'party pieces'. The origin and spirit of the session, playing standard sets for dancers, ensures that individual musical virtuosity is less valued than the collective effort. It also ensures that visitors from other sessions will know many of the tunes and be able to participate, in true 'both\u00e1ntiocht' style (see Peig below).\n\n==Locations and times==\n[[Image:Nash-session.jpg|thumb|A Dublin [[pub session]]]] \nSessions are usually held in [[public house]]s or [[tavern]]s.  A pub owner might have one or two musicians paid to come regularly in order for the session to have a base.<ref name=\"Companion\">Fintan Vallely (Editor): ''Companion to Irish Traditional Music'' Second Edition, Cork University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-85918-450-9}}, p. 610f</ref> These musicians can perform during any gaps during the day or evening when no other performers are there and wish to play. Sunday afternoons and weekday nights (especially Tuesday and Wednesday) are common times for sessions to be scheduled, on the theory that these are the least likely times for dances and concerts to be held, and therefore the times that professional musicians will be most able to show up.\n\nSessions can be held in homes or at various public places in addition to pubs; often at a festival sessions will be got together in the beer tent or in the vendor's booth of a music-loving craftsperson or dealer.  When a particularly large musical event \"takes over\" an entire village, spontaneous sessions may erupt on the street corners. Sessions may also take place occasionally at [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]s.

It is also a common cause of the flooding of houses when water pipes burst due to the pressure of expanding water when it freezes.\n\nThe result of this process is that ice (in its most common form) floats on liquid water, which is an important feature in Earth's [[biosphere]].

During the melting process, the temperature remains constant at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. While melting, any energy added breaks the hydrogen bonds between ice (water) molecules. Energy becomes available to increase the thermal energy (temperature) only after enough hydrogen bonds are broken that the ice can be considered liquid water. The amount of energy consumed in breaking hydrogen bonds in the transition from ice to water is known as the ''[[heat of fusion]]''.\n\nAs with water, ice absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum preferentially as the result of an overtone of an oxygen\u2013hydrogen (O\u2013H) bond stretch. Compared with water, this absorption is shifted toward slightly lower energies. Thus, ice appears blue, with a slightly greener tint than liquid water. Since absorption is cumulative, the color effect intensifies with increasing thickness or if internal reflections cause the light to take a longer path through the ice.<ref name=color>{{cite book|author1=Lynch, David K.  |author2=Livingston, William Charles |title=Color and light in nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&pg=PA161|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77504-5|pages=161\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOther colors can appear in the presence of light absorbing impurities, where the impurity is dictating the color rather than the ice itself.

This explanation, called \"pressure melting\", originated in the 19th century. It, however, did not account for skating on ice temperatures lower than {{convert|\u22124|C|F K|0}}, which is often skated upon.\n\nA second theory describing the coefficient of friction of ice suggested that ice molecules at the interface cannot properly bond with the molecules of the mass of ice beneath (and thus are free to move like molecules of liquid water). These molecules remain in a semi-liquid state, providing lubrication regardless of pressure against the ice exerted by any object.

Ice is an important component of the global climate, particularly in regard to the water cycle. Glaciers and [[snowpack]]s are an important storage mechanism for fresh water; over time, they may sublimate or melt. [[Snowmelt]] is an important source of seasonal fresh water. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] defines several kinds of ice depending on origin, size, shape, influence and so on.<ref name=wmo>[http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/volume1.php?lang1=0&lang2=1&arrange=0&self=0 \"WMO SEA-ICE NOMENCLATURE\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124444/http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/volume1.php?lang1=0&lang2=1&arrange=0&self=0 |date=5 June 2013 }} ([http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/wmo_259.php Multi-language] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414141500/http://www.aari.nw.ru/gdsidb/XML/wmo_259.php |date=14 April 2012 }}) ''World Meteorological Organization'' / ''[[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]]''. Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> [[Clathrate hydrate]]s are forms of ice that contain gas molecules trapped within its crystal lattice.\n\n===On the oceans===\n{{main|Sea ice}}\nIce that is found at sea may be in the form of [[drift ice]] floating in the water, [[fast ice]] fixed to a shoreline or [[anchor ice]] if attached to the sea bottom. Ice which [[Ice calving|calves]] (breaks off) from an [[ice shelf]] or glacier may become an iceberg. Sea ice can be forced together by currents and winds to form [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridges]] up to {{convert|12|m}} tall. Navigation through areas of sea ice occurs in openings called \"[[polynya]]s\" or \"[[Lead (sea ice)|leads]]\" or requires the use of a special ship called an \"[[icebreaker]]\".\n\n===On land and structures===\n[[File:Icy Japanese Maple branch, Boxborough, Massachusetts, 2008.jpg|thumb|Ice on deciduous tree after [[freezing rain]]]]\nIce on land ranges from the largest type called an \"[[ice sheet]]\" to smaller [[ice cap]]s and [[ice field]]s to glaciers and [[ice stream]]s to the [[snow line]] and [[snow field]]s.\n\n[[Aufeis]] is layered ice that forms in Arctic and subarctic stream valleys. Ice, frozen in the stream bed, blocks normal groundwater discharge, and causes the local water table to rise, resulting in water discharge on top of the frozen layer. This water then freezes, causing the water table to rise further and repeat the cycle. The result is a stratified ice deposit, often several meters thick.\n\n[[Freezing rain]] is a type of winter storm called an [[ice storm]] where rain falls and then freezes producing a [[glaze ice|glaze]] of ice. Ice can also form icicles, similar to [[stalactite]]s in appearance, or [[stalagmite]]-like forms as water drips and re-freezes.\n\nThe term \"ice dam\" has three meanings (others discussed below). On structures, an [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dam]] is the buildup of ice on a sloped roof which stops melt water from draining properly and can cause damage from water leaks in buildings.\n\n===On rivers and streams===\n[[File:Frozen rivulet in Pennsylvania.JPG|thumb|A small frozen [[rivulet]]]]\nIce which forms on moving water tends to be less uniform and stable than ice which forms on calm water. [[Ice jam]]s (sometimes called \"ice dams\"), when broken chunks of ice pile up, are the greatest ice hazard on rivers. Ice jams can cause flooding, damage structures in or near the river, and damage vessels on the river. Ice jams can cause some [[hydropower]] industrial facilities to completely shut down. An ice dam is a blockage from the movement of a glacier which may produce a [[proglacial lake]]. Heavy ice flows in rivers can also damage vessels and require the use of an icebreaker to keep navigation possible.\n\n[[Ice disc]]s are circular formations of ice surrounded by water in a river.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pS4ET4D4iKYC&pg=PP140&dq=Ice+discs+are+circular+formations+of+ice+surrounded+by+water+in+a+river&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix64K6lLXVAhWoxVQKHSS0AFAQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Ice%20discs%20are%20circular%20formations%20of%20ice%20surrounded%20by%20water%20in%20a%20river&f=false|title=Crop Circles Revealed|last=Moore|first=Judith|last2=Lamb|first2=Barbara|date=2001-10-15|publisher=Light Technology Publishing|isbn=9781622335619|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Pancake ice]] is a formation of ice generally created in areas with less calm conditions.\n\n===On lakes{{anchor|Ice_on_lakes}}===\nIce forms on calm water from the shores, a thin layer spreading across the surface, and then downward. Ice on lakes is generally four types: Primary, secondary, superimposed and agglomerate.<ref>Petrenko, Victor F. and Whitworth, Robert W. (1999) ''Physics of ice''.

Superimposed ice forms on top of the ice surface from rain or water which seeps up through cracks in the ice which often settles when loaded with snow.\n\n[[Shelf ice]] occurs when floating pieces of ice are driven by the wind piling up on the windward shore.\n\n[[Candle ice]] is a form of [[rotten ice]] that develops in columns perpendicular to the surface of a lake.\n\n===In the air===\n\n[[File:Ice formation on vehicle windshield.JPG|thumb|Ice formation on vehicle windshield]]\n\n====Rime ice====\nRime is a type of ice formed on cold objects when drops of water crystallize on them. This can be observed in [[fog]]gy weather, when the temperature drops during the night. [[Soft rime]] contains a high proportion of trapped air, making it appear white rather than transparent, and giving it a density about one quarter of that of pure ice. [[Hard rime]] is comparatively dense.\n\n====Ice pellets====\n{{Main|Ice pellets}}\n[[File:Sleet on the ground.jpg|thumb|right|An accumulation of ice pellets]]\n[[Ice pellets]] are a form of precipitation consisting of small, [[translucent]] balls of ice.

This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface.

The ordering of the molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid melts to become a liquid. This is achieved by increasing the internal energy of the ice beyond the [[melting point]]. When ice melts it absorbs as much energy as would be required to heat an equivalent amount of water by 80&nbsp;\u00b0C. While melting, the temperature of the ice surface remains constant at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. The velocity of the melting process depends on the efficiency of the energy exchange process. An ice surface in [[fresh water]] melts solely by [[free convection]] with a velocity that depends linearly on the water temperature, ''T''<sub>\u221e</sub>, when ''T''<sub>\u221e</sub> is less than 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C, and superlinearly when ''T''<sub>\u221e</sub> is equal to or greater than 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the rate being proportional to (T<sub>\u221e</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3.98&nbsp;\u00b0C)<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>, with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|5|3}} for ''T''<sub>\u221e</sub> much greater than 8&nbsp;\u00b0C, and \u03b1&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|4|3}} for inbetween temperatures ''T''<sub>\u221e</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Keitzl|first1=Thomas|last2=Mellado|first2=Juan Pedro|last3=Notz|first3=Dirk|title=Impact of Thermally Driven Turbulence on the Bottom Melting of Ice|journal=J.

For example, the temperature of the [[Arctic Ocean]] is generally below the melting point of ablating sea ice. The phase transition from solid to liquid is achieved by mixing [[salt]] and water molecules, similar to the dissolution of [[sugar]] in water, even though the water temperature is far below the melting point of the sugar. Hence dissolution is rate limited by salt transport whereas melting can occur at much higher rates that are characteristic for [[heat transport]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Andrew W.|title=Melting and dissolving|journal=J.

Ice also presents a challenge to transportation in various forms and a setting for winter sports.\n\n===Cooling===\nIce has long been valued as a means of cooling. In 400 BC Iran, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] engineers had already mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert. The ice was brought in during the winters from nearby mountains in bulk amounts, and stored in specially designed, naturally cooled ''refrigerators'', called [[yakhchal]] (meaning ''ice storage''). This was a large underground space (up to 5000 m<sup>3</sup>) that had thick walls (at least two meters at the base) made of a special mortar called ''[[sarooj]]'', composed of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, and which was known to be resistant to heat transfer. This mixture was thought to be completely water impenetrable. The space often had access to a [[qanat]], and often contained a system of [[windcatcher]]s which could easily bring temperatures inside the space down to frigid levels on summer days. The ice was used to chill treats for royalty.\n\n====Harvesting====\n{{Main|Ice cutting}}\n[[File:Ice Harvesting on Lake St Clair Michigan circa 1905--photograph courtesy Detroit Publishing Company.jpg|thumb|Harvesting ice on [[Lake St. Clair]] in [[Michigan]], c. 1905]]\nThere were thriving industries in 16th/17th century England whereby low-lying areas along the [[Thames Estuary]] were flooded during the winter, and ice harvested in carts and stored inter-seasonally in insulated wooden houses as a provision to an icehouse often located in large country houses, and widely used to keep fish fresh when caught in distant waters. This was allegedly copied by an Englishman who had seen the same activity in China. Ice was imported into England from Norway on a considerable scale as early as 1823.<ref name=cne>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Ice}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the first cargo of ice was sent from New York City to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1799,<ref name=cne/> and by the first half of the 19th century, ice harvesting had become big business. [[Frederic Tudor]], who became known as the \"Ice King\", worked on developing better insulation products for the long distance shipment of ice, especially to the tropics; this became known as the [[ice trade]].\n\n[[Trieste]] sent ice to [[Egypt]], [[Corfu]], and [[Zante]]; Switzerland sent it to France; and Germany sometimes was supplied from [[Bavaria]]n lakes.<ref name=cne/> The [[Hungarian Parliament]] building used ice harvested in the winter from [[Lake Balaton]] for air conditioning.\n\n[[Ice house (building)|Ice house]]s were used to store ice formed in the winter, to make ice available all year long, and early [[refrigerator]]s were known as [[icebox]]es, because they had a block of ice in them. In many cities, it was not unusual to have a regular ice [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]] service during the summer. The advent of artificial refrigeration technology has since made delivery of ice obsolete.\n\nIce is still harvested for [[List of ice and snow sculpture events|ice and snow sculpture events]].

Stand-alone icemaker units that make ice cubes are often called ice machines.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nIce can present challenges to safe transportation on land, sea and in the air.\n\n====Land travel====\n[[File:S\u00f6dert\u00e4ljev\u00e4gen vinter 2013a 01.jpg|thumb|Road ice decreases tire traction, thereby affecting driving safety.]]\nIce forming on [[road]]s is a dangerous winter hazard. [[Black ice]] is very difficult to see, because it lacks the expected frosty surface. Whenever there is freezing rain or snow which occurs at a temperature near the melting point, it is common for ice to build up on the [[window]]s of vehicles. Driving safely requires the removal of the ice build-up. [[Ice scraper]]s are tools designed to break the ice free and clear the windows, though removing the ice can be a long and laborious process.\n\nFar enough below the freezing point, a thin layer of ice crystals can form on the inside surface of windows. This usually happens when a vehicle has been left alone after being driven for a while, but can happen while driving, if the outside temperature is low enough. Moisture from the driver's breath is the source of water for the crystals. It is troublesome to remove this form of ice, so people often open their windows slightly when the vehicle is parked in order to let the moisture dissipate, and it is now common for cars to have rear-window [[defroster]]s to solve the problem. A similar problem can happen in homes, which is one reason why many colder regions require [[Insulated glazing|double-pane windows]] for insulation.\n\nWhen the outdoor temperature stays below freezing for extended periods, very thick layers of ice can form on [[lake]]s and other bodies of water, although places with flowing water require much colder temperatures. The ice can become thick enough to drive onto with [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s. Doing this safely requires a thickness of at least 30&nbsp;cm (one foot).\n\n====Water-borne travel====\n[[File:Frozen Lake Huron- icebreakers and commercial vessels.jpg|thumb|Channel through ice for ship traffic on [[Lake Huron]] with [[ice breaker]]s in background]]\nFor ships, ice presents two distinct hazards. Spray and freezing rain can produce an ice build-up on the superstructure of a vessel sufficient to make it unstable, and to require it to be hacked off or melted with steam hoses. And icebergs&nbsp;\u2013 large masses of ice floating in water (typically created when [[glacier]]s reach the sea)&nbsp;\u2013 can be dangerous if struck by a ship when underway. Icebergs have been responsible for the sinking of many ships, the most famous being the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]. For [[harbor]]s near the [[geographical pole|pole]]s, being ice-free is an important advantage. Ideally, all year long. Examples are [[Murmansk]] (Russia), [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] (Russia, formerly Finland) and [[Vard\u00f8 (town)|Vard\u00f8]] (Norway). Harbors which are not ice-free are opened up using [[icebreaker]]s.\n\n====Air travel====\n[[File:Some Ice on the boots (1527659244).jpg|thumb|Rime ice on the leading edge of an aircraft wing, partially released by the [[Ice protection system|black pneumatic boot]].]]\nFor aircraft, ice can cause a number of dangers. As an aircraft climbs, it passes through air layers of different temperature and humidity, some of which may be conducive to ice formation. If ice forms on the wings or control surfaces, this may adversely affect the flying qualities of the aircraft. During the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop flight across the Atlantic]], the British aviators Captain [[John Alcock (RAF officer)|John Alcock]] and Lieutenant [[Arthur Whitten Brown]] encountered such icing conditions&nbsp;\u2013 Brown left the cockpit and climbed onto the wing several times to remove ice which was covering the engine air intakes of the [[Vickers Vimy]] aircraft they were flying.\n\nOne vulnerability effected by icing that is associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines is the [[carburetor]]. As air is sucked through the carburetor into the engine, the local air pressure is lowered, which causes [[adiabatic]] cooling. Thus, in humid near-freezing conditions, the carburetor will be colder, and tend to ice up. This will block the supply of air to the engine, and cause it to fail. For this reason, aircraft reciprocating engines with carburetors are provided with [[Carburetor heat|carburetor air intake heaters]]. The increasing use of [[fuel injection]]\u2014which does not require carburetors\u2014has made \"carb icing\" less of an issue for reciprocating engines.\n\nJet engines do not experience carb icing, but recent evidence indicates that they can be slowed, stopped, or damaged by internal icing in certain types of atmospheric conditions much more easily than previously believed. In most cases, the engines can be quickly restarted and flights are not endangered, but research continues to determine the exact conditions which produce this type of icing, and find the best methods to prevent, or reverse it, in flight.\n\n===Recreation and sports===\n{{Main|Ice sports}}\n[[File:SCENEONICE.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'' by 17th century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]]]]\n\nIce also plays a central role in winter recreation and in many sports such as [[ice skating]], [[tour skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[bandy]], [[ice fishing]], [[ice climbing]], [[curling]], [[broomball]] and sled racing on [[bobsled]], [[luge]] and [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]]. Many of the different sports played on ice get international attention every four years during the [[Winter Olympic Games]].\n\nA sort of sailboat on blades gives rise to [[ice yachting]]. Another sport is [[ice racing]], where drivers must speed on lake ice, while also controlling the skid of their vehicle (similar in some ways to [[dirt track racing]]). The sport has even been modified for [[ice rink]]s.\n\n===Other uses===\n*[[Ice cube|Ice cubes]] or [[crushed ice]] can be used to cool drinks. As the ice melts, it absorbs heat and keeps the drink near {{convert|0|C}}.\n* Ice can be used to reduce swelling (by decreasing blood flow) and pain by pressing it against an area of the body.<ref>{{cite book | title=The U.S. Navy Seal Guide to Fitness and Nutrition | first1=Patricia A. | last1=Deuster | first2=Anita | last2=Singh | first3=Pierre A. | last3=Pelletier | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. | year=2007 | isbn=1-60239-030-4 | page=117 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3P038jE18BwC&pg=PT117 }}</ref>\n[[File:USNS Southern Cross at the ice pier in 1983.jpg|thumb|Ice pier during 1983 cargo operations.

Temporarily, even a railroad has been built on ice.<ref name=\"Makkonen, L. 1994\"/>\n* During World War II, [[Project Habbakuk]] was an Allied programme which investigated the use of [[pykrete]] (wood fibers mixed with ice) as a possible material for warships, especially aircraft carriers, due to the ease with which a vessel immune to torpedoes, and a large deck, could be constructed by ice.

The best known example is [[dry ice]], the solid form of [[carbon dioxide]].\n\nA \"magnetic analogue\" of ice is also realized in some insulating magnetic materials in which the magnetic moments mimic the position of protons in water ice and obey energetic constraints similar to the Bernal-Fowler [[ice rules]] arising from the [[geometrical frustration]] of the proton configuration in water ice.

Sodium loses its outer [[electron]] to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally. The oppositely charged ions &ndash; typically a great many of them &ndash; are then attracted to each other to form a solid.]]\n'''Ionic bonding''' is a type of [[chemical bond]]ing that involves the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic attraction]] between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have gained one or more [[electrons]] (known as [[anion]]s, which are negatively charged) and atoms that have lost one or more electrons (known as [[cation]]s, which are positively charged). This transfer of electrons is known as '''electrovalence''' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like {{chem|NH|4|+}} or {{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}. In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a [[metal]] to a [[non-metal]] in order to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.\n\nIt is important to recognize that ''clean'' ionic bonding \u2013 in which one atom or molecule completely transfers an electron to another cannot exist: all ionic compounds have some degree of [[covalent bond]]ing, or electron sharing. Thus, the term \"ionic bonding\" is given when the ionic character is greater than the covalent character \u2013 that is, a bond in which a large [[electronegativity]] difference exists between the two atoms, causing the bonding to be more polar (ionic) than in covalent bonding where electrons are shared more equally. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called [[polar covalent bond]]s. \n\nIonic compounds conduct [[electricity]] when molten or in solution, typically as a solid. Ionic compounds generally have a high [[melting point]], depending on the charge of the ions they consist of. The higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting point. They also tend to be [[Solubility|soluble]] in water; the stronger the cohesive forces, the lower the solubility. \n\n==Overview==\nAtoms that have an almost full or almost empty [[valence shell]] tend to be very [[chemical reaction|reactive]]. Atoms that are strongly electronegative (as is the case with [[halogens]]) often have only one or two empty orbitals in their valence shell, and frequently [[chemical bond|bond]] with other molecules or gain electrons to form [[anions]]. Atoms that are weakly electronegative (such as [[alkali metals]]) have relatively few valence electrons, which can easily be shared with atoms that are strongly electronegative. As a result, weakly electronegative atoms tend to distort their electron cloud and form [[cations]].\n\n==Formation==\nIonic bonding can result from a [[redox]] reaction when atoms of an element (usually [[metal]]), whose [[ionization energy]] is low, give some of their electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In doing so, cations are formed. An atom of another element (usually nonmetal) with greater [[electron affinity]] accepts the electron(s) to attain a stable electron configuration, and after accepting electron(s) an atom becomes an anion. Typically, the stable electron configuration is one of the [[noble gases]] for elements in the [[s-block]] and the [[p-block]], and particular [[electron configuration|stable electron configurations]] for [[d-block]] and [[f-block]] elements. The electrostatic attraction between the anions and cations leads to the formation of a solid with a [[crystallographic lattice]] in which the ions are stacked in an alternating fashion. In such a lattice, it is usually not possible to distinguish discrete molecular units, so that the compounds formed are not molecular in nature. However, the ions themselves can be complex and form molecular ions like the acetate anion or the ammonium cation.\n\nFor example, common [[table salt]] is [[sodium chloride]]. When [[sodium]] (Na) and [[chlorine]] (Cl) are combined, the sodium atoms each lose an [[electron]], forming cations (Na<sup>+</sup>), and the chlorine atoms each gain an electron to form anions (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>). These ions are then attracted to each other in a 1:1 ratio to form sodium chloride (NaCl).\n: Na + Cl \u2192 Na<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 NaCl \n\nHowever, to maintain charge neutrality, strict ratios between anions and cations are observed so that ionic compounds, in general, obey the rules of stoichiometry despite not being molecular compounds. For compounds that are transitional to the alloys and possess mixed ionic and metallic bonding, this may not be the case anymore. Many sulfides, e.g., do form non-stoichiometric compounds.\n\nMany ionic compounds are referred to as '''salts''' as they can also be formed by the neutralization reaction of an Arrhenius base like NaOH with an Arrhenius acid like HCl\n\n: NaOH + HCl \u2192  NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O\n  \nThe salt NaCl is then said to consist of the acid rest Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> and the base rest Na<sup>+</sup>.\n\n[[Image:Ionic bonding.svg|thumb|right|225px|Representation of ionic bonding between [[lithium]] and [[fluorine]] to form [[lithium fluoride]]. Lithium has a low ionization energy and readily gives up its lone [[valence electron]] to a fluorine atom, which has a positive electron affinity and accepts the electron that was donated by the lithium atom. The end-result is that lithium is [[isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] with [[helium]] and fluorine is isoelectronic with [[neon]]. Electrostatic interaction occurs between the two resulting ions, but typically aggregation is not limited to two of them. Instead, aggregation into a whole lattice held together by ionic bonding is the result.]] \n\nThe removal of electrons from the cation is endothermic, raising the system's overall energy. There may also be energy changes associated with breaking of existing bonds or the addition of more than one electron to form anions. However, the action of the anion's accepting the cation's valence electrons and the subsequent attraction of the ions to each other releases (lattice) energy and, thus, lowers the overall energy of the system.\n\nIonic bonding will occur only if the overall energy change for the reaction is favorable. In general, the reaction is exothermic, but, e.g., the formation of mercuric oxide (HgO) is endothermic. The charge of the resulting ions is a major factor in the strength of ionic bonding, e.g. a salt C<sup>+</sup>A<sup>\u2212</sup> is held together by electrostatic forces roughly four times weaker than C<sup>2+</sup>A<sup>2\u2212</sup> according to Coulombs law, where C and A represent a generic cation and anion respectively. The sizes of the ions and the particular packing of the lattice are ignored in this rather simplistic argument.\n\n==Structures==\n{{Main|Ionic compound}}\nIonic compounds in the solid state form lattice structures. The two principal factors in determining the form of the lattice are the relative charges of the ions and their relative sizes. Some structures are adopted by a number of compounds; for example, the structure of the rock salt [[sodium chloride]] is also adopted by many [[alkali metals|alkali]] halides, and binary oxides such as [[magnesium oxide]]. [[Pauling's rules]] provide guidelines for predicting and rationalizing the crystal structures of ionic crystals\n\n==Strength of the bonding==\n{{main|Lattice energy}}\n\nFor a solid crystalline ionic compound the [[enthalpy]] change in forming the solid from gaseous ions is termed the [[lattice energy]].\nThe experimental value for the [[lattice energy]] can  be determined using the [[Born\u2013Haber cycle]]. It can also be calculated (predicted) using the [[Born\u2013Land\u00e9 equation]] as the sum of the [[electrostatic potential energy]], calculated by summing interactions between cations and anions, and a short-range repulsive potential energy term. The electrostatic potential can be expressed in terms of the interionic separation and a constant ([[Madelung constant]]) that takes account of the geometry of the crystal. The further away from the nucleus the weaker the shield. The [[Born-Land\u00e9 equation]] gives a reasonable fit to the lattice energy of, e.g., sodium chloride, where the calculated (predicted) value is \u2212756&nbsp;kJ/mol, which compares to \u2212787&nbsp;kJ/mol using the [[Born\u2013Haber cycle]].<ref>David Arthur Johnson, ''Metals and Chemical Change'', Open University, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2002, {{ISBN|0-85404-665-8}}</ref><ref>Linus Pauling, ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry'', Cornell University Press, 1960 {{ISBN|0-801-40333-2}}  {{DOI|10.1021/ja01355a027}}</ref>\n\n==Polarization effects==\n[[Ion]]s in [[crystal lattice]]s of purely ionic compounds are [[sphere|spherical]]; however, if the positive ion is small and/or highly charged, it will distort the electron cloud of the negative ion, an effect summarised in [[Fajans' rules]]. This [[Polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] of the negative ion leads to a build-up of extra charge density between the two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], that is, to partial covalency. Larger negative ions are more easily polarized, but the effect is usually important only when positive ions with [[electrical charge|charges]] of 3+ (e.g., Al<sup>3+</sup>) are involved. However, 2+ ions (Be<sup>2+</sup>) or even 1+ (Li<sup>+</sup>) show some polarizing power because their sizes are so small (e.g., LiI is ionic but has some covalent bonding present).  Note that this is not the [[ionic polarization]] effect that refers to displacement of ions in the lattice due to the application of an electric field.\n\n==Comparison with covalent bonding==\nIn ionic bonding, the atoms are bound by attraction of oppositely charged ions, whereas, in [[covalent bond]]ing, atoms are bound by sharing electrons to attain stable electron configurations. In covalent bonding, the [[molecular geometry]] around each atom is determined by valence shell electron pair repulsion [[VSEPR]] rules, whereas, in ionic materials, the geometry follows maximum [[close-packing|packing]] rules. One could say that covalent bonding is more ''directional'' in the sense that the energy penalty for not adhering to the optimum bond angles is large, whereas ionic bonding has no such penalty. There are no shared electron pairs to repel each other, the ions should simply be packed as efficiently as possible. This often leads to much higher [[coordination number]]s. In NaCl, each ion has 6 bonds and all bond angles are 90\u00b0. In CsCl the coordination number is 8. By comparison carbon typically has a maximum of four bonds.\n\nPurely ionic bonding cannot exist, as the proximity of the entities involved in the bonding allows some degree of sharing [[electron density]] between them. Therefore, all ionic bonding has some covalent character. Thus, bonding is considered ionic where the ionic character is greater than the covalent character. The larger the difference in [[electronegativity]] between the two types of atoms involved in the bonding, the more ionic (polar) it is. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called [[polar covalent bond]]s. For example, Na\u2013Cl and Mg\u2013O interactions have a few percent covalency, while Si\u2013O bonds are usually ~50% ionic and ~50% covalent. [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]] estimated that an electronegativity difference of 1.7 (on the [[Electronegativity#Pauling electronegativity|Pauling scale)]] corresponds to 50% ionic character, so that a difference greater than 1.7 corresponds to a bond which is predominantly ionic.<ref>L. Pauling ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' (3rd ed., Oxford University Press 1960) p.98-100.</ref>\nIonic character in covalent bonds can be directly measured for atoms having quadrupolar nuclei (<sup>2</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>N, <sup>81,79</sup>Br, <sup>35,37</sup>Cl or <sup>127</sup>I). These nuclei are generally objects of NQR [[nuclear quadrupole resonance]] and NMR [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] studies. Interactions between the nuclear quadrupole moments ''Q'' and the electric field gradients (EFG) are characterized via the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants\n:QCC = {{sfrac|''e''<sup>2</sup>''q''<sub>zz</sub>''Q''|''h''}} \nwhere the ''eq''<sub>zz</sub> term corresponds to the principal component of the EFG tensor and ''e'' is the elementary charge. In turn, the electric field gradient opens the way to description of bonding modes in molecules when the QCC values are accurately determined by NMR or NQR methods.  \n\nIn general, when ionic bonding occurs in the solid (or liquid) state, it is not possible to talk about a single \"ionic bond\" between two individual atoms, because the cohesive forces that keep the lattice together are of a more collective nature. This is quite different in the case of covalent bonding, where we can often speak of a distinct bond localized between two particular atoms. However, even if ionic bonding is combined with some covalency, the result is ''not'' necessarily discrete bonds of a localized character. In such cases, the resulting bonding often requires description in terms of a band structure consisting of gigantic molecular orbitals spanning the entire crystal. Thus, the bonding in the solid often retains its collective rather than localized nature. When the difference in electronegativity is decreased, the bonding may then lead to a semiconductor, a semimetal or eventually a metallic conductor with metallic bonding.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coulomb's law]]\n*[[Ionic potential]]\n*[[Linear combination of atomic orbitals]]\n*[[Orbital hybridization|Hybridization]]\n*[[Chemical polarity]]\n*[[Ioliomics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chemteam.info/Bonding/Ionic-Bond.html Ionic bonding tutorial]\n*[http://sciencehack.com/videos/view/xTx_DWboEVs Video on ionic bonding]\n\n{{Chemical bonds}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ionic Bond}}\n[[Category:Chemical bonding]]\n[[Category:Ions]]\n[[Category:Supramolecular chemistry]]", "sha1": "srjnwdr1pojav3vsol9na08m9o15uq0"}}, {"title": "IBF (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "14952", "revision": {"id": "650872764", "parentid": "596785727", "timestamp": "2015-03-11T07:36:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Snowsuit Wearer", "id": "19641692"}, "minor": "", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''IBF''' may refer to:\n\n==Business==\n*[[International Banking Facility]] (IBF) is a legal entity of a US bank\n*[[Irish Banking Federation]], a banking representative body in Ireland\n\n==Sports==\n*[[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF) is one of several boxing organisations\n* International Bandy Federation, former name of [[Federation of International Bandy]] (FIB), the international governing body for bandy\n* International Badminton Federation, former name of [[Badminton World Federation]] (BWF), the international governing body for badminton\n*[[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF), the international governing body for baseball\n*[[International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA), the international governing body for basketball\n*[[Iran Basketball Federation]] (IBF) is a basketball league in Iran\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "2hgepoephayip0e1c7xzi2dlvrp8epp"}}, {"title": "IOC/Presidents", "ns": "0", "id": "14953", "redirect": {"title": "President of the International Olympic Committee"}, "revision": {"id": "733082161", "parentid": "704208131", "timestamp": "2016-08-05T07:16:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[President of the International Olympic Committee]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[President of the International Olympic Committee]]", "sha1": "2ubg5u60bmat2waxoumxnma2g9vieu0"}}, {"title": "Immune system", "ns": "0", "id": "14958", "revision": {"id": "865527259", "parentid": "864776645", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T13:32:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "CV9933", "id": "23856855"}, "comment": "CS1 maint - template details.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{short description|A biological system that protects an organism against disease}}\n[[File:Neutrophil with anthrax copy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A [[scanning electron microscope]] image of a single [[neutrophil]] (yellow), engulfing [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax]] bacteria (orange)]]\nThe '''immune system''' is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and [[biological process|processes]] within an [[organism]] that protects against [[disease]].

Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by \"memory cells\". Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.\n\n=== Lymphocytes ===\nThe cells of the adaptive immune system are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes.

T cells recognize a \"non-self\" target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a \"self\" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the [[cytotoxic T cell|killer T cell]] and the [[T helper cell|helper T cell]]. In addition there are [[regulatory T cells]] which  have a role in modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to [[Major histocompatibility complex#MHC class I|Class I MHC]] molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to [[Major histocompatibility complex#MHC class II|Class II MHC]] molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell.

Additionally, proteins such as [[NFIL3]], which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/sleep-immune-system-body-clock_n_4235943.html |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of [[cortisol]], [[epinephrine]], and [[norepinephrine]] induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, [[interleukin-12]], [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IFN-gamma]]. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response).  In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the [[Th1 cell|T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2]] cytokine balance towards one that supports T<sub>h</sub>1, an increase in overall T<sub>h</sub> cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Besedovsky L, Lange T, Born J | title = Sleep and immune function | journal = Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv | volume = 463 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u201337 | date = Jan 2012 | pmid = 22071480 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0 | pmc=3256323}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and [[catecholamine]]s, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of [[melatonin]]. Inflammation causes a great deal of [[oxidative stress]] and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep/ |title=Can Better Sleep Mean Catching fewer Colds? |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509003219/http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep |archivedate=9 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Nutrition and diet ===\n[[Overnutrition]] is associated with diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]], which are known to affect immune function.

The wort is boiled cooled and fermented and the beer is subjected to a finishing stage, which includes aging, to produce the final beverage. The improvement comprises subjecting the beer to a cold stage comprising rapidly cooling the beer to a temperature of about its freezing point in such a manner that ice crystals are formed therein in only minimal amounts. The resulting cooled beer is then mixed for a short period of time with a beer slurry containing ice crystals, without any appreciable collateral increase in the amount of ice crystals in the resulting mixture.

''Bud Ice'' has a somewhat lower alcohol content than most other ice beer brands. In 1995, Anheuser-Busch also introduced two other major brands: ''Busch Ice'' (5.9% ABV, introduced 1995) and ''Natural Ice'' (also 5.9% ABV, also introduced in 1995).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''Natural Ice'' is the No. 1 selling ice beer brand in the United States; its low price makes it very popular on college campuses all over the country. Keystone Ice, a value-based subdivision of Coors, also produces a 5.9% ABV brew labeled ''Keystone Ice''.\n\nCommon ice beer brands in Canada in 2017, with approximately 5.5 to 6 per cent alcohol content, include Carling Ice, Molson Keystone Ice, Molson's Black Ice, Busch Ice, Old Milwaukee Ice, Brick's Laker Ice and [[Labatt]] Ice.

This concept is used in [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. The term ''identity element'' is often shortened to ''identity'' (as will be done in this article) when there is no possibility of confusion, but the identity implicitly depends on the binary operation it is associated with.\n\nLet {{math|(''S'',\u2009\u2217)}} be a set&nbsp;{{mvar|S}} with a binary operation&nbsp;\u2217 on it. Then an element&nbsp;{{mvar|e}} of&nbsp;{{mvar|S}} is called a '''[[left and right (algebra)|left]] identity''' if {{math|1=''e'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''a''}} for all&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|S}}, and a '''[[left and right (algebra)|right]] identity''' if {{math|1=''a'' \u2217 ''e'' = ''a''}} for all&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|S}}. If {{mvar|e}} is both a left identity and a right identity, then it is called a '''two-sided identity''', or simply an '''identity'''.\n\nAn identity with respect to addition is called an [[additive identity]] (often denoted as&nbsp;0) and an identity with respect to multiplication is called a [[multiplicative identity]] (often denoted as&nbsp;1). These need not be ordinary addition and multiplication, but rather arbitrary operations. The distinction is used most often for sets that support both binary operations, such as [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s. The multiplicative identity is often called '''unity''' in the latter context (a ring with unity). This should not be confused with a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ring theory, which is any element having a [[multiplicative inverse]]. Unity itself is necessarily a unit.\n\n==Examples==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Set !! Operation !!

In fact, every element can be a left identity. Similarly, there can be several right identities. But if there is both a right identity and a left identity, then they are equal and there is just a single two-sided identity. To see this, note that if {{mvar|l}} is a left identity and {{mvar|r}} is a right identity then {{math|1=''l'' = ''l'' \u2217 ''r'' = ''r''}}. In particular, there can never be more than one two-sided identity.  If there were two, {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|f}}, then {{math|''e'' \u2217 ''f''}} would have to be equal to both {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|f}}.\n\nIt is also quite possible for {{math|(''S'',\u2009\u2217)}} to have ''no'' identity element. A common example of this is the [[cross product]] of [[Euclidean vector|vectors]]; in this case, the absence of an identity element is related to the fact that the [[Direction (geometry)|direction]] of any nonzero cross product is always [[orthogonal]] to any element multiplied&nbsp;\u2013 so that it is not possible to obtain a non-zero vector in the same direction as the original. Another example would be the additive [[semigroup]] of [[Positive number|positive]] [[natural number]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Absorbing element]]\n* [[Additive inverse]]\n* [[Inverse element]]\n* [[Monoid]]\n* [[Pseudo-ring #Properties weaker than having an identity|Pseudo-ring]]\n* [[Quasigroup]]\n* [[Unital (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n* M.

[[singing]], although it might include some inarticulate [[vocal]]s, such as shouted [[backup vocal]]s in a [[Big Band]] setting. The word \"song\" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. The [[music]] is primarily or exclusively produced using [[musical instrument]]s. An instrumental can exist in [[music notation]], after it is written by a [[composer]]; in the mind of the [[composer]] (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a [[blues]] solo guitarist or a [[folk music]] [[fiddle]] player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a [[musical ensemble]], which could range in components from a [[duet|duo]] or [[trio (music)|trio]] to a large [[Big Band]], [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]].\n\nIn a [[song]] that is otherwise [[Singing|sung]], a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an '''instrumental interlude''', or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental [[introduction (music)|introduction]]. If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a \"solo\" (e.g., the [[guitar solo]] that is a key section of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hard rock]] songs). If the instruments are [[percussion instrument]]s, the interlude can be called a [[Break (music)|percussion interlude]] or \"percussion break\". These interludes are a form of [[Break (music)|break]] in the song.\n\nModern instrumentals are produced using a [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstation (DAW)]] such as [[FL Studio]], [[Cubase]] and [[Logic Pro]]. These pieces of software allow instrumental music to be composed with ease.\n\n==In popular music==\nIn commercial [[popular music]], instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, [[remix]]es of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A [[blues]] band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include [[electric guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[upright bass]]/[[electric bass]] and [[drum kit]].\n\n==Opposite concept==\nThe opposite of instrumental music, that is, music for voices alone, without any [[accompaniment]] instruments, is [[a cappella]], an Italian phrase that means \"in the chapel\". In [[early music]], instruments such as [[trumpet]] and [[drums]] were considered outdoor instruments, and music for inside a chapel typically used quieter instruments, voices, or just voices alone. A capella music exists in both [[Classical music]] [[choir]] pieces (for choir without any [[accompanist]] [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]]) and in popular music styles such as [[doo wop]] groups and [[Barbershop quartet]]s.

Conversely, supposing the existence of a regular icosahedron, lines defined by its six pairs of opposite vertices form an equiangular system.\n\nIn order to construct such an equiangular system, we start with this 6&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6 square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n:<math>A=\\left(\\begin{array}{crrrrr}\n0&1&1&1&1&1\\\\\n1&0&1&-1&-1&1\\\\\n1&1&0&1&-1&-1\\\\\n1&-1&1&0&1&-1\\\\\n1&-1&-1&1&0&1\\\\\n1&1&-1&-1&1&0\\end{array}\\right).</math>\n\nA straightforward computation yields {{nowrap|''A''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 5''{{math|I}}''}} (where ''{{math|I}}'' is the 6&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6 identity matrix). This implies that ''A'' has [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] \u2013{{sqrt|5}} and {{sqrt|5}}, both with multiplicity 3 since ''A'' is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and of [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] zero.\n\nThe matrix {{nowrap|''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}''}} induces thus a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean structure]] on the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] {{nowrap|{{math|\u211d}}{{sup|6}} / ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}}, which is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|\u211d}}{{sup|3}} since the [[Kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] {{nowrap|ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}} of {{nowrap|''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}''}} has [[dimension]] 3. The image under the [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] {{nowrap|{{pi}} : {{math|\u211d}}{{sup|6}} \u2192 {{math|\u211d}}{{sup|6}} / ker(''A'' + {{sqrt|5}}''{{math|I}}'')}} of the six coordinate axes {{math|\u211d}}''v''{{sub|1}}, \u2026, {{math|\u211d}}''v''{{sub|6}} in {{math|\u211d}}{{sup|6}} forms thus a system of six equiangular lines in {{math|\u211d}}{{sup|3}} intersecting pairwise at a common acute angle of arccos&nbsp;{{frac|1|{{sqrt|5}}}}.

The vertices of the regular icosahedron exist at the 5-fold rotation axis points.]]\n{{main|Icosahedral symmetry}}\nThe rotational [[symmetry group]] of the regular icosahedron is [[isomorphic]] to the [[alternating group]] on five letters. This non-[[abelian group|abelian]] [[simple group]] is the only non-trivial [[normal subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] on five letters. Since the [[Galois group]] of the general [[quintic equation]] is isomorphic to the symmetric group on five letters, and this normal subgroup is simple and non-abelian, the general quintic equation does not have a solution in radicals. The proof of the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] uses this simple fact, and [[Felix Klein]] wrote a book that made use of the theory of icosahedral symmetries to derive an analytical solution to the general quintic equation, {{Harv|Klein|1884}}. See [[Icosahedral symmetry#Related geometries|icosahedral symmetry: related geometries]] for further history, and related symmetries on seven and eleven letters.\n\nThe full symmetry group of the icosahedron (including reflections) is known as the [[full icosahedral group]], and is isomorphic to the product of the rotational symmetry group and the group ''C''<sub>2</sub> of size two, which is generated by the reflection through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n==Stellations==\nThe icosahedron has a large number of [[stellation]]s. According to specific rules defined in the book ''[[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]]'', 59 stellations were identified for the regular icosahedron. The first form is the icosahedron itself. One is a regular [[Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedron]].

These are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the same [[rotation]]s as the tetrahedron, and are somewhat analogous to the [[snub cube]] and [[snub dodecahedron]], including some forms which are [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] and some with T<sub>h</sub>-symmetry, i.e. have different planes of symmetry from the tetrahedron.\n\nThe icosahedron is unique among the [[Platonic solids]] in possessing a [[dihedral angle]] not less than 120\u00b0. Its dihedral angle is approximately 138.19\u00b0. Thus, just as hexagons have angles not less than 120\u00b0 and cannot be used as the faces of a convex regular polyhedron because such a construction would not meet the requirement that at least three faces meet at a vertex and leave a positive [[defect (geometry)|defect]] for folding in three dimensions, icosahedra cannot be used as the [[cell (geometry)|cells]] of a convex regular [[polychoron]] because, similarly, at least three cells must meet at an edge and leave a positive defect for folding in four dimensions (in general for a convex [[polytope]] in ''n'' dimensions, at least three [[facet (mathematics)|facets]] must meet at a [[peak (geometry)|peak]] and leave a positive defect for folding in ''n''-space). However, when combined with suitable cells having smaller dihedral angles, icosahedra can be used as cells in semi-regular polychora (for example the [[snub 24-cell]]), just as hexagons can be used as faces in semi-regular polyhedra (for example the [[truncated icosahedron]]). Finally, non-convex polytopes do not carry the same strict requirements as convex polytopes, and icosahedra are indeed the cells of the [[icosahedral 120-cell]], one of the ten [[Schl\u00e4fli\u2013Hess polychoron|non-convex regular polychora]].\n\nAn icosahedron can also be called a [[Gyroelongated dipyramid|gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid]]. It can be decomposed into a [[gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid]] and a [[pentagonal pyramid]] or into a [[pentagonal antiprism]] and two equal pentagonal pyramids.\n\n===Relation to the 6-cube and rhombic triacontahedron===\n:[[File:6demicube-odd-icosahedron.png|240px|left]]<br>\nIt can be projected to 3D from the 6D [[6-demicube]] using the same basis vectors that form the hull of the [[Rhombic triacontahedron]] from the [[6-cube]].

Currently only three industries are economically significant, yet all three will inevitably leave their own traces on the moor: china clay mining, farming and tourism.\n\nA good general guide to the commercial activities on Dartmoor at the end of the 19th century is [[William Crossing]]'s ''The Dartmoor Worker''.\n\n== Mining ==\n{{Main|Dartmoor tin-mining}}\n[[File:050715 101 uk dev betsy.jpg|thumb|left|The Wheal Betsy engine house]]\nIn former times, lead, silver, tin and copper were mined extensively on Dartmoor. The most obvious evidence of mining to the casual visitor to Dartmoor are the remains of the old engine-house at [[Wheal Betsy]] which is alongside the [[A386 road]] between [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] and [[Okehampton]]. The word ''Wheal'' has a particular meaning in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] being either a [[tin]] or a [[copper]] mine, however in the case of Wheal Betsy it was principally lead and silver which were mined.\n\nOnce widely practised by many miners across the moor, by the early 1900s only a few tinners remained, and mining had almost completely ceased twenty years later. Some of the more significant mines were [[Eylesbarrow mine|Eylesbarrow]], [[Knock Mine]], [[Vitifer Mine]] and [[Hexworthy Mine]]. The last active mine in the Dartmoor area was [[Great Rock Mine]], which shut down in 1969.<ref>[http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/index/learningabout/lab-exhibitions/lab-dartmoorrock/dartmoor_rock-online.htm The Uses of Dartmoor Rock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005721/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/index/learningabout/lab-exhibitions/lab-dartmoorrock/dartmoor_rock-online.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}.

The prison at [[Princetown, England|Princetown]] was built from granite taken from [[Walkhampton Common]].  When the horse tramroad from [[Plymouth]] to [[Princetown, England|Princetown]] was completed in 1823, large quantities of granite were more easily transported.\n\nThere were three major granite quarries on the moor: Haytor, Foggintor and Merrivale. The granite quarries around [[Haytor]] were the source of the stone used in several famous structures, including the [[London Bridge#New London Bridge|New London Bridge]], completed in 1831. This granite was transported from the moor via the [[Haytor Granite Tramway]], stretches of which are still visible.\n\nThe extensive quarries at Foggintor provided granite for the construction of London's [[Nelson's Column]] in the early 1840s, and [[New Scotland Yard]] was faced with granite from the quarry at Merrivale.<ref>Mercer 2009, pp.270\u2013271</ref> Merrivale Quarry continued excavating and working its own granite until the 1970s, producing gravestones and [[Roller (agricultural tool)|agricultural rollers]]. Work at Merrivale continued until the 1990s, for the last 20 years imported stone such as [[gabbro]] from Norway and Italian marble was dressed and polished.<ref>Mercer 2009, pp.271\u2013272</ref> The unusual pink granite at Great Trowlesworthy Tor was also quarried, and there were many other small granite quarries dotted around the moor. Various metamorphic rocks were also quarried in the [[metamorphic aureole]] around the edge of the moor, most notably at [[Meldon Quarry|Meldon]].<ref>Mercer 2009, p.273</ref>\n\n==Gunpowder factory==\n[[File:Powdermills incorporating mill01.jpg|thumb|left|One of the incorporating mills at Powdermills]]\nIn 1844 a factory for making gunpowder was built on the open moor, not far from [[Postbridge]]. Gunpowder was needed for the tin mines and granite quarries then in operation on the moor. The buildings were widely spaced from one another for safety and the mechanical power for grinding (\"incorporating\") the powder was derived from waterwheels driven by a [[leat]].\n\nNow known as \"Powdermills\" or \"Powder Mills\", there are extensive remains of this factory still visible. Two chimneys still stand and the walls of the two sturdily-built incorporating mills with central waterwheels survive well: they were built with substantial walls but flimsy roofs so that in the event of an explosion, the force of the blast would be directed safely upwards. The ruins of a number of ancillary buildings also survive. A proving [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]\u2014a type of small cannon used to gauge the strength of the gunpowder\u2014used by the factory still lies by the side of the road to the nearby pottery.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/powder_mills.htm\n|title=Dartmoor Powdermills\n|publisher=Legendary Dartmoor\n|accessdate=2010-08-25\n|last=Sandles\n|first=Tim}}</ref>\n\n== Peat-cutting ==\nPeat-cutting for fuel occurred at some locations on Dartmoor until certainly the 1970s, usually for personal use. The right of [[Dartmoor commoners]] to cut peat for fuel is known as ''turbary''. These rights were conferred a long time ago, pre-dating most written records. The area once known as the ''Turbary of Alberysheved'' between the [[River Teign]] and the headwaters of the [[River Bovey]] is mentioned in the Perambulation of the [[Forest of Dartmoor]] of 1240 (by 1609 the name of the area had changed to Turf Hill).\n\nAn attempt was made to commercialise the cutting of peat in 1901 at [[Rattle Brook Head]], however this quickly failed.\n\n== Warrens ==\nFrom at least the 13th century until early in the 20th, rabbits were kept on a commercial scale, both for their flesh and their fur. Documentary evidence for this exists in place names such as Trowlesworthy Warren (mentioned in a document dated 1272) and [[Warren House Inn]]. The physical evidence, in the form of [[pillow mounds]] is also plentiful, for example there are 50 pillow mounds at Legis Tor Warren.<ref>Mercer 2009, pp.296\u2013298</ref> The sophistication of the warreners is shown by the existence of vermin traps that were placed near the warrens to capture weasels and stoats attempting to get at the rabbits.\n\nThe significance of the term ''[[Warren (free)|warren]]'' nowadays is not what it once was. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was a privileged place, and the creatures of the warren were protected by the king 'for his princely delight and pleasure'.\n\nThe subject of warrening on Dartmoor was addressed in [[Eden Phillpotts]]' story ''The River''.\n\n== Farming ==\nFarming has been practised on Dartmoor since time immemorial. The [[dry-stone wall]]s which separate fields and mark boundaries give an idea of the extent to which the landscape has been shaped by farming. There is little or no arable farming within the moor, mostly being given over to livestock farming on account of the thin and rocky soil.

Indeed, {{nowrap|1=''e'' \u2022 ''e'' = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2022 ''a'' = ''a''}}.\n* In a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] (''G'', \u2022), the identity element ''e'' is the only idempotent element. Indeed, if ''x'' is an element of ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' \u2022 ''x'' = ''x''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' \u2022 ''x'' = ''x'' \u2022 ''e''}} and finally ''x'' = ''e'' by multiplying on the left by the [[inverse element]] of ''x''.\n* In the [[monoid]] ([[Natural number|\u2115]], \u00d7), idempotent elements are 0 and 1.\n* In the monoids (\ud835\udcab(''E''), \u222a) and (\ud835\udcab(''E''), \u2229) of the [[power set]] of the set ''E'' with the [[Union (set theory)|set union]] \u222a and [[Intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] \u2229 respectively, all elements are idempotent.\n* In the monoids ({0, 1}, \u2228) and ({0, 1}, \u2227) of the [[Boolean domain]] with the [[logical disjunction]] \u2228 and the  [[logical conjunction]] \u2227 respectively, all elements are idempotent.\n\n===Idempotent functions===\nIn the monoid (''F<sup>E</sup>'', \u2218) of the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from a set ''E'' to a [[subset]] ''F'' of ''E'' with the [[function composition]] \u2218, idempotent elements are the functions {{nowrap|''f'': ''E'' \u2192 ''F''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''f'' = ''f''}}, in other words such that for all ''x'' in ''E'', {{nowrap|1=''f''(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''x'')}} (the image of each element in ''E'' is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''f''). For example:\n* the [[Identity function|identity]] function is idempotent;\n* [[Constant function|constant]] functions are idempotent;\n* the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]], [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]] and [[fractional part]] functions are idempotent;\n* the [[absolute value]] function is idempotent;\n* the [[Generating set of a group|subgroup generated]] function from the power set of a group to itself is idempotent;\n* the [[convex hull]] function from the power set of an [[affine space]] over the [[Real number|reals]] to itself is idempotent;\n* the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] and [[Interior (topology)|interior]] functions of the power set of a [[topological space]] to itself are idempotent;\n* the [[Kleene star]] and [[Kleene plus]] functions of the power set of a monoid to itself are idempotent;\n* the idempotent [[endomorphism]]s of a [[vector space]] are its [[Projection (linear algebra)|projections]].\n\nIf the set ''E'' has ''n'' elements, we can partition it into ''k'' chosen fixed points and {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''k''}} non-fixed points under ''f'', and then ''k''<sup>''n''\u2212''k''</sup> is the number of different idempotent functions. Hence, taking into account all possible partitions,\n: <math>\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} k^{n-k}</math>\nis the total number of possible idempotent functions on the set. The [[integer sequence]] of the number of idempotent functions as given by the sum above for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \u2026 starts  with 1, 1, 3, 10, 41, 196, 1057, 6322, 41393, \u2026 {{OEIS|A000248}}.\n\nNeither the property of being idempotent nor that of being not is preserved under function composition.<ref>If ''f'' and ''g'' commute, i.e. if {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g'' = ''g'' \u2218 ''f''}}, then idempotency of both ''f'' and ''g'' implies that of {{nowrap|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}}, since {{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u2218 ''g'') \u2218 (''f'' \u2218 ''g'') = (''f'' \u2218 ''f'') \u2218 (''g'' \u2218 ''g'') = ''f'' \u2218 ''g''}}, using the associativity of composition.</ref> As an example for the former, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} [[modulo arithmetic|mod]] 3 and ''g''(''x'') = max(''x'', 5) are both idempotent, but {{nowrap|''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is not,<ref>e.g. ''f''(''g''(7)) = ''f''(7) = 1, but ''f''(''g''(1)) = ''f''(5) = 2 \u2260 1</ref> although {{nowrap|''g'' \u2218 ''f''}} happens to be.<ref>also showing that commutation of ''f'' and ''g'' is not a [[necessary condition]] for idempotency preservation</ref> As an example for the latter, the negation function \u00ac on the Boolean domain is not idempotent, but {{nowrap|\u00ac \u2218 \u00ac}} is. Similarly, unary negation {{nowrap|\u2212( )}} of real numbers is not idempotent, but  {{nowrap|\u2212( ) \u2218 \u2212( )}} is.\n\n== Computer science meaning ==\n{{See also|Referential transparency (computer science)|Reentrant (subroutine)|Stable sort}}\nIn [[computer science]], the term ''idempotence'' may have a different meaning depending on the context in which it is applied:\n* in [[imperative programming]], a [[subroutine]] with [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]] is idempotent if the system state remains the same after one or several calls, in other words if the function from the system state space to itself associated to the subroutine is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]];\n* in [[functional programming]], a [[pure function]] is idempotent if it is idempotent in the mathematical sense given in the [[#Definition|definition]].\n\nThis is a very useful property in many situations, as it means that an operation can be repeated or retried as often as necessary without causing unintended effects. With non-idempotent operations, the algorithm may have to keep track of whether the operation was already performed or not.\n\n=== Examples ===\nA function looking up a customer's name and address in a [[database]] is typically idempotent, since this will not cause the database to change.  Similarly, changing a customer's address is typically idempotent, because the final address will be the same no matter how many times it is submitted. However, placing an order for a car for the customer is typically not idempotent, since running the call several times will lead to several orders being placed. Canceling an order is idempotent, because the order remains canceled no matter how many requests are made.\n\nA composition of idempotent methods or subroutines, however, is not necessarily idempotent if a later method in the sequence changes a value that an earlier method depends on \u2013 ''idempotence is not closed under composition''.  For example, suppose the initial value of a variable is 3 and there is a sequence that reads the variable, then changes it to 5, and then reads it again.  Each step in the sequence is idempotent: both steps reading the variable have no side effects and changing a variable to 5 will always have the same effect no matter how many times it is executed.  Nonetheless, executing the entire sequence once produces the output (3, 5), but executing it a second time produces the output (5, 5), so the sequence is not idempotent.<!-- {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} please discuss this on talk page before reinstating -->\n\nIn the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), idempotence and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Safe methods|safety]] are the major attributes that separate [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|HTTP verbs]].  Of the major HTTP verbs, GET, PUT, and DELETE should be implemented in an idempotent manner according to the standard, but POST need not be.<ref name=\"httpStd-methods\">IETF, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608213403/http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 |date=2014-06-08 }}.  See also [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HyperText Transfer Protocol]].</ref>  GET retrieves a resource; PUT stores content at a resource; and DELETE eliminates a resource.  As in the example above, reading data usually has no side effects, so it is idempotent (in fact [[wiktionary:nullipotent|''nullipotent'']]).  Storing and deleting a given set of content are each usually idempotent as long as the request specifies a location or identifier that uniquely identifies that resource and only that resource again in the future.  The PUT and DELETE operations with unique identifiers reduce to the simple case of assignment to an immutable variable of either a value or the null-value, respectively, and are idempotent for the same reason; the end result is always the same as the result of the initial execution, even if the response differs.<ref>{{cite IETF|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |section=4.2.2 |sectionname=Idempotent Methods |quote=It knows that repeating the request will have the same intended effect, even if the original request succeeded, though the response might differ.}}</ref>\n\nViolation of the unique identification requirement in storage or deletion typically causes violation of idempotence.  For example, storing or deleting a given set of content without specifying a unique identifier: POST requests, which do not need to be idempotent, often do not contain unique identifiers, so the creation of the identifier is delegated to the receiving system which then creates a corresponding new record.  Similarly, PUT and DELETE requests with nonspecific criteria may result in different outcomes depending on the state of the system - for example, a request to delete the most recent record. In each case, subsequent executions will further modify the state of the system, so they are not idempotent. \n\nIn [[Event stream processing]], idempotence refers to the ability of a system to produce the same outcome, even if the same file, event or message is received more than once.\n\nIn a [[load-store architecture]], instructions that might possibly cause a [[page fault]] are idempotent. So if a page fault occurs, the OS can load the page from disk and then simply re-execute the faulted instruction.  In a processor where such instructions are not idempotent, dealing with page faults is much more complex.{{fact|date=August 2016}}\n\nWhen reformatting output, [[Prettyprint|pretty-printing]] is expected to be idempotent. In other words, if the output is already \"pretty\", there should be nothing to do for the pretty-printer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Applied examples ==\n[[File:Colecci\u00f3n de hombres cruzando.JPG|thumb|A typical crosswalk button is an example of an idempotent system]]\nApplied examples that many people could encounter in their day-to-day lives include [[elevator]] call buttons and [[crosswalk button]]s.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110523081716/http://www.nclabor.com/elevator/geartrac.pdf  For example, this design specification includes detailed algorithm for when elevator cars will respond to subsequent calls for service</ref> The initial activation of the button moves the system into a requesting state, until the request is satisfied. Subsequent activations of the button between the initial activation and the request being satisfied have no effect, unless the system is designed to adjust the time for satisfying the request based on the number of activations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Closure operator]]\n* [[Fixed point (mathematics)]]\n* [[Idempotent of a code]]\n* [[Nilpotent]]\n* [[Idempotent matrix]]\n* [[Idempotent relation]] &mdash; a generalization of idempotence to binary relations\n* [[List of matrices]]\n* [[Pure function]]\n* [[Referential transparency]]\n* [[Iterated function]]\n* [[Biordered set]]\n* [[Involution (mathematics)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wikibooks}}\n{{wikiversity | Portal:Computer Science}}\n* \u201c[http://foldoc.org/idempotent idempotent]\u201d at [[FOLDOC]]\n*{{citation\n |author=Goodearl, K.

At the time of European contact, this area was controlled by the [[Cayuga tribe|Cayuga Indians]], one of the powerful Five Nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' or  [[Iroquois League]]. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] from [[New France]] (Quebec) are said to have had a mission to the Cayuga as early as 1657.<ref name=first>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tk5IAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=History+of+Ithaca,+New+York&source=bl&ots=FuTnYTwg5A&sig=CcTsxjRJx_M7qjlqb8Qo7Nq8ulY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBDgoahUKEwi12uykj6DHAhUImIAKHfIvABo#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20Ithaca%2C%20New%20York&f=false ''History of the First Presbyterian Church of Ithaca'', Andrus & Church, 1904]</ref>\n\n[[Saponi]] and [[Tutelo]] Indians, Algonquian-speaking tribes, later occupied lands at the south end of [[Cayuga Lake]]. Dependent tributaries of the Cayuga, they had been permitted to settle on the tribe's hunting lands at the south end of Cayuga Lake, as well as in Pony (originally Sapony) Hollow of what is known as present-day [[Newfield, New York]]. Remnants of these tribes had been forced from [[North Carolina]] by tribal conflicts and European colonial encroachment.<ref name=first /> Similarly, the [[Tuscarora people]], an Iroquoian-speaking tribe from the Carolinas, migrated after defeat in the [[Yamasee War]]; they settled with the [[Oneida people]] and became the sixth nation of the Haudenosaunee, with chiefs stating the migration was complete in 1722.\n\n[[File:Ithaca, N.Y. LOC 95685698.tif|thumb|[[Perspective map]] of Ithaca and published in 1882]]\nDuring the Revolutionary War, four of the then six Iroquois nations were allied with the British, although bands made decisions on fighting in a highly decentralized way. Conflict with the rebel colonists was fierce throughout the Mohawk Valley and western New York. In retaliation for conflicts to the east, the 1779 [[Sullivan Expedition]] was conducted against the Iroquois peoples in the west of the state, destroying more than 40 villages and stored winter crops.<ref name=dhs>\"Ithaca: History\", The DeWitt Historical Society of Tompkins County Library & Archive</ref> It destroyed the Tutelo village of Coregonal, located near what is now the junction of state routes [[New York State Highway 13|13]] and [[New York State Route 13A|13A]] just south of the Ithaca city limits. Most Iroquois were forced from the state after the Revolutionary War, but some remnants remained. The state sold off the former Iroquois lands to stimulate development and settlement by European Americans; lands were also granted as payment to veterans of the war.\n\nWithin the current boundaries of the City of Ithaca, Native Americans maintained only a temporary hunting camp at the base of Cascadilla Gorge. In 1788, eleven men from [[Kingston, New York]] came to the area with two [[Delaware people]] (Lenape) guides, to explore what they considered wilderness. The following year Jacob Yaple, Isaac Dumond, and Peter Hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins.<ref name=first /> That same year Abraham Bloodgood of Albany obtained a patent from the state for 1,400 acres, which included all of the present downtown west of Tioga Street.<ref name=Daniel>[http://tcpl.org/local-history/documents/ithaca-tc/Ithaca_and_its_Past/001to48.pdf Snodderly, Daniel R., \"Ithaca and its Past\", DeWitt Historical Society of Tompkins County, 1982]</ref> In 1790, the federal government and state began an official program to grant land in the area, known as the [[Central New York Military Tract]], as payment for service to the American soldiers of the Revolutionary War, as the government was cash poor. Most local land titles trace back to these Revolutionary war grants.\n\n=== Partition of the Military Tract ===\nAs part of this process, the [[Central New York Military Tract]], which included northern Tompkins County, was surveyed by [[Simeon De Witt]], Bloodgood's son-in-law. De Witt was also the nephew of Governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. The Commissioners of Lands of New York State (chairman Gov. George Clinton) met in 1790. The Military Tract township in which proto-Ithaca was located was named the [[Ulysses, New York|Town of Ulysses]]. A few years later De Witt moved to Ithaca, then called variously \"The Flats,\" \"The City,\" or \"Sodom\";<ref name=facts /> he renamed it for the Greek island home of Ulysses in the spirit of the multitude of settlement names in the region derived from [[classical literature]], such as [[Aurelius, New York|Aurelius]], [[Ovid, New York|Ovid]], and especially of [[Ulysses, New York]], the town that contained Ithaca at the time.<ref name=dhs />\n\nAround 1791 De Witt surveyed what is now the downtown area into lots and sold them at modest prices. That same year John Yaple built a grist mill on Cascadilla Creek. The first frame house was erected in 1800 by Abram Markle.<ref name=first /> In 1804 the village had a postmaster, and in 1805 a tavern.<ref name=Kammen>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cU0kI2ShQa8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ithaca,+New+York&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAGoVChMIyNGBi6WgxwIVxY8-Ch2CoQLR#v=onepage&q=Ithaca%2C%20New%20York&f=false Kammen, Carol. ''Ithaca: A Brief History'', The History Press, 2011] {{ISBN|9781614230670}}</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\nIthaca became a transshipping point for salt from curing beds near [[Salina, New York]] to buyers south and east. This prompted construction in 1810 of the Owego Turnpike.<ref name=Kammen /> When the [[War of 1812]] cut off access to Nova Scotia [[gypsum]], used for fertilizer, Ithaca became the center of trade in Cayuga gypsum.<ref name=Daniel /> The Cayuga Steamboat Company was organized in 1819 and in 1820 launched the first [[steamboat]] on Cayuga Lake, the ''Enterprise.''<ref name=Daniel /> In 1821, the village was incorporated at the same time the Town of Ithaca was organized and separated from the parent Town of Ulysses. In 1834, the [[Ithaca and Owego Railroad]]'s first horse-drawn train began service,<ref name=dhs /> connecting traffic on the east-west [[Erie Canal]] (completed in 1825) with the [[Susquehanna River]] to the south to expand the trade network.\n\nWith the depression of 1837, the railroad was re-organized as the Cayuga & Susquehanna. It was re-engineered with switchbacks in the late 1840s; in the late 20th century a short section of this route in the city and town of Ithaca was used for the [[Trails in Ithaca, New York#South Hill Recreation Way|South Hill Recreation Way]].\n\nHowever, easier railroad routes were constructed, such as that of the Syracuse, Binghamton & New York (1854). In the decade following the Civil War, railroads were built from Ithaca to surrounding points ([[Geneva, New York|Geneva]]; [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]]; [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]]; and [[Elmira, New York]]; and [[Athens, Pennsylvania]]), mainly with financing from [[Ezra Cornell]]. The geography of the city, on a steep hill by the lake, has prevented it from being directly connected to a major transportation artery.  When the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] built its main line from Pennsylvania to [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1890, it bypassed Ithaca (running via eastern [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler County]] on easier grades), as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] had done in the 1850s.\n\n[[File:Ithaca-guns 1916 a-oakley.jpg|thumb|150px|Ithaca Gun Co. - Annie Oakley gun, 1916]]\nIn the late 19th century, more industry developed in Ithaca. In 1883 William Henry Baker and his partners started the [[Ithaca Gun Company]], making shotguns. The original factory was located in the Fall Creek neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as Gun Hill, where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. The company became an icon in the hunting and shooting world, its shotguns famous for their fine decorative work. Wooden gunstocks with knots or other imperfections were donated to the high school woodworking shop to be made into lamps.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Kirk |date=15 October 2000 |title=Ithaca Journal: Sweet Fishing and a Gorgeous Gorge, if You Don't Mind All That Old Lead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/nyregion/ithaca-journal-sweet-fishing-gorgeous-gorge-if-you-don-t-mind-all-that-old-lead.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2016-03-02}}</ref> [[John Philip Sousa]] and trick-shooter [[Annie Oakley]] favored Ithaca guns. In 1937 the company began producing the Ithaca 37, based on a 1915 patent by noted firearms designer [[John Browning]].

Ithaca is at the southern end (the \"head\") of the lake, but the valley continues to the southwest behind the city. Originally a river valley, it was deepened and widened by the action of Pleistocene ice sheets over the last several hundred thousand years. The lake, which drains to the north, formed behind a dam of glacial [[moraine]]. The rock is predominantly [[Devonian]] and, north of Ithaca, is relatively fossil rich. [[Glacial erratic]]s can be found in the area. The world-renowned fossils found in this area can be examined at the [[Museum of the Earth]].\n\nIthaca was founded on flat land just south of the lake\u2014land that formed in fairly recent geological times when silt filled the southern end of the lake. The city ultimately spread to the adjacent hillsides, which rise several hundred feet above the central flats:  East Hill, West Hill, and South Hill. Its sides are fairly steep, and a number of the streams that flow into the valley from east or west have cut deep canyons, usually with several [[waterfall]]s.\n\nThe natural vegetation of the Ithaca area, seen in areas unbuilt and unfarmed, is northern [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]], dominated by [[deciduous plant|deciduous trees]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Climate chart\n| Ithaca\n|15.7|31.6|2.01\n|15.2|32.5|1.94\n|24.0|41.7|2.62\n|34.7|54.8|2.89\n|44.6|67.1|3.33\n|53.8|76.2|3.64\n|58.4|80.9|3.61\n|56.7|78.9|3.50\n|50.1|71.8|3.41\n|40.0|60.0|3.12\n|31.8|47.2|2.65\n|21.0|35.3|2.41\n|units = imperial\n|float = right\n|clear = }}\nIthaca experiences a moderate [[continental climate]].

In 2011 there were about 21,000 students enrolled at Cornell and about 6,400 at Ithaca College.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000172.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cornell University : Enrollments by College : Ithaca Campus \u2013 Fall 2011 |publisher=Dpb.cornell.edu |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> [[Tompkins Cortland Community College]] is located in the neighboring Town of [[Dryden (town), New York|Dryden]], and has an extension center in downtown Ithaca. [[Empire State College]] offers non-traditional college courses to adults in downtown Ithaca.\n\nThe public school system is based in Ithaca. The [[Ithaca City School District]], which encompasses Ithaca and the surrounding area, enrolls about 5,500 K-12 students in eight elementary schools, two middle schools, [[Ithaca High School (Ithaca, New York)|Ithaca High School]], and the [[Lehman Alternative Community School]]. Several private elementary and secondary schools are located in the Ithaca area, including the Roman Catholic Immaculate Conception School, the [[Cascadilla School]], the New Roots Charter School, the Elizabeth Ann Clune Montessori School, and the Ithaca [[Waldorf School]]. Ithaca has two networks for supporting its home-schooling families: Loving Education At Home (LEAH) and the Northern Light Learning Center (NLLC).\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Cayuga Steet, Ithaca, NY.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cayuga Street at Green Street in downtown Ithaca]]\nThe economy of Ithaca is based on education, with technology and tourism in supporting roles. As of 2006, Ithaca has continued to have one of the few expanding economies in New York State outside New York City. It draws commuters for work from the neighboring rural counties of [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]], and [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]], as well as from the more urbanized [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung County]].\n\nIthaca has tried to maintain its traditional downtown shopping area with its pedestrian orientation; this includes the [[Ithaca Commons]] pedestrian mall and Center Ithaca, a small mixed-use complex built at the end of the urban renewal era. Another commercial center, Collegetown, is located next to the Cornell campus. It features a number of restaurants, shops, and bars, and an increasing number of high-rise apartments. It is primarily frequented by Cornell University students.\n\nIthaca has many of the businesses characteristic of small American university towns: bookstores, art house cinemas, craft stores, and vegetarian-friendly restaurants. The collective [[Moosewood Restaurant]], founded in 1973, published a number of vegetarian cookbooks.<ref name=facts /> ''[[Bon Appetit]]'' magazine ranked it among the thirteen most influential restaurants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Ithaca has many local restaurants and chains both in the city and town with a range of ethnic foods. It has become a destination and residence for retirees.\n\nThe Ithaca Farmers Market, a cooperative with 150 vendors who live within 30 miles of Ithaca, first opened for business on Saturdays in 1973. It is located at Steamboat Landing, where steamboats from Cayuga Lake used to dock.<ref>[http://www.ithacamarket.com/about-us/history/ \"History\", Ithaca Farmers' Market]</ref>\n\nThe South Hills Business Campus originally opened in 1957 as the regional headquarters of the [[National Cash Register]] Company. Running three full factory shifts, NCR was a major employer. Although it was sold in 1991 to [[American Telephone and Telegraph]] and later acquired by Cognitive TPG, TPG remains a major tenant of the South Hill Business Campus, which is now owned by a group of private investors.<ref>[http://southhillbusinesscampus.com/southhill/history.html Heffner, Mary C., \"History of the South Hill Business Campus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927201925/http://southhillbusinesscampus.com/southhill/history.html |date=2015-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\nThe ''[[Ithaca Journal]]'', founded in 1815, is a morning daily newspaper owned by [[Gannett]].

For its initial 84 years, the series featured Western classical artists exclusively. In 1987, however, the series broke with tradition to present Ravi Shankar and has since grown to encompass a broader spectrum of the world\u2019s great musics. Now, it balances of a mix of Western classical music, traditions from around the world, jazz, and new musics in these genres.

[[Old-time music]] is a staple and folk music is featured weekly on [[WVBR-FM]]'s ''Bound for Glory'', North America's longest-running live folk concert broadcast. The [[Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance]], hosted by local band [[Donna the Buffalo]], is held annually during the third week in July in the nearby village of [[Trumansburg, New York|Trumansburg]], with more than 60 local, national and international acts.\n\nIthaca is the center of a thriving live music scene, featuring over 200 groups playing most genres of American popular music, the predominant genres being Folk, Rock, Blues, Jazz, and Country.<ref>[http://ithacamusic.net/org.php?c=venue Musicians \u2013 Ithaca Music Scene]</ref> There are over 80 live music venues within a 40-mile radius of the city, including cafes, pubs, clubs, and concert halls.<ref>[http://ithacamusic.net/org.php?c=venue Venues \u2013 Ithaca Music Scene]</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nIn 2009, the Ithaca metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who walked to work (15.1 percent).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|series=American Community Survey Reports|title=Commuting in the United States: 2009|access-date=December 9, 2017|date=September 2011}}</ref> In 2013, the Ithaca MSA ranked as the second lowest in the United States for percentage of commuters who traveled by private vehicle (68.7 percent).

[[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], and [[Ottawa]] are about four hours away.\n\nIthaca lies at over a half hour's drive from any [[interstate highway]], and all car trips to Ithaca involve some driving on two-lane state rural highways.  The city is at the convergence of many regional two-lane state highways: Routes [[New York State Route 13|13]], [[New York State Route 13A|13A]], [[New York State Route 34|34]], [[New York State Route 79|79]], [[New York State Route 89|89]], [[New York State Route 96|96]], [[New York State Route 96B|96B]], and [[New York State Route 366|366]]. These are usually not congested except in Ithaca proper. However, Route 79 between the I-81 access at Whitney Point and Ithaca receives a significant amount of Ithaca-bound congestion right before Ithaca's colleges reopen after breaks.\n\nIn July 2008, a non-profit called Ithaca Carshare began a [[carsharing]] service in Ithaca. Ithaca Carshare has a fleet of vehicles shared by over 1500 members as of July 2015 and has become a popular service among both city residents and the college communities. Vehicles are located throughout Ithaca downtown and the two major institutions. With Ithaca Carshare as the first locally run carsharing organization in New York State, others have since launched in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], Albany, NY, and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].\n\nRideshare services to promote carpooling and vanpooling are operated by ZIMRIDE and VRIDE. A community mobility education program, Way2Go is operated by Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County.  Way2Go's website provides consumer information and videos.

Together, 2-1-1 Information and Referral and Way2Go are a one-call, one-click resource designed to mobility services information for Ithaca and throughout Tompkins County.\n\nAs a growing urban area, Ithaca is facing steady increases in levels of vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend for the health of downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing [[urban density]] in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.\n\n=== Bus ===\nIn 2017, [[OurBus]] launched a bus route between Ithaca and Manhattan, offering daily departures. There is frequent intercity bus service by [[Greyhound Lines]], New York Trailways, and Shortline (Coach USA), particularly to Binghamton and New York City, with limited service to Rochester, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and Syracuse, and (via connections in Binghamton) to Utica and Albany. The Greyhound bus station<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greyhound.com/en/locations/terminal.aspx?city=150898 |title=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Greyhound.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}</ref> is the former [[Delaware, Lackawanna & Western]] railway station on Meadow Street between West State and West Seneca streets, a little over half a mile west of downtown Ithaca. Cornell University runs a premium campus to campus bus between its Ithaca campus and its medical school in [[Manhattan, New York City]] which is open to the public.\n\nIthaca is the center of an extensive bus public transportation network. TCAT, Inc ([[Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit]], Inc.) is a not-for-profit corporation that provides public transportation for Tompkins County New York. TCAT was reorganized as a non-profit corporation in 2004 and is primarily supported locally by Cornell University, the City of Ithaca and Tompkins County. TCAT's ridership increased from 2.7 million in 2004 to 4.4 million in 2013. https://web.archive.org/web/20141027015210/http://www.tcatbus.com/files/all/tcat_2013_yearbook_-_final.pdf TCAT operates 33 routes, many running seven days a week.  It has frequent service to downtown, Cornell, Ithaca College, and the Shops at Ithaca Mall in the neighboring Town of Lansing, but less frequent service to many residential and rural areas, including Trumansburg and Newfield. [[Chemung County Transit (C-TRAN)]] runs weekday commuter service from Chemung County to Ithaca. Cortland Transit runs commuter service to Cornell University. Tioga County Public Transit operates three routes to Ithaca and Cornell, but will cease operating on November 30, 2014.\n\nGADABOUT Transportation Services, Inc. provides demand-response paratransit service for seniors over 60 and people with disabilities. Ithaca Dispatch provides local and regional taxi service. In addition, Ithaca Airline Limousine and IthaCar Service connect to the local airports.\n\n=== Airports ===\n[[File:Pinnacle Airlines CRJ-200 N823AY KDCA.JPG|left|thumb|Delta Connection Bombardier CRJ-200]]\n\nIthaca is served by [[Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport]], located about three miles to the northeast of the city center. [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] offers flights to its hub at [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], operated by [[Piedmont Airlines]] using [[Embraer ERJ-145]] airliners. [[Delta Connection]] provides service to its hub at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metro]] airport, operated by [[SkyWest Airlines]] using [[Bombardier CRJ-200]] airliners. [[United Express]] offers three daily flights to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], operated by [[CommutAir]] using [[Embraer ERJ-145]]. Some residents choose to travel to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]], [[Greater Binghamton Airport]], [[Elmira-Corning Regional Airport]] or [[Greater Rochester International Airport]] for more airline service options.\n\n=== Railways ===\n[[File:NS 8921 GE C40-9W.jpg|right|thumb|A Norfolk Southern locomotive]]\n\n[[Norfolk Southern]] freight trains reach Ithaca from [[Sayre, Pennsylvania]], mainly to deliver coal to [[AES Corporation|AES]] Cayuga, a coal power plant (known as Milliken Station during NYSEG ownership) and haul out salt from the Cargill salt mine, both on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. There is no passenger rail service, although from the 1870s through the 1950s there were trains to Buffalo via [[Geneva, New York]]; to New York City via [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] ([[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]) and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] ([[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|DL&W]]);  to [[Auburn, New York]]; and to the [[Northeastern United States|US northeast]] via [[Cortland, New York]]; service to Buffalo and New York City lasted until 1961.<ref>Lee, Hardy Campbell (2008) (2nd ed.; first ed. 1977) ''A History of Railroads in Tompkins County''.

Penn considered its founding date to be 1749 for over a century.[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/trustees.html]  In 1895, elite universities in the United States agreed that henceforth formal [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates.  Penn's periodical \"The Alumni Register,\" published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group which had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the \"New Building\" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence \"Unnamed Charity School\" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php]  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> \n|[[Nonsectarian]],<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: \"The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html]. Jencks and Riesman (2001) write \"The Anglicans who founded the University of Pennsylvania, however, were evidently anxious not to alienate Philadelphia's Quakers, and they made their new college officially nonsectarian.\"  In Franklin's 1749 founding [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/1749proposals.html Proposals relating to the education of youth in Pensilvania] [http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=franklin_youth&PagePosition=20 (page images)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018223123/http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=franklin_youth&PagePosition=20 |date=2007-10-18 }}, religion is not mentioned directly as a subject of study, but he states in a footnote that the study of \"''History'' will also afford frequent Opportunities of showing the Necessity of a ''Publick Religion,'' from its Usefulness to the Publicks; the Advantage of a Religious Character among private Persons; the Mischiefs of Superstition, &c. and the Excellency of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION above all others antient or modern.\" Starting in 1751, the same trustees also operated a Charity School for Boys, whose curriculum combined \"general principles of Christianity\" with practical instruction leading toward careers in business and the \"mechanical arts.\" [http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/charitysch.html], and thus might be described as \"non-denominational Christian.\" The charity school was originally planned and a trust was organized on paper in 1740 by followers of travelling evangelist [[George Whitefield]].  The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labelled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"{{cite web|url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodists]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473\u2013475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|Princeton University\n|1746 as ''College of New Jersey''\n|Nonsectarian,<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\"/> founded by [[Calvinist]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/english/Stop05.htm|title=University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>\n|-\n|Columbia University\n|1754 as ''King's College''\n|[[Church of England]]\n|-\n|Brown University\n|1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''\n|[[Baptist]], founding charter promises \"no religious tests\" and \"full liberty of conscience\"<ref>Brown's website characterizes it as \"the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia,\" but adds that at the time it was \"the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions.\"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] Brown's charter stated that \"into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.\" The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be \"five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians.\"[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PRE_PYR/PROVIDENCE.html]</ref>\n|-\n|Dartmouth College\n|1769\n|[[Calvinist]] (Congregationalist)\n|-\n|Cornell University\n|1865\n|Nonsectarian\n|}\n\n:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.  Harvard University uses the date that the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally allocated funds for the creation of a college.  Harvard was chartered in 1650, although classes had been conducted for approximately a decade by then.  The University of Pennsylvania initially considered its founding date to be 1750; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Hughes| first=Samuel| year=2002|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html| title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history| journal=Pennsylvania Gazette| volume=100| issue=3}}</ref> Later in Penn's early history, the university changed its officially recognized founding date to 1749, which was used for all of the nineteenth century, including a centennial celebration in 1849.  In 1899, Penn's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740, in response to a petition from Penn's General Alumni Society.  Penn was chartered in 1755, the same year collegiate classes began.  \"Religious affiliation\" refers to financial sponsorship, formal association with, and promotion by, a religious denomination.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\n\nA common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \"IV League\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the \"IV League\" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the \"IV League\" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n\n===Pre\u2013Ivy League===\n[[Image:Chancellor Green exterior Princeton.JPG|thumb|right|Chancellor Green Library at Princeton, 2007]]\n[[File:Brown university robinson hall 2009a.JPG|thumb|right|Robinson Hall at Brown, 2009]]\n[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Cornell baseball player, 1908]]\n\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of [[The College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].\n\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (US politician)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archivedate=2010-09-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \"full liberty of conscience\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\n\n\"Ivy League\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first = Joseph |last = Epstein | year=2003 |publisher = Houghton Mifflin | isbn = 0-618-34073-4}} p. 55, \"by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them.\"</ref> Novels<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin}} p. 179, \"he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 \"''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption....

They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>\n\n===History of the athletic league===\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|Yale University's four-oared crew team, posing with the 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy.]]\n[[File:The 1879 Brown University Baseball Team.jpg|thumb|The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with [[William Edward White|W.E.

The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870\u20131894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\n\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\n\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\n\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = 2014-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = 2014-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\n\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\". The earliest reference to the \"Ivy colleges\" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/>  In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called \"Ivy League\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\n\n{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years\u2014and markedly in the last three months\u2014there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\n\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \"Ivy League\".

Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].\nThe proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Post\u2013World War II====\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Tuck School of Business.JPG|thumb|Students in Stell Hall at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], 2007]]\n[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]\n\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships.

This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own.

The governing body of the Ivy League is the Council of Ivy Group Presidents, composed of each university president. During meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives for the universities.\n\nThe universities also collaborate academically through the IvyPlus Exchange program, which allows students to cross-register at one of the Ivies or one of the eligible schools, which include the University of California at Berkeley, University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exchange Scholar Program (IvyPlus Exchange) |url=https://gsas.yale.edu/academics/exchanges/exchange-scholar-program-ivyplus-exchange |website=Yale University}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Fashion and lifestyle===\n{{See also|Ivy League (clothes)|Preppy|Take Ivy|Ivy League (haircut)}}\n[[File:Architecture on University of Pennsylvania Campus - Young Ben Franklin Statue - Philadelphia - Pennsylvania - 04.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]] on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, 2011]]\n\nDifferent fashion trends and styles have emerged from Ivy League campuses over time, and fashion trends such as [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League]] and [[Preppy]] are styles often associated with the Ivy League and its culture.\n\n[[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League style]] is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s, believed to have originated on Ivy League campuses. The clothing stores [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] represent perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner. The Ivy League style is said to be the predecessor to the [[preppy]] style of dress.\n\nPreppy fashion started around 1912 to the late 1940s and 1950s as the Ivy League style of dress.<ref>{{cite book | title =Elements of Fashion and Apparel Design | publisher = New Age Publishers | isbn = 81-224-1371-4 |page=25 |quote=Ivy League: A popular look for men in the fifties that originated on such campuses as Harvard, Priceton {{sic}} and Yale; a forerunner to the preppie look; a style characterized by button down collar shirts and pants with a small buckle in the back.}}</ref> [[J.

This can be seen in sport stripes and colours, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets and nautical-themed accessories.

In one sport, [[College rowing (United States)|rowing]], the Ivies recognize team champions for each sex in both heavyweight and lightweight divisions.

Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

However, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since 1956 due to the league's concerns about the extended December schedule's effects on academics.  For this reason, any Ivy League team invited to the FCS playoffs turns down the bid.  The Ivy League plays a strict 10-game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 (or, in some seasons, 12) regular season games, plus post-season, which was most recently expanded in [[2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2013]] to five rounds with 24 teams, with a bye week for the top eight teams.  Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.\n\nIn addition to varsity football, Penn, Princeton and Cornell also field teams in the eight-team [[Sprint football|Collegiate Sprint Football League]], in which all players must weigh 172 pounds or less. Penn and Princeton are the last remaining founding members of the league from its 1934 debut, and Cornell is the next-oldest, joining in 1937.

First has been the founder, Paul Glover, moving out of town.  While in Ithaca, Glover had acted as an evangelist and networker for HOURS, helping spread their use and helping businesses find ways to spend HOURS they had received.  Secondly, a general shift away from cash transactions towards electronic transfers with debit or credit cards.  Glover has emphasized that every local currency needs at least one full-time networker to \"promote, facilitate and troubleshoot\" currency circulation.\n\n==Origin==\nIthaca HOURS were started by [[Paul Glover (activist)|Paul Glover]] in November 1991 as an alternative means to pay for [[Combos]].<ref name=\"nytimes91\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/nyregion/ithaca-journal-an-alternative-to-cash-beyond-banks-or-barter.html |title=\"ITHACA JOURNAL; An Alternative to Cash, Beyond Banks or Barter\", '&#39;New York Times'&#39;, May 31, 1993 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1993-05-31 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>  The system has historical roots in [[scrip]] and alternative and local currencies that proliferated in America during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"nytimes91\" />\n\nWhile doing research into local economics during 1989, Glover had seen an \"Hour\" note 19th century British industrialist [[Robert Owen]] issued to his workers for spending at his company store.  After Ithaca HOURS began, he discovered that Owen's Hours were based on [[Josiah Warren]]'s \"[[Cincinnati Time Store|Time Store]]\" notes of 1827.\n\nIn May 1991, local student [[Patrice Jennings]] interviewed Glover about the Ithaca [[LETS]] enterprise.  This conversation strongly reinforced his interest in trade systems.  Jennings's research on the Ithaca LETS and its failure was integral to the development of the HOUR currency; conversations between Jennings and Glover helped ensure that HOURS used knowledge of what had not worked with the LETS system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pDHdpj0UysC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22patrice+jennings%22+%22paul+glover%22&source=bl&ots=TYRRZ9K_eB&sig=huDo3ZwBdw6qBQyFwiNLzRqotTA&hl=en&ei=DIYVSoWSOZCm8gSCtaTHAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA47,M1 |title=Bill Maurer, '&#39;Mutual life, limited: Islamic banking, alternative currencies, lateral reason'&#39;, Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 47 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1986-06-26 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few days, he had designs for the HOUR and Half HOUR notes. He established that each HOUR would be worth the equivalent of $10, which was about the average hourly amount that workers earned in surrounding [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]],<ref name=\"nieves\">{{cite news|last=Nieves |first=Evelyn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/our-towns-ithaca-hours-pocket-money-for-everyman.html |title=Evelyn Nieves, \"Our Towns;Ithaca Hours: Pocket Money For Everyman\", '&#39;New York Times'&#39;, Jan. 21, 1996 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-01-21 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> although the exact rate of exchange for any given transaction was to be decided by the parties themselves.  At [[GreenStar Cooperative Market]], a local food co-op, Glover approached Gary Fine, a local massage therapist, with photocopied samples.  Fine became the first person to sign a list formally agreeing to accept HOURS in exchange for services.  Soon after, Jim Rohrrsen, the proprietor of a local toy store, became the first retailer to sign-up to accept Ithaca HOURS in exchange for merchandise.\n\nWhen the system was first started, 90 people agreed to accept HOURS as pay for their services.<ref name=\"nieves\" />  They all agreed to accept HOURS despite the lack of a business plan or guarantee. Glover then began to ask for small donations to help pay for printing HOURS.\n\nFine Line Printing completed the first run of 1,500 HOURS and 1,500 Half HOURS in October 1991.  These notes, the first modern local currency, were nearly twice as large as the current Ithaca HOURS.  Because they didn't fit well in people's wallets, almost all of the original notes have been removed from circulation.\n\nThe first issue of Ithaca Money was printed at [[Our Press]], a printing shop in [[Chenango Bridge]], New York, on October 16, 1991. The next day Glover issued 10 HOURS to Ithaca Hours, the organization he founded to run the system, as the first of four reimbursements for the cost of printing HOURS.  The day after that, October 18, 1991, 382 HOURS were disbursed and prepared for mailing to the first 93 pioneers.\n\nOn October 19, 1991, Glover bought a [[samosa]] from Catherine Martinez at the Farmers' Market with Half HOUR #751\u2014the first use of an HOUR. Several other Market vendors enrolled that day. During the next years more than a thousand individuals enrolled to accept HOURS, plus 500 businesses.\n\nStacks of the Ithaca Money newspaper were distributed all over town with an invitation to \"join the fun.\"\n\nA [[Barter Potluck]] was held at [[Greater Ithaca Activities Center|GIAC]] on November 12, 1991, the first of many monthly gatherings where food and skills were exchanged, acquaintances made, and friendships renewed.\n\n==Management & philosophy ==\nIn 1996, Glover was running the Ithaca Hours system from his home, and the system had an advisory board and a governing board called the \"Barter Potluck\".<ref name=\"nieves\" /> The board and Glover put forth the idea that economic interactions should be based on harmony rather than on more Hobbsian forms of competition. In one interview, Glover stated that \"There's a growing movement called \"ecological economics\" and Ithaca HOURS is part of that cosmos. Last year I wrote an article which  discusses moving us toward the provision of food, fuel, clothing, housing, transportation, [and other] necessities in ways which are  healing of nature, or which are less depleting at least and which bring people together on the basis of their shared pride, not arrogance.\" Thus one underlying principle of the local currency movement is to create \"fair trade\" with a minimum of conflict or exploitation of either people or natural resources.<ref>Fortier, Jana \"[https://www.academia.edu/2307226/Underthrowing_the_System_How_Low_Finance_Undermines_Corporate_Culture Underthrowing the System: How Low Finance Undermines Corporate Culture]\" ''Conscious Choice: Journal of Ecology and Healthy Living'' Sept/Oct 1996.''''</ref>\n\nThe Advisory Board incorporated the Ithaca HOUR system as Ithaca Hours, Inc. in October 1998, and hosted the first elections for Board of Directors in March 1999.  The first Board of Directors included Monica Hargraves, Dan Cogan, Margaret McCasland, Erica Van Etten, Greg Spence Wolf, Bob LeRoy, LeGrace Benson, Wally Woods, Jennifer Elges, and Donald Stephenson.  In May 1999 Glover turned the administration of Ithaca HOURS over to the newly elected Board of Directors.

Businesses who receive Hours must spend them on local goods and services, thus building a network of inter-supporting local businesses. While non-local businesses are welcome to accept Hours, those businesses need to spend them on local goods and services to be economically sustainable.\n\nIn their mission to promote local economic development, the Board of Directors also makes interest-free loans of Ithaca HOURS to local businesses and grants to local [[non-profit organizations]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New York|Numismatics|Business and economics}}\n* [[Local currency]]\n* [[List of community currencies in the United States]]\n* [[Labour voucher]]\n* [[Time-based currency]]\n* [[W\u00f6rgl]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ithacahours.com/ Official Ithaca Hours Website]\n* [http://www.paulglover.org/hours.html Founder's Website]\n* [http://neweconomicsinstitute.org/content/local-currencies E F Schumacher Society Local Currency website]\n* [http://www.schumachersociety.org/local_currencies/2004_conference_report.html Brief History of Local Currencies]\n* [http://ccmag.net/ Community Currency Online Magazine]\n\n{{Ithaca, New York}}\n\n[[Category:Ithaca, New York|Hours]]\n[[Category:Local currencies]]\n[[Category:Economics and time]]\n[[Category:Currency introduced in 1991]]", "sha1": "86riu8dy0q7igzccpn4ti021t9gvijv"}}, {"title": "Immortal Seven", "ns": "0", "id": "14978", "redirect": {"title": "Invitation to William"}, "revision": {"id": "57702333", "parentid": "56545563", "timestamp": "2006-06-09T13:57:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Iveagh Gardens", "id": "664855"}, "comment": "Merged and redirected as discussed", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Invitation to William]]", "sha1": "9pc60r65im800dm0s10nm1vj3j9767u"}}, {"title": "Interstellar cloud", "ns": "0", "id": "14979", "revision": {"id": "847658538", "parentid": "844004625", "timestamp": "2018-06-26T22:21:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "FrescoBot", "id": "9021902"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: [[User:FrescoBot/Links|link syntax]] and minor changes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Carved by Massive Stars.jpg|thumb|300px|A small part of the [[emission nebula]] [[NGC 6357]].

Put differently, an interstellar cloud is a denser-than-average region of the [[interstellar medium]], (ISM), the [[matter]] and radiation that exists in the [[outer space|space]] between the [[star system]]s in a [[galaxy]]. Depending on the [[density]], size, and temperature of a given cloud, its [[hydrogen]] can be neutral, making an [[H I region]]; ionized, or plasma making it an [[H II region]]; or molecular, which are referred to simply as [[molecular cloud]]s, or sometimetimes dense clouds. Neutral and [[ionization|ionized]] clouds are sometimes also called ''diffuse clouds''. An interstellar cloud is formed by the gas and dust particles from a [[red giant]] in its later life.\n\n==Chemical compositions==\nThe chemical composition of interstellar clouds is determined by studying [[electromagnetic radiation]] or EM radiation that they emanate, and we receive \u2013 from [[radio wave]]s through [[visible light]], to [[gamma rays]] on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] \u2013 that we receive from them. Large [[radio telescope]]s scan the intensity in the sky of particular [[frequency|frequencies]] of electromagnetic radiation which are characteristic of certain [[molecule]]s' [[electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectra]]. Some interstellar clouds are cold and tend to give out EM radiation of large [[wavelength]]s. A map of the abundance of these molecules can be made, enabling an understanding of the varying composition of the clouds. In hot clouds, there are often ions of many [[chemical element|elements]], whose spectra can be seen in visible and [[ultraviolet light]].\n\n[[Radio telescope]]s can also scan over the frequencies from one point in the map, recording the intensities of each type of molecule. Peaks of frequencies mean that an abundance of that molecule or atom is present in the cloud. The height of the peak is proportional to the relative percentage that it makes up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/how_l1/spectra.html|title=Spectra and What Scientists Can Learn From Them|date= November 2009|author=Project Leader Dr. Lochner|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA|accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Unexpected chemicals detected in interstellar clouds==\n[[File:Diving into the Lagoon Nebula.OGG|thumb|View inside the [[Lagoon Nebula]].]]\nUntil recently the rates of reactions in interstellar clouds were expected to be very slow, with minimal products being produced due to the low temperature and density of the clouds. However, [[organic chemistry|organic]] molecules were observed in the spectra that [[scientist]]s would not have expected to find under these conditions, such as [[formaldehyde]], [[methanol]], and [[vinyl alcohol]]. The reactions needed to create such substances are familiar to scientists only at the much higher temperatures and pressures of earth and earth-based laboratories. The fact that they were found indicates that these [[chemical reaction]]s in interstellar clouds take place faster than suspected, likely in gas-phase reactions unfamiliar to organic chemistry as observed on earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2001/vinylalco/|title=Scientists Toast the Discovery of Vinyl Alcohol in Interstellar Space|date= October 2001|author=Charles Blue|publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> These reactions are studied in the [[CRESU experiment]].\n\nInterstellar clouds also provide a medium to study the presence and proportions of metals in space.  The presence and ratios of these elements may help develop theories on the means of their production, especially when their proportions are inconsistent with those expected to arise from stars as a result of [[nucleosynthesis|fusion]] and thereby suggest alternate means, such as [[cosmic ray spallation]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Knauth | first1 = D. | last2 = Federman | first2 = S. | last3 = Lambert | first3 = D. | year = 2000 | title = Newly Synthesized Lithium in the Interstellar Medium | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6787/abs/405656a0.html | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = | pages = 656\u2013658 | doi=10.1038/35015028 | pmid=10864316|bibcode = 2000Natur.405..656K }}</ref>\n\n==High-velocity cloud==\n{{Main|High-velocity cloud}}\n[[File:IRAS 10082-5647.jpg|thumb|[[Reflection nebula]] IRAS 10082-5647 observed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n\nThese interstellar clouds possess a velocity higher than can be explained by the rotation of the [[Milky Way]].<ref>Navarro, J.

The first [[basilica]] was completed in 360 and remodelled from 404 to 415, but had been damaged in 532 in the course of the [[Nika riots|Nika Riot]], \u201cThe temple of Sophia, the [[baths of Zeuxippus]], and the imperial courtyard from the [[Propylaia]] all the way to the so-called House of Ares were burned up and destroyed, as were both of the great porticoes that lead to the forum that is named after Constantine, houses of prosperous people, and a great deal of other properties.\u201d<ref>Prokopios, page 138</ref>\n\nThe warring factions of Byzantine society, the Blues and the Greens, opposed each other in the [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] and often resorted to violence.  During the Nika Riot, more than thirty thousand people died.<ref>Prokopios, page 144</ref>   Emperor Justinian I ensured that his new structure would not be burned down, like its predecessors, by commissioning architects that would build the church mainly out of stone, rather than wood, \u201cHe compacted it of baked brick and mortar, and in many places bound it together with iron, but made no use of wood, so that the church should no longer prove combustible.\u201d<ref>Mango, page 78</ref>\n\nIsidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles originally planned on a main hall of the Hagia Sophia that measured 70 by 75 metres (230 x 250 ft), making it the largest [[Church (building)|church]] in Constantinople, but the original dome was nearly 6 metres (20 ft) lower than it was constructed, \u201cJustinian suppressed these riots and took the opportunity of marking his victory by erecting in 532-7 the new Hagia Sophia, one of the largest, most lavish, and most expensive buildings of all time.\u201d<ref>Watkin, page 76</ref>\n\nAlthough Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles were not formally educated in [[architecture]], they were scientists that could organize the logistics of drawing thousands of [[laborer|labourer]]s and unprecedented loads of rare [[raw material]]s from around the Roman Empire to create the Hagia Sophia for Emperor Justinian I.  The finished product was built in admirable form for the Roman Emperor, \u201cAll of these elements marvellously fitted together in mid-air, suspended from one another and reposing only on the parts adjacent to them, produce a unified and most remarkable harmony in the work, and yet do not allow the spectators to rest their gaze upon any one of them for a length of time.\u201d<ref>Mango, page 75</ref>\n\nThe Hagia Sophia architects innovatively combined the longitudinal structure of a Roman basilica and the central plan of a drum-supported dome, in order to withstand the high magnitude [[earthquake]]s of the [[Marmara Region]], \u201cHowever, in May 558, little more than 20 years after the Church\u2019s dedication, following the earthquakes of August 553 and [[557 Constantinople earthquake|December 557]], parts of the central dome and its supporting structure system collapsed.\u201d<ref>Cakmak, page 693</ref>    The Hagia Sophia was repeatedly cracked by earthquakes and was quickly repaired.  Isidore of Miletus\u2019 nephew, [[Isidore the Younger]], introduced the new dome design that can be viewed in the Hagia Sophia in present-day [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].\n\nAfter a great earthquake in 989 ruined the dome of Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine officials summoned [[Trdat the Architect]] to Byzantium to organize repairs.

Three main pillars \u2013 or areas of work \u2013 underpin the IAEA's mission: Safety and Security; Science and Technology; and Safeguards and Verification.\n\nThe IAEA as an autonomous organisation is not under direct control of the UN, but the IAEA does report to both the UN General Assembly and Security Council. Unlike most other specialised international agencies, the IAEA does much of its work with the Security Council, and not with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]. The structure and functions of the IAEA are defined by its founding document, the IAEA Statute (see below). The IAEA has three main bodies: the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]], the [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]], and the Secretariat.\n\nThe IAEA exists to pursue the \"safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear sciences and technology\" (Pillars 2005). The IAEA executes this mission with three main functions: the inspection of existing nuclear facilities to ensure their peaceful use, providing information and developing standards to ensure the safety and security of nuclear facilities, and as a hub for the various fields of science involved in the peaceful applications of nuclear technology.\n\nThe IAEA recognises knowledge as the nuclear energy industry's most valuable asset and resource, without which the industry cannot operate safely and economically. Following the IAEA General Conference since 2002 resolutions the [[Nuclear Knowledge Management]], a formal programme was established to address Member States' priorities in the 21st century.<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/nuclearenergy/nuclearknowledge/index.html IAEA Nuclear Knowledge Management Programme]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the IAEA developed a [[Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy]] (PACT). PACT responds to the needs of developing countries to establish, to improve, or to expand radiotherapy treatment programs. The IAEA is raising money to help efforts by its Member States to save lives and to reduce suffering of cancer victims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cancer.iaea.org/index.asp |title=Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy |publisher=IAEA |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe IAEA has established programs to help developing countries in planning to build systematically the capability to manage a nuclear power program, including the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Group,<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/NuclearPower/Infrastructure/ Nuclear Power Infrastructure], the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Group (INIG), International Atomic Energy Agency.</ref> which has carried out Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review missions in [[Indonesia]], [[Jordan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trendingtech.info/technology/iaea-ready-to-help-build-nuclear-power-plant-indonesia/ |title=IAEA Ready to Help Build Nuclear Power Plant Indonesia |publisher=Trendingtech.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101192227/http://www.trendingtech.info/technology/iaea-ready-to-help-build-nuclear-power-plant-indonesia/ |archivedate=1 January 2011}}</ref> The IAEA reports that roughly 60 countries are considering how to include nuclear power in their energy plans.<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2010/year-in-review.html IAEA Highlights in 2010], A Retrospective View of Year's Major Events.</ref>\n\nTo enhance the sharing of information and experience among IAEA Member States concerning the seismic safety of nuclear facilities, in 2008 the IAEA established the International Seismic Safety Centre. This centre is establishing safety standards and providing for their application in relation to site selection, site evaluation and seismic design.\n\n===Board of Governors===\n{{Main|Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency}}\nThe Board of Governors is one of two policy making bodies of the IAEA. The Board consists of 22 member states elected by the General Conference, and at least 10 member states nominated by the outgoing Board. The outgoing Board designates the ten members who are the most advanced in atomic energy technology, plus the most advanced members from any of the following [[IAEA Areas|areas]] that are not represented by the first ten: North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle East and South Asia, South East Asia, the Pacific, and the Far East. These members are designated for one year terms. The General Conference elects 22 members from the remaining nations to two-year terms. Eleven are elected each year. The 22 elected members must also represent a stipulated geographic diversity. The 35 Board members for the 2018\u20132019 period are:<ref>https://www.iaea.org/about/governance/board-of-governors</ref> Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Morocco, the Netherlands, Niger, Pakistan, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Serbia, South Africa, the Sudan, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nThe Board, in its five yearly meetings, is responsible for making most of the policy of the IAEA. The Board makes recommendations to the General Conference on IAEA activities and budget, is responsible for publishing IAEA standards and appoints the Director General subject to General Conference approval. Board members each receive one vote. Budget matters require a two-thirds majority. All other matters require only a simple majority. The simple majority also has the power to stipulate issues that will thereafter require a two-thirds majority. Two-thirds of all Board members must be present to call a vote. The Board elects its own chairman.\n\n===General Conference===\nThe [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]] is made up of all 170 member states. It meets once a year, typically in September, to approve the actions and budgets passed on from the Board of Governors. The General Conference also approves the nominee for Director General and requests reports from the Board on issues in question (Statute). Each member receives one vote. Issues of budget, Statute amendment and suspension of a member's privileges require a two- thirds majority and all other issues require a simple majority. Similar to the Board, the General Conference can, by simple majority, designate issues to require a two- thirds majority. The General Conference elects a President at each annual meeting to facilitate an effective meeting. The President only serves for the duration of the session (Statute).\n\nThe main function of the General Conference is to serve as a forum for debate on current issues and policies. Any of the other IAEA organs, the Director General, the Board and member states can table issues to be discussed by the General Conference (IAEA Primer). This function of the General Conference is almost identical to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]].\n\n===Secretariat===\nThe Secretariat is the professional and general service staff of the IAEA. The Secretariat is headed by the Director General. The Director General is responsible for enforcement of the actions passed by the Board of Governors and the General Conference. The Director General is selected by the Board and approved by the General Conference for renewable four-year terms. The Director General oversees six departments that do the actual work in carrying out the policies of the IAEA: Nuclear Energy, Nuclear Safety and Security, Nuclear Sciences and Applications, Safeguards, Technical Cooperation, and Management.\n\nThe IAEA budget is in two parts. The regular budget funds most activities of the IAEA and is assessed to each member nation (\u20ac344 million in 2014).<ref name=budget2014>{{cite web | title= IAEA Regular Budget for 2014 |url=http://www.iaea.org/About/budget.html |accessdate= 7 June 2014}}</ref> The Technical Cooperation Fund is funded by voluntary contributions with a general target in the US$90&nbsp;million range.<ref name=budget2014 />\n\n==Missions==\nThe IAEA is generally described as having three main missions:\n* '''Peaceful uses''': Promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by its member states,\n* '''Safeguards''': Implementing safeguards to verify that nuclear energy is not used for military purposes, and\n* '''Nuclear safety''': Promoting high standards for nuclear safety.<ref name=\"IAEA Mission Statement\">{{cite web|title=The IAEA Mission Statement|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/mission.html|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Peaceful uses===\nAccording to Article II of the IAEA Statute, the objective of the IAEA is \"to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world.\" Its primary functions in this area, according to Article III, are to encourage research and development, to secure or provide materials, services, equipment and facilities for Member States, to foster exchange of scientific and technical information and training.<ref name=\"IAEA Statute\">[https://www.iaea.org/about/statute IAEA Statute]</ref>\n\nThree of the IAEA's six Departments are principally charged with promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

If the Board recommends approval, and the General Conference approves the application for membership, the State must then submit its instrument of acceptance of the IAEA Statute to the United States, which functions as the depositary Government for the IAEA Statute. The State is considered a member when its acceptance letter is deposited. The United States then informs the IAEA, which notifies other IAEA Member States.

It codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international [[scheduled air transport|air transport]] to ensure safe and orderly growth.<ref name=\"icaocodification\">{{cite web |title = IT in general Aviation: Pen and Paper vs. Bits and Bytes |url = http://hoehne.net/files/hoehne_master-thesis_llm.pdf |first = Sebastian |last = H\u00f6hne |publisher = hoehne.net |accessdate = 5 May 2014 |page = 38}}</ref> Its headquarters is located in the ''[[Quartier international de Montr\u00e9al|Quartier International]]'' of [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.\n\nThe ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, its infrastructure, [[flight inspection]], prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international [[civil aviation]]. ICAO defines the protocols for [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air accident]] investigation followed by [[:Category:Organizations investigating aviation accidents and incidents|transport safety authorities]] in countries signatory to the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation]].\n\nThe Air Navigation Commission (ANC) is the technical body within ICAO. The Commission is composed of 19 Commissioners, nominated by the ICAO's contracting states, and appointed by the ICAO Council.<ref name=\"ICAO ANC\">{{cite web|title=Air Navigation Commission|url=http://www.icao.int/about-icao/Pages/Air-Navigation-Commission.aspx|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> Commissioners serve as independent experts, who although nominated by their states, do not serve as state or political representatives. The development of international [[Standards And Recommended Practices]] is done under the direction of the ANC through the formal process of ICAO Panels. Once approved by the Commission, standards are sent to the Council, the political body of ICAO, for consultation and coordination with the Member States before final adoption.\n\nICAO is distinct from other international air transport organizations, like the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), a [[trade association]] representing [[airline]]s; the [[Civil Air Navigation Services Organization]] (CANSO), an organization for [[Air navigation service provider]]s (ANSPs); and the [[Airports Council International]], a trade association of [[Airport authority|airport authorities]].\n\n== History ==\nThe forerunner to ICAO was the '''International Commission for Air Navigation''' (ICAN).<ref name=\"icaocodification\"/> It held its first convention in 1903 in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire|Germany]], but no agreements were reached among the eight countries that attended. At the second convention in 1906, also held in Berlin, 27 countries attended. The third convention, held in [[London]] in 1912 allocated the first radio [[callsign]]s for use by aircraft.

Under its terms, a '''Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization''' (PICAO) was to be established, to be replaced in turn by a permanent organization when 26 countries ratified the convention. Accordingly, PICAO began operating on 6 June 1945, replacing ICAN. The 26th country ratified the Convention on 5 March 1947 and, consequently PICAO was disestablished on 4 April 1947 and replaced by ICAO, which began operations the same day. In October 1947, ICAO became an agency of the [[United Nations]] linked to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).<ref name=\"www2.icao.int\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icao.int/about-icao/History/Pages/default.aspx|title=icao.int International Civil Aviation Organization History|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=ICAN />\n\nIn April 2013 [[Qatar]] offered to serve as the new permanent seat of the Organization.

This makes it a [[standards organization]].\n\nEach country should have an accessible [[Aeronautical Information Publication]] (AIP), based on standards defined by ICAO, containing information essential to [[air navigation]]. Countries are required to update their AIP manuals every 28 days and so provide definitive regulations, procedures and information for each country about [[airspace]] and airports. ICAO's standards also dictate that temporary hazards to aircraft are regularly published using [[NOTAM]]s.\n\nICAO defines an [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (also known as ICAO Standard Atmosphere), a model of the standard variation of [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[density]], and [[viscosity]] with [[altitude]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. This is useful in calibrating instruments and designing aircraft.<ref name=\"ICAO 1993\">{{cite book |title=Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere: extended to 80 kilometres (262,500 feet) |year=1993 |publisher=ICAO |location=Montreal |isbn=92-9194-004-6 |url=http://legacy.icao.int/cgi/ISBN_txt.pl?16 |edition=3rd |accessdate=2012-09-06 |language=en, fr, es, ru |format=CD-ROM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206111249/http://legacy.icao.int/cgi/ISBN_txt.pl?16 |archive-date=6 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nICAO standardizes [[machine-readable passport]]s worldwide.<ref name=\"ICAO MRTD\">{{cite web |title=Welcome to the ICAO Machine Readable Travel Documents Programme |url=http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=ICAO |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> Such [[passport]]s have an area where some of the information otherwise written in textual form is written as strings of alphanumeric characters, printed in a manner suitable for [[optical character recognition]].

ICAO publishes Document 9303 ''Machine Readable Travel Documents'', the technical standard for machine-readable passports.<ref name=\"ICAO 2006\">{{cite book |publisher=ICAO |title=Machine Readable Travel Documents, Document 9303 |year=2006 |edition=Sixth |url=http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/Document9303.aspx |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> A more recent standard is for [[biometric passport]]s. These contain [[biometrics]] to authenticate the identity of travellers. The passport's critical information is stored on a tiny [[RFID]] computer chip, much like information stored on [[smartcard]]s. Like some smartcards, the passport book design calls for an embedded contactless chip that is able to hold [[digital signature]] data to ensure the integrity of the passport and the biometric data.\n\nICAO is active in infrastructure management, including [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]] / [[Air traffic management|Air Traffic Management]] (CNS/ATM) systems, which employ digital technologies (like satellite systems with various levels of automation) in order to maintain a [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] global [[air traffic management]] system.<ref name=\"ICAO CNSATM\">{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Management|url=http://www.icao.int/sustainability/Pages/eap-im-cns-atm.aspx|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Aerodrome Reference Code ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Aerodrome Reference Code<ref name=ICAO14>ICAO Annex 14 \u2014 Aerodromes</ref>\n!

The ICAO code is based on the region and country of the airport\u2014for example, [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] has an ICAO code of LFPG, where '''L''' indicates Southern Europe, '''F''', France, '''PG''', Paris de Gaulle, while [[Orly Airport]] has the code LFPO (the 3rd letter sometimes refers to the particular [[flight information region]] (FIR) or the last two may be arbitrary). In most of the world, ICAO and IATA codes are unrelated; for example, [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] has an IATA code of CDG. However, the location prefix for continental United States is '''K''' and ICAO codes are usually the IATA code with this prefix. For example, the ICAO code for [[Los Angeles International Airport]] is KLAX. [[Canada]] follows a similar pattern, where a prefix of '''C''' is usually added to an IATA code to create the ICAO code. For example, [[Calgary International Airport]] is YYC or CYYC. (In contrast, airports in [[Hawaii]] are in the Pacific region and so have ICAO codes that start with '''PH'''; [[Kona International Airport]]'s code is PHKO. Similarly, airports in [[Alaska]] have ICAO codes that start with '''PA'''. [[Merrill Field]], for instance is PAMR.) Note that not all airports are assigned codes in both systems; for example, airports that do not have airline service do not need an IATA code.\n\nICAO also assigns 3-letter [[ICAO airline designator|airline codes]] (versus the more-familiar 2-letter IATA codes\u2014for example, '''UAL''' vs. '''UA''' for [[United Airlines]]). ICAO also provides [[telephony]] designators to aircraft operators worldwide, a one- or two-word designator used on the radio, usually, but not always, similar to the aircraft operator name. For example, the identifier for [[Japan Airlines]] International is '''JAL''' and the designator is '''Japan Air''', but [[Aer Lingus]] is '''EIN''' and '''Shamrock'''. Thus, a Japan Airlines flight numbered 111 would be written as \"JAL111\" and pronounced \"Japan Air One One One\" on the radio, while a similarly numbered Aer Lingus would be written as \"EIN111\" and pronounced \"Shamrock One One One\". In the US, FAA practices<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/ATC/atc0204.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416174212/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0204.html |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> require the digits of the flight number to be spoken in group format (\"Japan Air One Eleven\" in the above example) while individual digits are used for the aircraft tail number used for unscheduled civil flights.\n\nICAO maintains the standards for [[aircraft registration]] (\"tail numbers\"), including the alphanumeric codes that identify the country of registration. For example, airplanes registered in the United States have tail numbers starting with '''N'''.\n\nICAO is also responsible for issuing [[alphanumeric]] [[aircraft]] type codes containing two to four characters. These codes provide the identification that is typically used in [[flight plan]]s. The [[Boeing 747]] would use '''B741''', '''B742''', '''B743''', etc., depending on the particular variant.\n\n== Regions and regional offices ==\n[[File:ICAO World Headquarters.jpg|thumb|ICAO World Headquarters, [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada]]\nICAO has a headquarters, seven regional offices, and one regional sub-office:<ref name=\"ICAO Contacts\">{{cite web|title=Contact Us|url=http://www.icao.int/Pages/Contact_us.aspx|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>\n* Headquarters&nbsp;\u2013 [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada\n* Asia and Pacific (APAC)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]; Sub-office&nbsp;\u2013 [[Beijing]], [[China]]\n* Eastern and Southern African (ESAF)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]\n* Europe and North Atlantic (EUR/NAT)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Paris]], [[France]]\n* Middle East (MID)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]\n* North American, Central American and Caribbean (NACC)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]\n* South American (SAM)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lima]], [[Peru]]\n* Western and Central African (WACAF)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n=== List of Secretaries General ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!

Instead, the Protocol invites developed countries to pursue the limitation or reduction of emissions through the International Civil Aviation Organization. ICAO's environmental committee continues to consider the potential for using market-based measures such as trading and charging, but this work is unlikely to lead to global action. It is currently developing guidance for states who wish to include aviation in an emissions trading scheme (ETS) to meet their Kyoto commitments, and for airlines who wish to participate voluntarily in a trading scheme.\n\nEmissions from domestic aviation are included within the Kyoto targets agreed by countries. This has led to some national policies such as fuel and emission taxes for domestic air travel in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Norway]], respectively. Although some countries tax the fuel used by domestic aviation, there is no duty on [[kerosene]] used on international flights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate Change: Aviation Emissions, an ignored but fast growing problem|url=http://www.aef.org.uk/downloads/Factsheetclimate.pdf|publisher=greenskies.org|accessdate=3 August 2011|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nICAO is currently opposed to the inclusion of aviation in the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS). The [[European Union|EU]], however, is pressing ahead with its plans to include aviation.\n\n===Agreement on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from international aviation, October 2016===\n{{further|Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation}}\n\nOn October 6, 2016, the ICAO finalized an agreement among its 191 member nations to address the more than {{val|1000|ul=t}} of carbon dioxide emitted annually by international passenger and cargo flights.  The agreement will use an offsetting scheme called CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) under which forestry and other carbon-reducing activities are directly funded, amounting to about 2% of annual revenues for the sector.  Rules against 'double counting' should ensure that existing forest protection efforts are not recycled.  The scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and China, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date.  Under the agreement, the global aviation emissions target is a 50% reduction by 2050 relative to 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Michael|title=Preparing for CORSIA Take-Off|url=http://www.ieta.org/resources/Resources/GHG_Report/2017/Preparing%20for%20CORSIA%20Take-off%20-%20Gill.pdf|website=IETA.org|accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] reaction to the deal was mixed.<ref name=\"milman-2016\">\n{{cite news\n | first = Oliver | last = Milman\n | title = First deal to curb aviation emissions agreed in landmark UN accord\n | date = 6 October 2016\n | work = The Guardian\n | location = London, United Kingdom\n | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations\n | access-date = 2016-10-20\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Henry Fountain |title=\u2018Aviation\u2019s Paris Moment\u2019 as Nations Near Emissions Deal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/business/energy-environment/aviations-paris-moment-as-nations-near-emissions-deal.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |date=September 25, 2016 |access-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Henry Fountain |title=Over 190 Countries Adopt Plan to Offset Air Travel Emissions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/science/190-countries-adopt-plan-to-offset-jet-emissions.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |date=October 6, 2016 |access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe agreement has critics.

IMO is governed by an assembly of members and is financially administered by a council of members elected from the assembly. The work of IMO is conducted through five committees and these are supported by technical subcommittees. Other UN organisations may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status is granted to qualified non-governmental organisations.\n\nIMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are representative of the organisation's members. The secretariat is composed of a [[Secretary-General]] who is periodically elected by the assembly, and various divisions such as those for marine safety, environmental protection and a conference section.\n\n==History==\n[[File:International Maritime Organization Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|The Headquarters of the IMO are located on Albert Embankment, [[Lambeth]], London.]]\n\n=== SOLAS ===\n{{main|SOLAS Convention}}\n\nInter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) was formed in order to bring the regulation of the safety of shipping into an international framework, for which the creation of the United Nations provided an opportunity. Hitherto such international conventions had been initiated piecemeal, notably the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS), first adopted in 1914 following the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' disaster.<ref name=\"about\"/> IMCO's first task was to update that Convention; the resulting 1960 Convention was subsequently recast and updated in 1974 and it is that Convention that has been subsequently modified and updated to adapt to changes in safety requirements and technology.\n\nWhen IMCO began its operations in 1959 certain other pre-existing conventions were brought under its aegis, most notable the [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil]] (OILPOL) 1954. The first meetings of the newly formed IMCO were held in London in 1959.<ref name=IMOHistoryInPics/> Throughout its existence IMCO, later renamed the IMO in 1982, has continued to produce new and updated conventions across a wide range of maritime issues covering not only safety of life and marine pollution but also encompassing safe navigation, search and rescue, wreck removal, tonnage measurement, liability and compensation, ship recycling, the training and certification of seafarers, and piracy. More recently SOLAS has been amended to bring an increased focus on maritime security through the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code]]. The IMO has also increased its focus on smoke emissions from ships.\n\nIn January 1959, IMO began to maintain and promote the 1954 OILPOL Convention. Under the guidance of IMO, the convention was amended in 1962, 1969, and 1971.\n\n=== Torrey Canyon ===\n{{main|Torrey Canyon oil spill}}\nAs oil trade and industry developed, many people in the industry began to recognise a need for further improvements in regards to oil pollution prevention at sea. This became increasingly apparent in 1967, when the tanker ''[[SS Torrey Canyon|Torrey Canyon]]'' spilled 120,000 tons of crude oil when it ran aground entering the English Channel<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofMARPOL/Documents/MARPOL%2073-78%20Brief%20History%20-%20List%20of%20amendments%20and%20how%20to%20find%20them.htm|title = MARPOL73-78:  Brief history \u2013 list of amendments to date and where to find them|date = March 2012|accessdate = 1 June 2015|website = |publisher = IMO|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Torrey Canyon'' grounding was the largest oil pollution incident recorded up to that time.

In 1969, the IMO Assembly decided to host an international gathering in 1973 dedicated to this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> The goal at hand was to develop an international agreement for controlling general environmental contamination by ships when out at sea.\n\nDuring the next few years IMO brought to the forefront a series of measures designed to prevent large ship accidents and to minimise their effects.  It also detailed how to deal with the environmental threat caused by routine ship duties such as the cleaning of oil cargo tanks or the disposal of engine room wastes.  By tonnage, the aforementioned was a bigger problem than accidental pollution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe most significant thing to come out of this conference was the [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973]].  It covers not only accidental and operational oil pollution but also different types of pollution by chemicals, goods in packaged form, sewage, garbage and air pollution.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe original [[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL]] was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come into force due to lack of ratifications. The current convention is a combination of [[MARPOL 73/78|1973 Convention]] and the 1978 Protocol. It entered into force on 2 October 1983.

As of 2018, there are 173 member states of the IMO, which includes [[List of United Nations member states|172 of the UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]]. The first state to ratify the convention was the United Kingdom in 1949. The most recent members to join were [[Armenia]] and [[Nauru]], which became IMO members in January and May 2018, respectively.<ref name=IMO>{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/Membership/Pages/MemberStates.aspx |title=Member States |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe three associate members of the IMO are the [[Faroe Islands]], Hong Kong and [[Macao]].\n\nMost UN member states that are not members of IMO are landlocked countries. These include Afghanistan, Andorra, Bhutan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  However, the Federated States of Micronesia, an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, is also a non-member.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe IMO consists of an Assembly, a Council and five main Committees: the Maritime Safety Committee; the Marine Environment Protection Committee; the Legal Committee; the Technical Co-operation Committee and the Facilitation Committee.

The most well known is the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS), as well as [[International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation]] (OPRC). Others include the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC).<ref name=\"iocp\">{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iopcfunds.org/about-us/|publisher=International Oil Compensation Funds|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> It also functions as a depository of yet to be ratified treaties, such as the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 ([[HNS Convention]]) and Nairobi International Convention of Removal of Wrecks (2007).<ref name=\"Removal of Wrecks\">{{citation|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm82/8243/8243.pdf | title=Nairobi International Convention on Removal of Wrecks|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIMO regularly enacts regulations, which are broadly enforced by national and local maritime authorities in member countries, such as the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] (COLREG). The IMO has also enacted a [[Port State Control]] (PSC) authority, allowing domestic maritime authorities such as [[coast guard]]s to inspect foreign-flag ships calling at ports of the many port states. Memoranda of Understanding (protocols) were signed by some countries unifying Port State Control procedures among the signatories.\n\nConventions, Codes and Regulations:\n*[[MARPOL 73/78|MARPOL Convention]]\n**[[Marpol Annex I]]\n*[[SOLAS Convention]]\n**[[International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code|IMDG Code]]\n**[[International Safety Management Code|ISM Code]]\n**[[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|ISPS Code]]\n*[[STCW Convention]]\n*[[International Code of Signals]]\n*[[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]]\n*[[HNS Convention]]\n*[[International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage]]\n*[[International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage]]\n*[[Ballast Water Management Convention|International Ballast Water Management Convention]]\n\n==Current issues==\nRecent initiatives at the IMO have included amendments to [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]], which upgraded [[fire protection]] standards on [[passenger ship]]s, the [[STCW Convention|International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW)]] which establishes basic requirements on training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers and to the Convention on the Prevention of Maritime Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]]), which required double hulls on all [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]].\n\nIn December 2002, new amendments to the 1974 SOLAS Convention were enacted. These amendments gave rise to the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code]], which went into effect on 1 July 2004. The concept of the code is to provide layered and redundant defences against smuggling, terrorism, piracy, stowaways, etc. The ISPS Code required most ships and port facilities engaged in international trade to establish and maintain strict security procedures as specified in ship and port specific Ship Security Plans and Port Facility Security Plans.\n\nThe IMO has a role in tackling international [[climate change]]. The First Intersessional Meeting of IMO's Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships took place in Oslo, Norway (23\u201327 June 2008), tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future IMO regime to control [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from international shipping, and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).<ref>[http://www.sustainableshipping.com/news/2008/06/72085?gsid=bd38b351cb4e396c6349848dcc49aaf2&asi=1 SustainableShipping: (S) News \u2013 IMO targets greenhouse gas emissions (17 Jun 2008) \u2013 The forum dedicated to marine transportation and the environment<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The IMO participated in the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris seeking to establish itself as the \"appropriate international body to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships engaged in international trade\".<ref>http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/AirPollution/Pages/IMO-at-COP21.aspx IMO at COP21 statement</ref> Nonetheless, there has been widespread criticism of the IMO's relative inaction since the conclusion of the Paris conference, with the initial data-gathering step of a three-stage process to reduce maritime greenhouse emissions expected to last until 2020.<ref>[http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/07/15/offshore-carbon-why-a-climate-deal-for-shipping-is-sinking/ Offshore Carbon: Why a Climate Deal for Shipping is Sinking (Climate Home)]</ref> The IMO has also taken action to mitigate the global effects of ballast water and sediment discharge, through the 2004 [[Ballast Water Management Convention]], which entered into force in September 2017.<ref name=IMO-BWM-media>{{cite web |url= http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/BWM/Pages/default.aspx|title= Ballast water management - the control of harmful invasive species|publisher=International Maritime Organization |access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe IMO is also responsible for publishing the [[International Code of Signals]] for use between merchant and naval vessels. IMO has harmonised information available to seafarers and shore-side traffic services called [[e-Navigation]]. An e-Navigation strategy was ratified in 2005, and an implementation plan was developed through three IMO sub-committees. The plan was completed by 2014 and implemented in November of that year.<ref>[http://www.itsnorge.no/maritim/IMOE-Navigationstrategy.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516233627/http://www.itsnorge.no/maritim/IMOE-Navigationstrategy.html |date=16 May 2013 }}</ref> IMO has also served as a key partner and enabler of US international and interagency efforts to establish [[Maritime Domain Awareness]].\n\n==Governance of IMO==\nThe governing body of the International Maritime Organization is the Assembly which meets every two years. In between Assembly sessions a Council, consisting of 40 Member States elected by the Assembly, acts as the governing body.

Among these officials, 900 work in technical cooperation programmes and projects.\n\nIn 1969, the organization received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for improving fraternity and peace among nations, pursuing [[decent work]] and [[social justice|justice]] for workers, and providing technical assistance to other developing nations.<ref name=nobel>{{cite web\n | title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1969\n | work=Nobelprize.org\n | url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1969/labour-history.html\n | accessdate=5 July 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nThe International Labour Organization has developed a system of [[international labour standards]]  aimed at promoting opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and dignity.<ref name=\"international labour standards\">{{cite web\n | title=Introduction to International Labour Standards\n | work=ilo.org\n | url=https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm\n}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Governance, organization, and membership==\n[[File:ILO hall.JPG|thumb|ILO headquarters in [[Geneva]]]]\n\nUnlike other United Nations specialized agencies, the International Labour Organization has a [[Tripartism|tripartite]] governing structure that brings together governments, employers, and workers of 187 member States, to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men.\nThe very structure of the ILO, where workers and employers together have an equal voice with governments in its deliberations, shows social dialogue in action. It ensures that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in ILO labour standards, policies and programmes.\n\n===Governing body===\nThe Governing Body is the executive body of the International Labour Organization (the Office is the secretariat of the Organization). It meets three times a year, in March, June and November. It takes decisions on ILO policy, decides the agenda of the International Labour Conference, adopts the draft Programme and Budget of the Organization for submission to the Conference, elects the Director-General, requests information from member states concerning labour matters, appoints commissions of inquiry and supervises the work of the International Labour Office.\n\n[[Juan Somav\u00eda]] was the ILO's Director-General from 1999 until October 2012 when [[Guy Ryder]] was elected. The ILO Governing Body re-elected Guy Rider as Director-General for a second five year-term in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Guy Ryder re-elected as ILO Director-General for a second term\n | work=ilo.org\n | url=https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_534283/lang--en/index.htm\n}}</ref>\n\nThis governing body is composed of 56 titular members (28 Governments, 14 Employers and 14 Workers) and 66 deputy members (28 Governments, 19 Employers and 19 Workers).\n\nTen of the titular government seats are permanently held by States of chief industrial importance ([[Brazil]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[Russian Federation]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Body|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/how-the-ilo-works/governing-body/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=ilo.org|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The other Government members are elected by the Conference every three years (the last elections were held in June 2014).

All of them have individual voting rights and all votes are equal, regardless the population of the delegate's member State. The employer and worker delegates are normally chosen in agreement with the most representative national organizations of employers and workers. Usually, the workers and employers' delegates coordinate their voting. All delegates have the same rights and are not required to vote in blocs.\n\nDelegate have the same rights, they can express themselves freely and vote as they wish. This diversity of viewpoints does not prevent decisions being adopted by very large majorities or unanimously.\n\nHeads of State and prime ministers also participate in the Conference. International organizations, both governmental and others, also attend but as observers.\n\n===Conventions===\n{{main article|List of International Labour Organization Conventions}}\n[[File:ILO building in Geneva with Sunset and Sal\u00e8ve.JPG|thumb|ILO building in Geneva with [[Sal\u00e8ve]] in the background]]\nThrough July 2018, the ILO had adopted 189 conventions. If these conventions are ratified by enough governments, they come in force. However, ILO conventions are considered [[international labour standards]] regardless of ratification. When a convention comes into force, it creates a legal obligation for ratifying nations to apply its provisions.\n\nEvery year the International Labour Conference's Committee on the Application of Standards examines a number of alleged breaches of international labour standards. Governments are required to submit reports detailing their compliance with the obligations of the conventions they have ratified.  Conventions that have not been ratified by member states have the same legal force as recommendations.\n\nIn 1998, the 86th International Labour Conference adopted the ''[[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]]''. This declaration contains four fundamental policies:<ref name=ILO-Declaration>{{cite web|title=ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work|url=http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm|work=Rights at Work|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=16 August 2012|year=1998}}</ref>\n* The right of workers to associate freely and [[Collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]\n* The end of [[Unfree labour|forced and compulsory labour]]\n* The end of [[child labour]]\n* The end of [[Employment discrimination|unfair discrimination among workers]]\n\nThe ILO asserts that its members have an obligation to work towards fully respecting these principles, embodied in relevant ILO conventions. The ILO conventions which embody the fundamental principles have now been ratified by most member states.<ref>See the list of ratifications at [https://archive.is/20120524225645/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/docs/declworld.htm Ilo.org]</ref>\n\n===Recommendations===\nRecommendations do not have the binding force of conventions and are not subject to ratification. Recommendations may be adopted at the same time as conventions to supplement the latter with additional or more detailed provisions. In other cases recommendations may be adopted separately and may address issues separate from particular conventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12010:0::NO:::|title=Recommendations|website=www.ilo.org}}</ref>\n\n===Membership===\n[[File:International Labour Organization.png|thumb|ILO member states]]\n\nAs of April 2016, the ILO has 187 state members. 186 of the 193 [[member states of the United Nations]] plus the [[Cook Islands]] are members of the ILO.<ref>{{cite web|title=ILO Constitution Article 3|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/constq.htm|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091225111436/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/constq.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 December 2009|publisher=Ilo.org|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> The UN member states which are not members of the ILO are [[Andorra]], [[Bhutan]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Monaco]], [[Nauru]], and [[North Korea]].\n\nThe ILO constitution permits any member of the UN to become a member of the ILO.

The core members all knew one another from earlier private professional and ideological networks, in which they exchanged knowledge, experiences, and ideas on social policy. Prewar \"[[Epistemic community (international relations)|epistemic communities]]\", such as the [[International Association for Labour Legislation]] (IALL), founded in 1900, and political networks, such as the [[socialism|socialist]] [[Second International]], were a decisive factor in the institutionalization of international labour politics.<ref name=\"VanDaele\">{{cite journal|author=VanDaele, Jasmien|title=Engineering Social Peace: Networks, Ideas, And the Founding of the International Labour Organization|journal=International Review of Social History|year= 2005 |volume=50|issue=3|pages= 435\u2013466|doi=10.1017/S0020859005002178}}</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013World War I euphoria, the idea of a \"makeable society\" was an important catalyst behind the social engineering of the ILO architects. As a new discipline, international labour law became a useful instrument for putting social reforms into practice. The utopian ideals of the founding members\u2014social justice and the right to decent work\u2014were changed by diplomatic and political compromises made at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, showing the ILO's balance between idealism and pragmatism.<ref name=\"VanDaele\" />\n\nOver the course of the First World War, the international [[labour movement]] proposed a comprehensive programme of protection for the working classes, conceived as compensation for labour's support during the war.{{clarify|date=August 2012}} Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour unions occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I.

The first was offered by the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] (IFTU), which called for a meeting in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in July 1919. The Bern meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the [[Central Powers]] as equals. [[Samuel Gompers]], president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would only consider President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\n====Commission on International Labour Legislation====\nMeanwhile, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] sought to dampen public support for communism. Subsequently, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] agreed that clauses should be inserted into the emerging peace treaty protecting labour unions and workers' rights, and that an international labour body be established to help guide international labour relations in the future. The advisory Commission on International Labour Legislation was established by the Peace Conference to draft these proposals. The Commission met for the first time on 1 February 1919, and Gompers was elected chairman.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\n[[File:Picture of Samuel Gompers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Samuel Gompers (right) with [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]], 1918]]\nTwo competing proposals for an international body emerged during the Commission's meetings. The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament, one each from labour and management.<ref name=\"Foner\" /> An international labour office would collect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body be authorized only to make recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\nGompers also set the agenda for the draft charter protecting workers' rights. The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That labour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] was amended to require the eight-hour work day ''or'' the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile, international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.<ref name=\"Foner\" />\n\nThe Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace Conference adopted it without amendment on 11 April.

Following the election of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to the U.S. presidency, the new administration made renewed efforts to join the ILO without league membership. On 19 June 1934, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the president to join ILO without joining the League of Nations as a whole. On 22 June 1934, the ILO adopted a resolution inviting the U.S. government to join the organization. On 20 August 1934, the U.S. government responded positively and took its seat at the ILO.\n\n=== Wartime and the United Nations ===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], when Switzerland was surrounded by German troops, ILO director [[John G. Winant]] made the decision to leave Geneva. In August 1940, the [[government of Canada]] officially invited the ILO to be housed at [[McGill University]] in Montreal.

The United States gave notice of full withdrawal on 6 November 1975, stating that the organization had become politicized. The United States also suggested that representation from communist countries was not truly \"[[Tripartism|tripartite]]\"\u2014including government, workers, and employers\u2014because of the structure of these economies. The withdrawal became effective on 1 November 1977.<ref name=Beigbeder1979 />\n\nThe United States returned to the organization in 1980 after extracting some concessions from the organization.

Labour statistics are an important tool for its member states to monitor their progress toward improving labour standards. As part of their statistical work, ILO maintains several databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laborsta.ilo.org/|title=LABORSTA Internet (E)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> This database covers 11 major data series for over 200 countries. In addition, ILO publishes a number of compilations of labour statistics, such as the Key Indicators of Labour Markets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/empelm/what/WCMS_114240/lang--en/index.htm|title=Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> (KILM). KILM covers 20 main indicators on labour participation rates, employment, unemployment, educational attainment, labour cost, and economic performance. Many of these indicators have been prepared by other organizations. For example, the [[Division of international labor comparisons|Division of International Labour Comparisons]] of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] prepares the hourly compensation in manufacturing indicator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kilm.ilo.org/KILMnetBeta/pdf/kilm17EN-2009.pdf|format=PDF|website=International Labour Organization, KILM 17|title=Hourly compensation costs|accessdate=2 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711163957/http://kilm.ilo.org/KILMnetBeta/pdf/kilm17EN-2009.pdf|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><br />\nThe [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] also publishes a yearly report containing a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|work=dol.gov}}</ref> issued by the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]].

Further, it can involve interfering with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school, obliging them to leave school prematurely, or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.\n\nIn its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities \u2013 often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of \"work\" can be called ''child labour'' depends on the child's age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.\n\n====ILO's response to child labour====\n[[File:Minimum age convention.png|thumb|Parties to ILO's 1973 Minimum Age Convention, and the minimum ages they have designated: purple, 14 years; green, 15 years; blue, 16 years]]\n\nThe ILO's [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) was created in 1992 with the overall goal of the progressive elimination of child labour, which was to be achieved through strengthening the capacity of countries to deal with the problem and promoting a worldwide movement to combat child labour. The IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries, with an annual expenditure on technical cooperation projects that reached over US$74 million, \u20ac50 million in 2006. It is the largest programme of its kind globally and the biggest single operational programme of the ILO.\n\nThe number and range of the IPEC's partners have expanded over the years and now include employers' and workers' organizations, other international and government agencies, private businesses, community-based organizations, NGOs, the media, parliamentarians, the judiciary, universities, religious groups and children and their families.\n\nThe IPEC's work to eliminate child labour is an important facet of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Decentwork/lang--en/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195231/http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Decentwork/lang--en/index.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Child labour not only prevents children from acquiring the skills and education they need for a better future,<ref>{{Cite book|last= Von Braun|first=Joachim|editor= Von Braun|title=Employment for poverty reduction and food security|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7q1ZUsatasIC&pg=PA35|accessdate=20 June 2010|series=\"IFPRI Occasional Papers\"|year=1995|publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst|isbn=978-0-89629-332-8|page=35}}</ref> it also perpetuates poverty and affects national economies through losses in competitiveness, productivity and potential income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n====Exceptions in indigenous communities====\nBecause of different cultural views involving labour, the ILO developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates, including convention Nos. 169, 107, 138, and 182, to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities. Convention Nos. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while Nos. 107 and 169 promote the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}</ref> The ILO recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children.\n\nIn many indigenous communities, parents believe children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through the participation in daily life.  Working is seen as a learning process preparing children of the future tasks they will eventually have to do as an adult.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guidelines for Combating Child Labour Among Indigenous Peoples|date=2006|publisher=International Labour Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-2-118748-9|url=http://www.ilo.org/publns}}</ref> It is a belief that the family's and child well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family.  They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Child Development|developmental process]].  While these attitudes toward [[Child work in indigenous American cultures|child work]] remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education.<ref name=\"Larsen\"/> The ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labour while being sensitive to their traditions and values.\nactually they know the how to learn it, normally they can do it.\n\n==Issues==\n{{see also|List of International Labour Organization Conventions}}\n\n===Forced labour===\nThe ILO has considered the fight against [[forced labour]] to be one of its main priorities. During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a colonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards protecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by economic interests. After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal standard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of politically and economically motivated systems of forced labour, but debates were hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers. Since the 1960s, declarations of labour standards as a component of human rights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a need to exercise extraordinary powers over labour in their role as emergency regimes promoting rapid economic development.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Daniel Roger Maul|title=The International Labour Organization and the Struggle against Forced Labour from 1919 to the Present|journal=Labor History|year= 2007|volume= 48|issue=4|pages=477\u2013500|doi=10.1080/00236560701580275}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Forced Labour Convention map.svg|thumb|left|Ratifications of the ILO's 1930 [[Forced Labour Convention]], with non-ratifiers shown in red]]\n\nIn June 1998 the International Labour Conference adopted a [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] and its follow-up that obligates member states to respect, promote and realize freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nWith the adoption of the declaration, the ILO created the InFocus Programme on Promoting the Declaration which is responsible for the reporting processes and technical cooperation activities associated with the declaration; and it carries out awareness raising, advocacy and knowledge functions.\n\nIn November 2001, following the publication of the InFocus Programme's first global report on forced labour, the ILO's governing body created a special action programme to combat forced labour (SAP-FL),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/lang--en/index.htm|title=Forced labour, human trafficking and slavery|work=ilo.org}}</ref> as part of broader efforts to promote the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up.\n\n[[File:Abolition of Forced Labour Convention.png|thumb|Ratifications of the ILO's 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, with non-ratifiers shown in red]]\nSince its inception, the SAP-FL has focused on raising global awareness of forced labour in its different forms, and mobilizing action against its manifestation. Several thematic and country-specific studies and surveys have since been undertaken, on such diverse aspects of forced labour as [[bonded labour]], [[human trafficking]], forced domestic work, rural servitude, and forced prison labour.\n\nThe SAP-FL has spearheaded the ILO's work in this field since early 2002. The programme is designed to:\n* Raise global awareness and understanding of modern forced labour\n* Assist governments in developing and implementing new laws, policies and action plans\n* Develop and disseminate guidance and training materials on key aspects of forced labour and trafficking\n* Implement innovative programmes that combine policy development, capacity building of law enforcement and labour market institutions, and targeted, field-based projects of direct support for both prevention of forced labour and identification and rehabilitation of its victims\n\n===Minimum wage law===\nTo protect the right of labours for fixing [[minimum wage]], ILO has created [[Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928]], [[Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery (Agriculture) Convention, 1951]] and [[Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970]] as [[minimum wage law]].\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is the lead [[UN]]-agency on [[HIV]] workplace policies and programmes and private sector mobilization. The ILO recognizes that HIV has a potentially devastating impact on [[Contract labour|labour]] and [[productivity]] and represents an enormous burden for working people, their families and communities. ILOAIDS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/lang--en/index.htm|title=HIV/AIDS and the World of Work Branch (ILOAIDS)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> is the branch of the ILO dedicated to this issue.\n\nThe ILO has been involved with the HIV response since 1998. In June 2001, the ILO's governing body adopted a pioneering code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of work,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/Publications/WCMS_113783/lang--en/index.htm|title=The ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work|work=ilo.org}}</ref> which was launched during a special session of the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe same year, ILO became a cosponsor of the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS).\n\nIn 2010, the 99th International Labour Conference adopted the ILO's recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the world of work, 2010 (No. 200),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/WCMS_142706/lang--en/index.htm|title=Recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work, 2010 (No. 200)|work=ilo.org}}</ref> the first international labour standard on HIV and AIDS. The recommendation lays out a comprehensive set of principles to protect the rights of HIV-positive workers and their families, while scaling up prevention  in the workplace. Working under the theme of ''Preventing HIV, Protecting Human Rights at Work'', ILOAIDS undertakes a range of policy advisory, research and technical support functions in the area of HIV and AIDS and the world of work. The ILO also works on promoting social protection as a means of reducing vulnerability to HIV and mitigating its impact on those living with or affected by HIV.\n\nILOAIDS is currently engaged in the \"Getting to Zero\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/Eventsandmeetings/campaign/lang--en/index.htm|title=Getting to Zero|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209165450/http://www.ilo.org/aids/Eventsandmeetings/campaign/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> campaign to arrive at zero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero-[[discrimination]] by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsstrategygoalsby2015|title=UNAIDS|work=unaids.org}}</ref> Building on this campaign, ILOAIDS is executing a programme of voluntary and confidential counselling and testing at work, known as VCT@WORK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/aids/WCMS_215899/lang--ja/index.htm|title=VCT@WORK: 5 million women and men workers reached with Voluntary and confidential HIV Counseling and Testing by 2015|work=ilo.org}}</ref>\n\n===Migrant workers===\nAs the word \"migrant\" suggests, migrant workers refer to those who moves from one country to another to do their job. For the rights of [[migrant worker]]s, ILO has adopted conventions, including [[Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975]] and [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]] in 1990.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumaraveloo|first=K Sakthiaseelan|last2=Lunner Kolstrup|first2=Christina|date=2018-07-03|title=Agriculture and musculoskeletal disorders in low- and middle-income countries|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1458671|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227\u2013248|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1458671|issn=1059-924X}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic workers===\nDomestic workers are those who perform a variety of tasks for and in other peoples' homes. For example, they may cook / clean the house and look after children. Yet they are often the ones with the least consideration, excluded from labour and social protection. This is mainly due to the fact that women have traditionally carried out the tasks without pay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Domestic workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/domestic-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=ilo.org|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> For the rights and [[decent work]] of [[domestic worker]]s including [[migrant domestic workers]], ILO has adopted [[Convention on domestic workers]] on 16 June 2011.\n\n===ILO and globalization===\nSeeking a process of [[globalization]] that is inclusive, democratically governed and provides opportunities and tangible benefits for all countries and people. The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization was established by the ILO's governing body in February 2002 at the initiative of the director-general in response to the fact that there did not appear to be a space within the multilateral system that would cover adequately and comprehensively the social dimension of the various aspects of globalization. The World Commission Report, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All, is the first attempt at structured dialogue among representatives of constituencies with different interests and opinions on the social dimension of globalization, aimed at finding common ground on one of the most controversial and divisive subjects of our time.<ref>{{cite web|title=ILO and Globalization|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/economic-and-social-development/globalization/lang--en/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Nations}}\n* [[Centre William Rappard]], first permanent home of the ILO on the north bank of Lake Geneva\n* [[Seoul Declaration on Safety and Health at Work]], 2008\n* [[Social clause]], the integration of seven core ILO labour rights conventions into trade agreements\n* [[United Nations Global Compact]], 1999\u20132000, encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies\n<!-- * [[Maritime Labour Convention Implementation Study]] -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Alcock, A.

However, less than a quarter of the vocabulary of [[Modern English]] is derived from the shared ancestry with other West Germanic languages because of extensive borrowings from [[Norse language|Norse]], [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Latin]], and other languages. It was during the [[Viking]] invasions of the Anglo-Saxon period that Old English was influenced by contact with [[Norse language|Norse]], a group of [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] dialects spoken by the [[Vikings]], who came to control a large region in the North of England known as the [[Danelaw]]. Vocabulary items entering English from Norse (including the pronouns ''they'', and ''them'') are thus attributable to the on-again-off-again Viking occupation of Northern England during the centuries prior to the [[Norman Conquest]] (see, e.g., [[Canute the Great]]). Soon after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, the ''Englisc'' language ceased being a literary language (see, e.g., [[Ormulum]]) and was replaced by [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as the written language of England. During the Norman Period, English absorbed a significant component of French vocabulary (approximately one-third of the vocabulary of [[Modern English]]).  With this new vocabulary, additional vocabulary borrowed from Latin (with Greek, another approximately one-third of [[Modern English]] vocabulary, though some borrowings from Latin and Greek date from later periods), a simplified grammar, and use of the orthographic conventions of French instead of Old English orthography, the language became [[Middle English]] (the language of [[Chaucer]]).  The \"difficulty\" of English as a written language thus began in the [[High Middle Ages]], when French orthographic conventions were used to spell a language whose original, more suitable orthography had been forgotten after centuries of nonuse. During the late medieval period, King [[Henry V of England]] (lived 1387\u20131422) ordered the use of the English of his day in proceedings before him and before the government bureaucracies. That led to the development of [[Middle English#Chancery Standard|Chancery English]], a standardised form used in the government bureaucracy. (The use of so-called [[Law French]] in English courts continued through the Renaissance, however.)\n\nThe emergence of English as a language of [[Wales]] results from the incorporation of Wales into England and also dates from approximately this time period.  Soon afterward, the development of [[printing]] by [[William Caxton|Caxton]] and others accelerated the development of a standardised form of English.  Following [[Great Vowel Shift|a change in vowel pronunciation]] that marks the transition of English from the medieval to the Renaissance period, the language of the Chancery and Caxton became [[Early Modern English]] (the language of [[Shakespeare]]'s day) and with relatively moderate changes eventually developed into the English language of today. [[Scots language|Scots]], as spoken in the lowlands and along the east coast of Scotland, developed largely independent of Modern English, and is based on the Northern dialects of Anglo-Saxon, particularly [[Northumbrian]], which also serve as the basis of Northern English dialects such as those of [[Yorkshire English|Yorkshire]] and [[Geordie|Newcastle upon Tyne]].  Northumbria was within the Danelaw and therefore experienced greater influence from Norse than did the Southern dialects.  As the political influence of London grew, the [[Chancery Standard#Chancery Standard|Chancery]] version of the language developed into a written standard across [[Great Britain]], further progressing in the modern period as [[Scotland]] became united with England as a result of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union of 1707]].\n\nThere have been two introductions of English to [[Ireland]], a medieval introduction that led to the development of the now-extinct [[Yola language|Yola]] dialect and a modern introduction in which [[Hibernian English]] largely replaced [[Irish language|Irish]] as the most widely spoken language during the 19th century, following the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1800]]. [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) is generally viewed as a 19th-century development and is not reflected in [[North American English]] dialects (except the affected [[Transatlantic accent]]), which are based on 18th-century English.\n\nThe establishment of the first permanent English-speaking colony in [[North America]] in 1607 was a major step towards the [[globalisation]] of the language. [[British English]] was only partially standardised when the American colonies were established. Isolated from each other by the Atlantic Ocean, the dialects in England and the colonies began evolving independently.\n\nThe [[First fleet|British colonisation of Australia]] starting in 1788 brought the English language to Oceania. By the 19th century, the standardisation of [[British English]] was more settled than it had been in the previous century, and this relatively well-established English was brought to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It developed both as the language of English-speaking settlers from Britain and Ireland, and as the administrative language imposed on speakers of other languages in the various parts of the [[British Empire]]. The first form can be seen in [[New Zealand English]], and the latter in [[Indian English]]. In [[Europe]], English received a more central role particularly since 1919, when the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was composed not only in [[French language|French]], the common language of diplomacy at the time, but, under special request from American president Woodrow Wilson, also in English - a major milestone in the globalisation of English.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe English-speaking regions of [[Canada]] and the [[Caribbean]] are caught between historical connections with the UK and the Commonwealth and geographical and economic connections with the U.S. In some things they tend to follow British standards, whereas in others, especially commercial, they follow the U.S. standard.\n\n== English as a global language ==\n{{See also|World Englishes}}\n[[Braj Kachru]] divides the use of English into three concentric circles.\n\nThe ''inner circle'' is the traditional base of English and includes countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the anglophone populations of the former British colonies of the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], and various islands of the [[Caribbean]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nIn the ''outer circle'' are those countries where English has official or historical importance (\"special significance\"). This includes most of the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (the former British Empire), including populous countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Nigeria]]; and others, such as the [[Philippines]], under the sphere of influence of English-speaking countries. Here English may serve as a useful [[lingua franca]] between ethnic and language groups. [[Higher education]], the legislature and judiciary, national commerce, and so on, may all be carried out predominantly in English.\n\nThe ''expanding circle'' refers to those countries where English has no official role, but is nonetheless important for certain functions, e.g. international business and tourism. By the twenty-first century, non-native English speakers have come to outnumber native speakers by a factor of three, according to the British Council.<ref>Graddol, David. 2006. English Next.

Asian EFL Journal, Volume 7. Issue 3\nArticle 6.</ref>\n\nSeveral models of \"simplified English\" have been suggested for teaching English as a foreign language:\n*[[Basic English]], developed by [[Charles Kay Ogden]] (and later also [[I. A. Richards]]) in the 1930s; a recent revival has been initiated by Bill Templer\n*Threshold Level English, developed by van Ek and Alexander\n*[[Globish (Nerriere)|Globish]], developed by Jean-Paul Nerri\u00e8re\n*Basic Global English, developed by [[Joachim Grzega]]\nFurthermore, [[Randolph Quirk]] and Gabriele Stein thought about a Nuclear English, which, however, has never been fully developed.\n\nWith reference to the term \"Globish\", Robert McCrum has used this to mean \"English as global language\". Jean-Paul Nerriere uses it for a constructed language.\n\n===Basic Global English===\nBasic Global English, or BGE, is a concept of global English initiated by German linguist [[Joachim Grzega]]. It evolved from the idea of creating a type of English that can be learned more easily than regular British or American English and that serves as a tool for successful global communication. BGE is guided by creating \"empathy and tolerance\" between speakers in a global context. This applies to the context of global communication, where different speakers with different mother tongues come together. BGE aims to develop this competence as quickly as possible.\n\nEnglish language teaching is almost always related to a corresponding culture, e. g. learners will either deal with American English and therefore with American culture or British English and therefore with British culture. Basic Global English is supposed to solve this problem by creating one collective version of English. Additionally, it is a system that is suited for self-teaching as well as regular teaching.\n\nBGE is based on 20 elementary grammar rules that provide a certain degree of variation. For example, regular as well as irregular formed verbs are accepted. Pronunciation rules are not as strict as in British or American English, so there is a certain degree of variation for the learners. Exceptions that cannot be used are pronunciations that would be harmful to mutual understanding and therefore minimize the success of communication.\n\nBasic Global English is based on a 750-word vocabulary. Additionally, every learner has to acquire the knowledge of 250 additional words. These words can be chosen freely, according to the specific needs and interests of the learner.\n\nBGE provides not only basic language skills, but also so called \"Basic Politeness Strategies\". These include creating a positive atmosphere, accepting an offer with \"Yes, please\" or refusing with \"No, thank you\", and small talk topics to choose and to avoid.\n\nBasic Global English has been tested in two elementary schools in Germany. For the practical test of BGE, 12 lessons were prepared in order to cover half of a school year. After the BGE teaching, students were able to answer questions about themselves, their family, their hobbies etc. Additionally they were able to form questions themselves about the same topics. Besides that, they also learned the numbers from 1 to 31 and vocabulary including things in their school bag and in their classroom. The students as well as the parents had a positive impression of the project.\n\n== Varying concepts ==\n\n=== Universality and flexibility ===\n\nInternational English sometimes refers to English as it is actually being used and developed in the world; as a language owned not just by native speakers, but by all those who come to use it.\n<blockquote>Basically, it covers the English language at large, often (but not always or necessarily) implicitly seen as standard. It is certainly also commonly used in connection with the acquisition, use, and study of English as the world's lingua franca ('TEIL: Teaching English as an International Language'), and especially when the language is considered as a whole in contrast with ''British English'', ''American English'', ''South African English'', and the like. &mdash;&nbsp;McArthur (2002, p.&nbsp;444&ndash;445)</blockquote>\nIt especially means English words and phrases generally understood throughout the English-speaking world as opposed to localisms. The importance of non-native English language skills can be recognised behind the long-standing joke that the international language of science and technology is [[broken English]].\n\n=== Neutrality ===\n\nInternational English reaches toward cultural neutrality. This has a practical use:\n<blockquote>What could be better than a type of English that saves you from having to re-edit publications for individual regional markets! Teachers and learners of English as a second language also find it an attractive idea&nbsp;&mdash; both often concerned that their English should be neutral, without American or British or Canadian or Australian coloring. Any regional variety of English has a set of political, social and cultural connotations attached to it, even the so-called 'standard' forms.<ref name=\"peters\">{{cite web | url=http://www.commissionedwriting.com/THE%20CAMBRIDGE%20GUIDE%20TO%20ENGLISH%20USAGE%20PAM%20PETERS.pdf | title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2004 | accessdate=7 March 2014 | author=Peters, Pam | pages=299 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307011713/http://www.commissionedwriting.com/THE%20CAMBRIDGE%20GUIDE%20TO%20ENGLISH%20USAGE%20PAM%20PETERS.pdf | archive-date=7 March 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\nAccording to this viewpoint, International English is a concept of English that minimises the aspects defined by either the colonial [[imperialism]] of [[Victorian Britain]] or the [[cultural imperialism]] of the 20th century [[United States]]. While British [[colonialism]] laid the foundation for English over much of the world, International English is a product of an emerging world culture, very much attributable to the influence of the United States as well, but conceptually based on a far greater degree of cross-talk and linguistic transculturation, which tends to mitigate both U.S. influence and British colonial influence.\n\nThe development of International English often centres on [[academia|academic]] and [[scientific community|scientific communitie]]s, where formal English usage is prevalent, and creative use of the language is at a minimum. This formal International English allows entry into [[Western culture]] as a whole and Western cultural [[values]] in general.\n\n=== Opposition ===\nThe continued growth of the English language itself is seen by authors such as Alistair Pennycook<ref>English and the Discourse of Colonialism. (1998) London: Routledge</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2014}} as a kind of [[cultural imperialism]], whether it is English in one form or English in two slightly different forms.\n\n[[Robert Phillipson]] argues against the possibility of such neutrality in his ''[[Linguistic Imperialism]]'' (1992).{{Clarify|which possibility of neutrality?|date=August 2009}} Learners who wish to use purportedly correct English are in fact faced with the dual standard of American English and British English, and other less known standard Englishes (including Australian, Scottish and Canadian).\n\nEdward Trimnell, author of ''Why You Need a Foreign Language & How to Learn One'' (2005) argues that the international version of English is only adequate for communicating basic ideas. For complex discussions and business/technical situations, English is not an adequate communication tool for non-native speakers of the language. Trimnell also asserts that native English-speakers have become \"dependent on the language skills of others\" by placing their faith in international English.\n\n=== Appropriation theory ===\nThere are also some who reject both linguistic imperialism and [[David Crystal]]'s theory of the neutrality of English. They argue that the phenomenon of the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] (e.g. Spichtinger 2000), that is, English used for local purposes around the world. Demonstrators in non-English speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV-audiences around the globe, for instance.\n\nIn English-language teaching Bobda shows how [[Cameroon]] has moved away from a mono-cultural, Anglo-centered way of teaching English and has gradually appropriated teaching material to a Cameroonian context. Non-Western topics treated are, for instance, the rule of Emirs, traditional medicine or polygamy (1997:225). Kramsch and Sullivan (1996) describe how Western methodology and textbooks have been appropriated to suit local [[Vietnamese culture]]. The [[Pakistan]]i textbook \"Primary Stage English\" includes lessons such as \"Pakistan My Country\", \"Our Flag\", or \"Our Great Leader\" (Malik 1993: 5,6,7) which might well sound jingoistic to Western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between English Language Teaching (ELT), patriotism and Muslim faith is seen as one of the aims of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: \"The board ... takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the students] home lands\" (Punjab Text Book Board 1997).\n\n=== Many Englishes ===\nThere are many difficult choices that have to be made if there is to be further standardisation of English in the future. These include the choice over whether to adopt a current standard, or move towards a more neutral, but artificial one. A true International English might supplant both current American and British English as a variety of English for international communication, leaving these as local dialects, or would rise from a merger of General American and standard British English with admixture of other varieties of English and would generally replace all these varieties of English.\n<blockquote>We may, in due course, all need to be in control of two standard Englishes&mdash;the one which gives us our national and local identity, and the other which puts us in touch with the rest of the human race. In effect, we may all need to become bilingual in our own language. &mdash;&nbsp;David Crystal (1988: p.&nbsp;265)</blockquote>\nThis is the situation long faced by many users of English who possess a \"non-standard\" dialect of English as their birth tongue but have also learned to write (and perhaps also speak) a more standard dialect. (This phenomenon is known in linguistics as ''[[diglossia]]''.) Many academics often publish material in journals requiring different varieties of English and change style and spellings as necessary without great difficulty.\n\nAs far as spelling is concerned, the differences between American and British usage became noticeable due to the first influential [[lexicographers]] (dictionary writers) on each side of the Atlantic. [[Samuel Johnson]]'s dictionary of 1755 greatly favoured Norman-influenced spellings such as ''centre'' and ''colour''; on the other hand, [[Noah Webster]]'s first guide to American spelling, published in 1783, preferred spellings like ''center'' and the Latinate ''color''. The difference in strategy and philosophy of Johnson and Webster are largely responsible for the main division in English spelling that exists today.  However, these differences are extremely minor. Spelling is but a small part of the differences between [[dialects]] of English, and may not even reflect dialect differences at all (except in phonetically spelled dialogue). International English refers to much more than an agreed spelling pattern.\n\n=== Dual standard ===\n\nTwo approaches to International English are the individualistic and inclusive approach and the new dialect approach.\n\nThe individualistic approach gives control to individual authors to write and spell as they wish (within purported standard conventions) and to accept the validity of differences. The ''Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English'', published in 1999, is a descriptive study of both American and British English in which each chapter follows individual spelling conventions according to the preference of the main editor of that chapter.\n\nThe new dialect approach appears in ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'' (Peters, 2004), which attempts to avoid any language bias and accordingly uses an idiosyncratic international spelling system of mixed American and British forms (but tending to prefer the American English spellings).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge guide to literature in English|last=Head|first=Dominick|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cambridge UK|pages=20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|English language}}\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[African English]]\n* [[Business English]]\n* [[English as a second or foreign language]]\n* [[English for specific purposes]]\n* [[English-medium education]]\n* [[Euro English]]\n* [[International auxiliary language]]\n* [[Translanguaging]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Acar, A.

IGFs are part of a [[complex system]] that cells use to communicate with their [[physiology|physiologic]] environment. This complex system (often referred to as the IGF \"axis\") consists of two [[cell-surface receptor]]s (IGF1R and IGF2R), two [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s ([[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) and [[Insulin-like growth factor 2]] (IGF-2)), a family of six high-affinity [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGF-binding proteins]] (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6), as well as associated [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGFBP]] degrading [[enzyme]]s, referred to collectively as [[protease]]s.\n\n== IGF1/GH Axis ==\n\nThe IGF \"axis\" is also commonly referred to as the Growth Hormone/IGF-1 Axis. [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1, or sometimes with a [[Roman numeral]] as IGF-I) is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by [[growth hormone]] (GH). IGF-1 is important for both the regulation of normal physiology, as well as a number of pathological states, including [[cancer]]. The IGF axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of [[cell proliferation]] and the inhibition of [[cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]). [[Insulin-like growth factor 2]] (IGF-2, or sometimes as IGF-II) is thought to be a primary [[growth factor]] required for early development while [[IGF-1]] expression is required for achieving maximal growth. [[Gene knockout]] studies in mice have confirmed this, though other animals are likely to regulate the expression of these genes in distinct ways. While IGF-2 may be primarily [[fetus|fetal]] in action it is also essential for development and function of organs such as the [[brain]], [[liver]], and [[kidney]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nFactors that are thought to cause variation in the levels of GH and IGF-1 in the circulation include an individual's genetic make-up, the time of day, age, sex, exercise status, stress levels, nutrition level, [[body mass index]] (BMI), disease state, race, estrogen status, and [[xenobiotic]] intake.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIGF-1 has an involvement in regulating [[neural development]] including [[neurogenesis]], [[myelination]], [[synaptogenesis]], and [[Dendrite|dendritic]] branching and [[neuroprotection]] after neuronal damage. Increased serum levels of IGF-I in children have been associated with higher [[IQ]].<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Gunnell, David | last2 = Miller | first2 = LL | last3 = Rogers | first3 = I | last4 = Holly | first4 = JM | last5 = Alspac Study | first5 = Team | title = Association of Insulin-like Growth Factor I and Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein-3 with Intelligence Quotient Among 8- to 9-Year-Old Children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/116/5/e681 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = e681 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16263982 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2390 }}</ref>\n\nIGF-1 shapes the development of the [[cochlea]] through controlling [[apoptosis]].

The [[IGF-1 receptor]] is the \"physiological\" receptor\u2014[[IGF-1]] binds to it at significantly higher affinity than it binds the insulin receptor.  Like the insulin receptor, the IGF-1 receptor is a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]\u2014meaning the receptor signals by causing the addition of a phosphate molecule on particular tyrosines. The IGF-2 receptor only binds IGF-2 and acts as a \"clearance receptor\"\u2014it activates no intracellular signaling pathways, functioning only as an IGF-2 sequestering agent and preventing IGF-2 signaling.\n\n==Organs and tissues affected by IGF-1==\n\nSince many distinct tissue types express the [[IGF-1 receptor]], IGF-1's effects are diverse.   It acts as a [[neurotrophic]] factor, inducing the survival of neurons.  It may catalyse [[skeletal muscle]] [[hypertrophy]], by inducing [[protein synthesis]], and by blocking [[muscle atrophy]].  It is protective for [[cartilage]] cells, and is associated with activation of [[osteocytes]], and thus may be an anabolic factor for [[bone]].   Since at high concentrations it is capable of activating the [[insulin receptor]], it can also complement for the effects of [[insulin]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Receptors for IGF-1 are found in vascular smooth muscle, while typical receptors for insulin are not found in vascular smooth muscle.<ref>Bornfeldt KE1, Arnqvist HJ, Dahlkvist HH, Skottner A, Wikberg JE.Receptors for insulin-like growth factor-I in plasma membranes isolated from bovine mesenteric arteries.Acta Endocrinol (Copenh). 1988 Apr;117(4):428-34.</ref>\n\n== IGF-Binding Proteins ==\n\nIGF-1 and IGF-2 are regulated by a family of proteins known as the [[Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein|IGF-Binding Proteins]].  These proteins help to modulate IGF action in complex ways that involve both inhibiting IGF action by preventing binding to the IGF-1 receptor as well as promoting IGF action possibly through aiding in delivery to the receptor and increasing IGF half-life.  Currently, there are six characterized IGF Binding Proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6).  There is currently significant data suggesting that IGFBPs play important roles in addition to their ability to regulate IGFs. \nIGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are GH dependent, whereas IGFBP-1 is insulin regulated.\nIGFBP-1 production from the liver is significantly elevated during insulinopenia while serum levels of bioactive IGF-1 is increased by insulin.\n\n== Diseases affected by IGF ==\n\nStudies of recent interest show that the Insulin/IGF axis play an important role in [[Senescence|aging]].<ref name=\"The genetics of ageing\">{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=Cynthia J.|title=The genetics of ageing|journal=Nature|date=25 March 2010|volume=464|issue=7288|pages=504\u2013512|doi=10.1038/nature08980|pmid=20336132}}</ref> [[Nematode]]s, [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit-flies]], and other organisms have an increased life span when the gene equivalent to the mammalian insulin is [[Gene knockout|knocked out]].

Therefore, it is an open question as to whether either IGF-1 or insulin in the mammal may perturb aging, although there is the suggestion that dietary restriction phenomena may be related.\n\nOther studies are beginning to uncover the important role the IGFs play in diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]], showing for instance that IGF-1 stimulates growth of both prostate and breast cancer cells.

The most common intersection between these two categories of mental impairment occurs in the polemic surrounding Edmund from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]''.\n\nIn [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Idiot]]'' the title refers to the central character [[Prince Myshkin]], a man whose innocence, kindness and humility, combined with his occasional epileptic symptoms, cause many in the corrupt, egoistic culture around him to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence.

From the perspective of political Islam, the Salafi movement can be broadly categorized into three groups; the [[Political quietism in Islam#Salafists|quietist]] (or the purist), the activist (or ''haraki'') and the jihadist ([[Salafi jihadism]], see below). The quietist school advocates for societal reform through religious education and proselytizing rather than political activism. The activist school, to the contrary, encourages political participation within the constitutional and political framework. The jihadist school is inspired by the ideology of [[Sayyid Qutb]] ([[Qutbism]], see below), and rejects the legitimacy of secular institutions and promotes the revolution in order to pave the way for the establishment of a new [[Caliphate]].<ref name=\"Mo\">Mohie-Eldin, Fatima. ''The Evolution of Salafism A History of Salafi Doctrine''. Al-Noor, Fall 2015. pp. 44-47.</ref>\n\nThe quietist Salafi movement is stemming from the teaching of [[Nasiruddin Albani]], who challenged the notion of ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation, conformity to the legal precedent) as a blind adherence. As such, they alarm the political participation as potentially leading to the division of the Muslim community.<ref name=\"Mo\"/> This school is exemplified by [[Madkhalism]] which based on the writings of [[Rabee al-Madkhali]].<ref>Omayma Abdel-Latif, \"Trends in Salafism.\" Taken from ''Islamist Radicalisation: The Challenge for Euro-Mediterranean Relations'', p. 74.

In a major shock to the rest of the world, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] led the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in order to overthrow the oil-rich, well-armed, Westernized and pro-American secular monarchy ruled by Shah [[Muhammad Reza Pahlavi]].\n\nThe views of [[Ali Shariati]], the ideologue of the [[Iranian Revolution]], resembled those of [[Mohammad Iqbal]], the ideological father of the [[State of Pakistan]], but Khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of Shia Islam and the beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb. He believed that complete imitation of the [[Prophet Mohammad]] and his successors such as [[Ali]] for the restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West and therefore serving Western interests, and that acts such as the \"plundering\" of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by Western governments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Khomeini (1981), p. 54</ref>\n\nHis views differed from those of Sunni scholars in:\n* As a [[Shia]],  Khomeini looked to [[Ali]] ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] Imam, but not Caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|Omar]] or [[Uthman]].\n* Khomeini talked not about restoring the [[Caliphate]] or [[Sunni]] [[Islamic democracy]], but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or  the dictatorial political system was performed by Shia jurists (''[[ulama]]'') as the successors of [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|Shia Imams]] until the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] returns from [[occultation]]. His concept of ''[[velayat-e-faqih]]'' (\"guardianship of the [Islamic] jurist\"), held that the leading Shia Muslim cleric in society\u2014which Khomeini's mass of followers believed and chose to be himself\u2014should serve as the supervisor of the state in order to protect or \"guard\" Islam and ''Sharia'' law from \"innovation\" and \"anti-Islamic laws\" passed by dictators or democratic parliaments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nThe revolution was influenced by [[Marxism]] through Islamist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter Marxism ([[Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr]]'s work) or to integrate socialism and Islamism  ([[Ali Shariati]]'s work). A strong wing of the revolutionary leadership was made up of leftists or \"radical populists\", such as [[Ali Akbar Mohtashami-Pur]].<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997) pp. 103, 126</ref>\n\nWhile initial enthusiasm for the Iranian revolution in the Muslim world was intense, it has waned as critics hold and campaign that \"purges, executions, and atrocities tarnished its image\".<ref>Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad,'' Harvard University Press, (2002), p. 118</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of [[United States-Iran relations|US economic sanctions]], and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan ([[SCIRI]])<ref>[[Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq#History]]</ref><ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', Basic Books, (1984), p. 233</ref> and Lebanon ([[Hezbollah]])<ref>\"Hezbollah Terrorist Shia group is coy about revealing the sums it has received from Iran. ...

In 1979 the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] [[Saudi Arabia]] was seized by an armed fundamentalist group and held for over a week. Scores were killed, including many pilgrim bystanders<ref>Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p. 148</ref> in a gross violation of one of the most holy sites in Islam (and one where arms and violence are strictly forbidden).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdialogue.com/m22.htm |title=Masjid-ul-Haram: Sacred and forbidden |publisher=Ourdialogue.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420195838/http://www.ourdialogue.com/m22.htm |archivedate=20 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11''.

Crackdowns followed on everything from shopkeepers who did not close for prayer and newspapers that published pictures of women, to the selling of dolls, teddy bears (images of animate objects are considered [[haraam]]), and dog food (dogs are considered unclean).<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam,'' p. 155</ref>\n\nIn other Muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundamentalists, but against Islamic fundamentalism's foremost geopolitical enemy\u2014the United States. Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] sparked attacks on American embassies when he announced:\n<blockquote>It is not beyond guessing that this is the work of criminal American imperialism and international Zionism</blockquote> despite the fact that the object of the fundamentalists' revolt was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, America's major ally in the region. Anti-American demonstrations followed in the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Kuwait]]. The US Embassy in [[Libya]] was burned by protesters chanting pro-Khomeini slogans and the embassy in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan was burned to the ground.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'', p. 149</ref>\n\n====Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979\u20131989)====\nIn 1979, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan]], attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]]. The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims ([[mujahideen]]) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith.

Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] dictator of neighboring [[Iraq]], attacked Saudi Arabia (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy. Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.\n\nThese attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] pp. 205\u201317</ref>  One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Egypt]], a bloody civil war in [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|Algeria]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]'s terror attacks climaxing in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attack]].<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] p. 207</ref>\n\n===Rise of Islamism by country===\n====Afghanistan (Taliban)====\n[[File:Flag of Taliban.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Taliban]]]]\n{{main|Taliban}}\nIn Afghanistan, the mujahideen's victory against the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity, due to a vicious and destructive [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] between political and tribal warlords, making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth. In 1992, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] ruled by communist forces collapsed, and [[Islamic democracy|democratic Islamist]] elements of mujahdeen founded the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]. In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the [[Taliban]] rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban were spawned by the thousands of [[madrasah]]s the [[Deobandi]] movement established for impoverished [[Afghan refugees]] and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp. 26, 32</ref> The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading \"an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs\" under the label of Sharia to an entire country.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/447 Is Islamism a Threat?

Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by [[Abbassi Madani]], and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, [[Ali Belhadj]]. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men. The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nAs Islamists took up arms to overthrow the government, the FIS's leaders were arrested and it became overshadowed by Islamist guerrilla groups, particularly the [[Islamic Salvation Army]], MIA and [[Armed Islamic Group]] (or GIA). A bloody and devastating [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] ensued in which between 150,000 and 200,000 people were killed over the next decade.\n\nThe civil war was not a victory for Islamists. By 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or had surrendered. The popularity of Islamist parties has declined to the point that \"the Islamist candidate, Abdallah Jaballah, came a distant third with 5% of the vote\" in the 2004 presidential election.<ref>\"International: Freer and more peaceful; An election in Algeria,\" ''The Economist'', April 17, 2004.

Ali Bhutto, a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists, had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months, shortly before he was overthrown.<ref>''Asian Survey'', 6, n. 29, William L. Richter, \"The Political Dynamics of Islamic Resurgence in Pakistan.\"</ref> Zia-ul-Haq was much more committed to Islamism, and \"[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]]\" or implementation of Islamic law, became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and Islamism became his \"official state ideology\". Zia ul Haq was an admirer of [[Mawdudi]] and Mawdudi's party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] became the \"regime's ideological and political arm\".<ref>Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), pp. 98, 100\u201301</ref> In Pakistan this Islamization from above was \"probably\" more complete \"than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan,\" but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing \"symbols\" rather than substance, and using Islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power.<ref>Fuller, ''Future of Political Islam'', (2003), p. 131</ref> Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intended to \"avoid revolutionary excess\", and not to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies.<ref>Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), p. 98</ref> Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society.\n\n====Sudan====\n{{main|National Islamic Front|National Congress (Sudan)}}\nFor many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. His [[National Islamic Front]] first gained influence when strongman General [[Gaafar al-Nimeiry]] invited members to serve in his government in 1979. Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia. He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.<ref name=\"Fuller, Graham E. 2003 p. 108\"/>\n\nAfter al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections, but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military. Turabi was noted for proclaiming his support for the democratic process and a liberal government before coming to power, but strict application of sharia law, torture and mass imprisonment of the opposition,<ref name=\"Human Rights Watch Report\"/> and an intensification of the long-running war in southern Sudan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Sudan.htm#TopOfPage |title=Human Rights Watch 1989 Sudan |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref> once in power. The NIF regime also harbored [[Osama bin Laden]] for a time (before 9/11), and worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 [[Gulf War]].\n\nAfter Sudanese intelligence services were implicated in an [[Hosni Mubarak#Assassination attempt in Ethiopia|assassination attempt]] on the President of Egypt, UN economic sanctions were imposed on Sudan, a poor country, and Turabi fell from favor.<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Towers'', (2006), pp. 213\u201315</ref> He was imprisoned for a time in 2004\u201305. Some of the NIF policies, such as the war with the non-Muslim south, have been reversed, though the National Islamic Front still holds considerable power in the government of [[Omar al-Bashir]] and [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]], another Islamist party in country.\n\n====Turkey====\n{{POV section|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Necmettin-Erbakan.jpg|thumb|[[Necmettin Erbakan]], was the first Islamist Prime Minister of Turkey elected in 1996, but was removed from power by a [[1997 military memorandum (Turkey)|\"postmodern coup d'\u00e9tat\"]] in 1997.]]\n[[Turkey]] had a number of Islamist parties, often changing names as they were banned by the constitutional court for anti-secular activities.

HT is unique from most other Islamist movements in that the party focuses not on implementation of Sharia on local level or on providing social services, but on unifying the Muslim world under its vision of a new Islamic [[caliphate]] spanning from North Africa and the Middle East to much of central and South Asia.\n\nTo this end it has drawn up and published a 186-article constitution for its proposed caliphate-state specifying specific policies such as sharia law, a \"unitary ruling system\" headed by a caliph elected by Muslims, an economy based on the [[gold standard]], public ownership of utilities, public transport, and energy resources, death for [[murtadd|apostates]] and Arabic as the \"sole language of the State.\"<ref name = \"The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State1\">{{cite book |author=Hizb ut-Tahrir |title=The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State|url=http://www.hizb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Draft-Constitution.pdf |publisher=Khilafah|date=February 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State2\">{{cite web|title=Draft Constitution by Hizb ut-Tahrir|url=http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|publisher=Media Office of Hizb ut-Tahrir|accessdate=29 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200116/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn its focus on the Caliphate, the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as [[Muhammad Qutb]]. HT sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of [[Ali]], or one of the other four [[Rashidun|rightly guided Caliphs]] in the 7th century, but with the [[Caliph#Abolition of the institution|abolition]] of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1924.

Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure, by securing external funding, weaponry and fighters\u2014\"many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity\".

Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [[Rached Ghannouchi]] but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose perpetrators are not just \"individual conspirators but entire social groups\".<ref name=\"osman-2016-244\">{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Tarek|title=Islamism: What It Means for the Middle East and

Worse yet, it turns them into \"containers\", into \"receptacles\" to be \"filled\" by the teacher. The more completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are.\"<ref name=Freire/> In this way he explains educator creates an act of depositing knowledge in a student. The student thus becomes a repository of knowledge. Freire explains that this system that diminishes creativity and knowledge suffers. Knowledge, according to Freire, comes about only through the learner by inquiry and pursuing the subjects in the world and through interpersonal interaction.\n\nFreire further states, \"In the banking concept of [[education]], [[knowledge]] is a gift bestowed by those who consider themselves knowledgeable upon those whom they consider to know nothing. Projecting an absolute ignorance onto others, a characteristic of the ideology of oppression, negates [[education]] and [[knowledge]] as processes of inquiry. The teacher presents himself to his students as their necessary opposite; by considering their ignorance absolute, he justifies his own existence. The students, alienated like the slave in the Hegelian dialectic, accept their ignorance as justifying the teacher's existence\u2014but, unlike the slave, they never discover that they educate the teacher.\"\nFreire then offered an alternative stance and wrote, \"The raison d'etre of libertarian education, on the other hand, lies in its drive towards reconciliation. [[Education]] must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students.\"<ref name=Freire/>\n\nIn the article, \"A process for the critical analysis of instructional theory\", the authors use an ontology-building process to review and analyze concepts across different instructional theories.

The culture will start to proliferate in two to three days, depending on temperature and light received.

ISO 8859-1 encodes what it refers to as \"Latin alphabet no. 1,\" consisting of 191 [[character (computing)|characters]] from the [[Latin script]]. This character-encoding scheme is used throughout the [[Americas]], [[Western Europe]], [[Oceania]], and much of [[Africa]].

It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling.

It was developed within ECMA, the [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]], and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\"/> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7). However, the French delegate, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''). These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

This map assigns the [[C0 and C1 control character]]s to the unassigned code values thus provides for 256 characters via every possible 8-bit value.\n\nISO-8859-1 is (according to the standards at least) the default encoding of documents delivered via [[HTTP]] with a [[MIME type]] beginning with \"text/\" (however the [[HTML5]] specification requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding).<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/#names-and-labels W3C/WHATWG Encoding specification: Names and Labels]</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#encoding-terminology HTML5 specification: 2.1.6 Character encodings]</ref> It is the default encoding of the values of certain descriptive HTTP headers, and defines the repertoire of characters allowed in [[HTML]] 3.2 documents (HTML 4.0, however, is based on [[Unicode]]). This and Windows-1252 are often assumed to be the encoding of text on [[Unix]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in the absence of locale or other information, this is only gradually being replaced with Unicode encoding such as [[UTF-8]] or [[UTF-16]].\n\n== Code page layout ==\n\n{|{{chset-table|ISO/IEC

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984.

The US variant (commonly known as [[ASCII]]) maps exacly to the lower range of ISO/IEC 8859-1: the G0 subset from 32 to 126 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 20 to 7E).\n*'''ISO&nbsp;2022 (1971)''' [[ISO 2022|ISO&nbsp;2022]] is a standard for 7- and 8-bit encodings that can be selected with switch sequences. For example, the Japanese ISO-2022-JP-2 standard specifies the switch sequence {{code|ESC . A}} to select the higher range of 8859-1: the G1 subset from 160 to 255 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] A0 to FF).\n*'''ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode (1991)''' The first 256 code points of [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and [[Unicode]] incorporate ISO-8859-1.\n*'''ISO/IEC 8859-2 (1987) to ISO/IEC 8859-16 (2001)''' Other standards in the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] series support languages that require characters missing from ISO/IEC 8859-1. For example, [[ISO/IEC 8859-9]] replaces ISO/IEC 8859-1's rarely used Icelandic letters with Turkish ones.\n*'''ISO/IEC 8859-15 (1999)''' [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999 as an update of ISO/IEC 8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC 8859-1.  This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in  [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by ISO/IEC 8859-15, plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel text data with the charset label ISO-8859-1, even though the data is really [[Windows-1252]] encoded. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels|title=Encoding Standard|last=WHATWG|first=|authorlink=WHATWG|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-15|section=Names and Labels}}</ref> in order to accommodate such mislabeling and care should be taken to avoid generating these characters in ISO-8859-1 labeled content.\n\n=== Mac-Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called Mac Roman, or [[Mac-Roman]], in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]].  It is a superset of [[ASCII]], like ISO-8859-1, and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 but in a totally different arrangement.  A later version, registered with IANA as \"Macintosh\", replaced the [[Currency (typography)|generic currency sign]] {{code|\u00a4}} with the [[euro sign]] {{code|\u20ac}}. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1 but not in this set are often a source of trouble when editing text on websites using older Macintosh browsers (including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]]). However the extra characters that Windows-1252 has in the C1 code point range are all supported in MacRoman.\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator  --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.

The series of standards consists of numbered parts, such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-2]], etc. There are 15 parts, excluding the abandoned [[ISO/IEC 8859-12]]. The ISO working group maintaining this series of standards has been disbanded.\n\nISO/IEC 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were originally [[Ecma International]] standard '''ECMA-94'''.\n\n==Introduction==\nWhile the bit patterns of the 95 [[graphic character|printable]] [[ASCII]] characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern [[English language|English]], most other languages that use [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]]s need additional symbols not covered by ASCII. ISO/IEC 8859 sought to remedy this problem by utilizing the eighth bit in an 8-bit [[byte]] to allow positions for another 96 printable characters. Early encodings were limited to 7&nbsp;bits because of restrictions of some data transmission protocols, and partially for historical reasons. However, more characters were needed than could fit in a single 8-bit character encoding, so several mappings were developed, including at least ten suitable for various Latin alphabets.\n\nThe ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' encodings only contain printable characters, and were designed to be used in conjunction with [[control characters]] mapped to the unassigned bytes. To this end a series of encodings registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] add the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 0 to 31) from [[ISO/IEC 646|ISO 646]] and the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 128<!-- Character 127, the delete character, does not belong to C1 --> to 159) from [[ISO 6429]], resulting in full 8-bit character maps with most, if not all, bytes assigned. These sets have ISO-8859-''n'' as their preferred [[MIME]] name or, in cases where a preferred MIME name is not specified, their canonical name. Many people use the terms ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' and ISO-8859-''n'' interchangeably. [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] did not get such a charset assigned, presumably because it was almost identical to [[TIS 620]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard is designed for reliable information exchange, not [[typography]]; the standard omits symbols needed for high-quality typography, such as optional ligatures, curly quotation marks, dashes, etc. As a result, high-quality typesetting systems often use proprietary or idiosyncratic extensions on top of the [[ASCII]] and ISO/IEC 8859 standards, or use [[Unicode]] instead.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if a character or symbol was not already part of a widely used data-processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language, it did not get in. Hence the directional double quotation marks ''\u00ab'' and ''\u00bb'' used for some European languages were included, but not the directional double quotation marks ''\u201c'' and ''\u201d'' used for English and some other languages. French did not get its ''\u0153'' and ''\u0152'' ligatures because they could be typed as 'oe'. Likewise, ''\u0178'', needed for all-caps text, was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Haralambous_2007\"/><ref name=\"Andre_2003\"/><ref name=\"Andre_1996\"/> Albeit under different codepoints, these three characters were later reintroduced with [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] in 1999, which also introduced the new [[euro sign]] character \u20ac. Likewise Dutch did not get the ''\u0133'' and ''\u0132'' letters, because Dutch speakers had become used to typing these as two letters instead. Romanian did not initially get its ''\u0218''/''\u0219'' and ''\u021a''/''\u021b'' ([[Comma (punctuation)#Diacritical usage|with comma]]) letters, because these letters were initially unified with ''\u015e''/''\u015f'' and ''\u0162''/''\u0163'' ([[Cedilla|with cedilla]]) by the [[Unicode Consortium]], considering the shapes with comma beneath to be [[glyph]] variants of the shapes with cedilla. However, the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the Unicode standard and are also in [[ISO/IEC 8859-16]].\nMost of the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings provide diacritic marks required for various European languages using the Latin script. Others provide non-Latin alphabets: [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]]. Most of the encodings contain only [[spacing characters]] although the Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic ones do also contain [[combining characters]]. However, the standard makes no provision for the scripts of East Asian languages (''[[CJK]]''), as their ideographic [[writing system]]s require many thousands of code points. Although it uses Latin based characters, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] does not fit into 96 positions (without using combining diacritics) either. Each Japanese syllabic alphabet (hiragana or katakana, see [[Kana]]) would fit, but like several other alphabets of the world they are not encoded in the ISO/IEC 8859 system.\n\n==The parts of ISO/IEC 8859==\nISO/IEC 8859 is divided into the following parts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

These were introduced with Unicode.\n|-\n!

In practice two different encodings exist, logical order (needs to be [[BiDi]] processed for display) and visual (left-to-right) order (in effect, after bidi processing and line breaking).\n|-\n!

Considered more useful for Nordic languages. Baltic languages use Latin-4 more.\n|-\n! [[ISO/IEC 8859-11|Part&nbsp;11]]\n| ''Latin/Thai''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-11:2001|2001]]\n| Contains characters needed for the [[Thai language]].

[[ISO/IEC 8859-13|Part&nbsp;13]]\n| ''Latin-7'' <br/>''Baltic Rim''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-13:1998|1998]]\n| Added some characters for Baltic languages which were missing from Latin-4 and Latin-6.\n|-\n! [[ISO/IEC 8859-14|Part&nbsp;14]]\n| ''Latin-8'' <br/>''Celtic''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-14:1998|1998]]\n| Covers Celtic languages such as [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and the [[Breton language]].\n|-\n! [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|Part&nbsp;15]]\n| ''Latin-9''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-15:1999|1999]]\n| A revision of 8859-1 that removes some little-used symbols, replacing them with the [[euro sign]] ''\u20ac'' and the letters ''\u0160'', ''\u0161'', ''\u017d'', ''\u017e'', ''\u0152'', ''\u0153'', and ''\u0178'', which completes the coverage of [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].\n|-\n! [[ISO/IEC 8859-16|Part&nbsp;16]]\n| ''Latin-10'' <br/>''South-Eastern European''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-16:2001|2001]]\n| Intended for [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], but also Finnish, French, German and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] (new orthography). The focus lies more on letters than symbols. The [[Currency (typography)|currency sign]] is replaced with the [[euro sign]].\n|}\n\nEach part of ISO/IEC 8859 is designed to support languages that often borrow from each other, so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part. However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all of its seven special characters at the same positions in all Latin variants (1\u20134, 9, 10, 13\u201316), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets. In particular, variants 1\u20134 were designed jointly, and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Newer editions of ISO/IEC 8859 express characters in terms of their Unicode/UCS names and the ''U+nnnn'' notation, effectively causing each part of ISO/IEC 8859 to be a Unicode/UCS character encoding scheme that maps a very small subset of the UCS to single 8-bit bytes. The first 256 characters in Unicode and the UCS are identical to those in ISO/IEC-8859-1 ([[Latin-1]]).\n\nSingle-byte character sets including the parts of ISO/IEC 8859 and derivatives of them were favoured throughout the 1990s, having the advantages of being well-established and more easily implemented in software: the equation of one byte to one character is simple and adequate for most single-language applications, and there are no combining characters or variant forms. As Unicode-enabled operating systems became more widespread, ISO/IEC 8859 and other legacy encodings became less popular. While remnants of ISO 8859 and single-byte character models remain entrenched in many operating systems, programming languages, data storage systems, networking applications, display hardware, and end-user application software, most modern computing applications use Unicode internally, and rely on conversion tables to map to and from other encodings, when necessary.\n\n==Development status==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard was maintained by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 2, Working Group 3 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3). In June 2004, WG 3 disbanded, and maintenance duties were transferred to [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2|SC 2]]. The standard is not currently being updated, as the Subcommittee's only remaining [[working group]], WG 2, is concentrating on development of Unicode's [[Universal Coded Character Set]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of computer character sets]]\n* [[RPL character set]] (An ISO 8859-1 superset on HP calculators, referred to as \"ECMA-94\" as well)\n* [[DEC Multinational Character Set]] (MCS)\n* [[DEC National Replacement Character Set]] (NRCS)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Missing_vowels\">Missing several accented vowels including ''[[\u00d8|\u01fe]]'' and ''\u01ff''.

The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700&nbsp;nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR [[laser]]s, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780&nbsp;nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050&nbsp;nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination).

Unlike heat transmitted by [[thermal conduction]] or [[thermal convection]], thermal radiation can propagate through a [[vacuum]]. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the [[solar corona]]). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.\n\nThe concept of [[emissivity]] is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a [[black body]]. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2007}}\n\n===Night vision===\n{{Main|Night vision}}\n[[File:Active-Infrared-Night-Vision.jpg|thumb|Active-infrared night vision : the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the [[human eye]].

This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed [[pyrometry]]. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs.\n\n[[Thermographic cameras]] detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900\u201314,000 nanometers or 0.9\u201314&nbsp;\u03bcm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the [[black body]] radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \"see\" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).\n\n===Hyperspectral imaging===\n{{Main|Hyperspectral imaging}}\n\n[[File:Specim aisaowl outdoor.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7| Hyperspectral thermal infrared [[Emission spectrum|emission]] measurement, an outdoor scan in winter conditions, ambient temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, image produced with a [[Specim]] LWIR hyperspectral imager.

Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.\n\nThermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a [[Thermographic camera]], with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor surveillance and [[UAV]] applications.<ref name=\"Frost&Sullivan Specim Owl\">Frost&Sullivan, Technical Insights, Aerospace&Defence (Feb 2011): [http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/segment-toc.pag?segid=D870-00-48-00-00&ctxixpLink=FcmCtx3&ctxixpLabel=FcmCtx4 World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]</ref>\n\n===Other imaging===\nIn [[infrared photography]], [[infrared filter]]s are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. [[Digital camera]]s often use infrared [[Filter (optics)|blockers]]. Cheaper digital cameras and [[camera phones]] have less effective filters and can \"see\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called '[[Terahertz radiation|T-ray]]' imaging, which is imaging using [[far-infrared]] or [[terahertz radiation]]. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].\n[[File:Infrared portrait comparison.jpg|thumb|Reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes.]]\n\n===Tracking===\n{{Main|Infrared homing}}\nInfrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a [[Passive homing|passive missile guidance system]], which uses the [[light emission|emission]] from a target of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the infrared part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \"heat-seekers\", since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mahulikar, S.P. |author2=Sonawane, H.R. |author3=Rao, G.A.|year=2007|title=Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|volume=43|issue=7\u20138|pages= 218\u2013245|url=http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/613/5740.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2007.06.002|bibcode = 2007PrAeS..43..218M |citeseerx=10.1.1.456.9135 }}</ref>\n\n===Heating===\n{{Main|Infrared heating}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nInfrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).<ref>White, Richard P. (2000) \"Infrared deicing system for aircraft\" {{US Patent|6092765}}</ref> Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around them.\n\nInfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.\n\nEfficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material.\n\n===Cooling===\n{{Main|Radiative cooling}}\nA variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere.\n\n===Communications===\n{{Further|Consumer IR}}\n\nIR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and [[personal digital assistant]]s. These devices usually conform to standards published by [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] into a narrow beam. The beam is [[modulation|modulated]], i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a [[silicon]] [[photodiode]] to convert the infrared radiation to an [[electric current]]. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for [[remote control]]s to command appliances.\nInfrared remote control protocols like [[RC-5]], [[Sony Infrared Remote Control|SIRC]], are used to communicate with infrared.\n\n[[Free space optical communication]] using infrared [[laser]]s can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage. \"Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.\"<ref>[http://www.ishn.com/articles/94815-dangers-of-overexposure-to-ultraviolet-infrared-and-high-energy-visible-light Dangers of Overexposure to ultraviolet, infrared and high-energy visible light | 2013-01-03]. ISHN. Retrieved on 2017-04-26.</ref>\n\nInfrared lasers are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330&nbsp;nm (least [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]) or 1,550&nbsp;nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.\n\nIR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]] project.\nTransmitting IR data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as [[beaming]].\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n[[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared vibrational spectroscopy]] (see also [[near-infrared spectroscopy]]) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH<sub>2</sub>) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in [[dipole]] in the molecule then it will absorb a [[photon]] that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study [[organic compound]]s using light radiation from 4000\u2013400&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\n===Thin film metrology===\nIn the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations]]. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.\n\n===Meteorology===\n[[File:US IR satpic.JPG|thumb|left| IR Satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15th October 2006. A [[weather front|frontal]] system can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with embedded Cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower Cumulus and Stratocumulus can be seen off the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].]]\n[[Weather satellite]]s equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3\u201312.5&nbsp;\u00b5m (IR4 and IR5 channels).\n\nHigh, cold ice clouds such as [[Cirrus cloud|Cirrus]] or [[Cumulonimbus]] show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as [[Stratus cloud|Stratus]] or [[Stratocumulus]] show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or [[fog]] can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3\u201311.5&nbsp;\u00b5m) and the near-infrared channel (1.58\u20131.64&nbsp;\u00b5m), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a ''fog'' satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.\n\nThese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even [[El Ni\u00f1o]] phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.\n\nThe main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08&nbsp;\u00b5m can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Climatology===\nIn the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into [[global warming]], together with [[solar radiation]].\n[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.55|Schematic of the [[greenhouse effect]]]]\n\nA [[pyrgeometer]] is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5&nbsp;\u00b5m and 50&nbsp;\u00b5m.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main|Infrared astronomy|far-infrared astronomy}}\n[[File:ESO - Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged (by).jpg|thumb|[[Beta Pictoris]] with its planet Beta Pictoris b, the light-blue dot off-center, as seen in infrared. It combines two images, the inner disc is at 3.6&nbsp;\u00b5m.]]\nAstronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of [[optical astronomy]]. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid [[helium]].\n\nThe sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected [[Infrared window|atmospheric window]]s. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.\n\nThe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark [[molecular cloud]]s of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect [[protostar]]s before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as [[planet]]s can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)\n\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of [[active galaxy|active galaxies]], which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high [[redshift]] will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.<ref name=\"ir_astronomy\" />\n\n===Infrared cleaning===\n[[Infrared cleaning]] is a technique used by some [[motion picture film scanner]]s, [[film scanner]]s and [[flatbed scanner]]s to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished [[image scanning|scan]]. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by [[inpainting]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110107163528/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/dice.htm Digital ICE]. kodak.com</ref>\n\n===Art conservation and analysis===\n[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]]]]\n[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|frameless|right|upright=0.9]]\n{{Interlanguage link multi|Infrared reflectography|2=fr|3=r\u00e9flectographie infrarouge|4=it|5=Riflettografia|6=es|7=Reflectograf\u00eda infrarroja|preserve=1}}, as called by art conservators,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sensorsinc.com/artanalysis.html |title=IR Reflectography for Non-destructive Analysis of Underdrawings in Art Objects |publisher=Sensors Unlimited, Inc. |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner, in particular the [[underdrawing]] or outline drawn by the artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of [[carbon black]], which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between \u2013 such alterations are called [[pentimento|pentimenti]] when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the [[prime version]] by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |title=The Mass of Saint Gregory: Examining a Painting Using Infrared Reflectography |publisher=The Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref>\n\nAmong many other changes in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 (left), the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.

An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such it is one of the [[Archimedean solid]]s and more particularly, a [[quasiregular polyhedron]].\n\n== Geometry==\nAn icosidodecahedron has icosahedral symmetry, and its first [[stellation]] is the compound of a [[dodecahedron]] and its dual [[icosahedron]], with the vertices of the icosidodecahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.\n\nIts [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[rhombic triacontahedron]]. An icosidodecahedron can be split along any of six planes to form a pair of [[pentagonal rotunda]]e, which belong among the [[Johnson solid]]s.\n\nThe icosidodecahedron can be considered a [[#Pentagonal gyrobirotunda|''pentagonal gyrobirotunda'']], as a combination of two [[pentagonal rotunda|rotundae]] (compare [[pentagonal orthobirotunda]], one of the [[Johnson solid]]s). In this form its symmetry is [[Dihedral symmetry|D<sub>5d</sub>]], [10,2<sup>+</sup>], (2*5), order 20.\n\nThe [[wire-frame figure]] of the icosidodecahedron consists of six [[decagon|flat regular decagons]], meeting in pairs at each of the 30 vertices.\n\nThe icosidodecahedron has 6 central [[decagon]]s. Projected into a sphere, they define 6 [[great circle]]s. [[Buckminster Fuller]] used these 6 great circles, along with 15 and 10 others in two other polyhedra to define his [[31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron]].\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\nConvenient [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of an icosidodecahedron with unit edges are given by the [[even permutation]]s of:<ref>{{mathworld |title=Icosahedral group |urlname=IcosahedralGroup}}</ref>\n*(0, 0, \u00b1''\u03c6'')\n*(\u00b1{{sfrac|1|2}}, \u00b1{{sfrac|''\u03c6''|2}}, \u00b1{{sfrac|''\u03c6''<sup>2</sup>|2}})\nwhere ''\u03c6'' is the [[golden ratio]], {{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}}.\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\nThe icosidodecahedron has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered on a vertex, an edge, a triangular face, and a pentagonal face.

The wire frame figure of the 600-cell consists of 72 flat regular decagons. Six of these are the equatorial decagons to a pair of opposite vertices.

Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and certain characters (such as \"-\", \":\", \"T\", \"W\", and \"Z\") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as \"January\" or \"Thursday\", are not allowed in interchange representations.\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Date and time expressed according to ISO 8601 <small>[{{purge|refresh}}]</small>\n|-\n| '''Date''' || {{ISO date}}\n|-\n| '''Date and time in [[UTC]]''' || {{#time:c}}<br />{{#time: Y-m-d\"T\"H:i:s\"Z\"}}<br />{{#time: Ymd\"T\"His\"Z\"}}\n|-\n| '''Week''' || {{#time: o-\"W\"W}}\n|-\n| '''Date with week number''' || {{#time: o-\"W\"W-N}}\n|-\n| '''Date without year''' || {{#time: --m-d }}<ref>last in ISO8601:2000, in use by {{cite web\n |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1\n |title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification\n |accessdate=2016-06-29\n |date=August 2011\n |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''Ordinal date''' || {{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{padleft:{{#expr:{{#time: z}}+1}}|3}}\n|}\n\n==History==\nThe first edition of the ISO 8601 standard was published as ''ISO&nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988.

The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.\n*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.\n*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a basic format with a minimal number of separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.<ref name=isofaqtnd>ISO, FAQ: ''[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 Numeric representation of Dates and Time]''</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime \"Date and Time Formats\"].</ref> The standard notes that \"The basic format should be avoided in plain text.\"<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format</ref> The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).<!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--> For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|\"2009-01-06\"}} in the extended format or simply as \"20090106\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\n*For reduced accuracy,<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision>ISO 8601 uses the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.</ref> any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant.  For example, \"2004-05\" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004.  This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.\n*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.\n\n==Dates==\n{{ISOCALENDAR}}\nThe standard uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], which serves as an international standard for civil use.<ref>{{cite book\n |url=http://astro.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html\n |last=Doggett\n |first=L.

However, ISO calendar dates before the Convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on {{nowrap|1582-10-15}}. Earlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).\n\n===Years===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| YYYY\n|-\n| \u00b1<u>Y</u>YYYY\n|}\nISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]]. However, years prior to [[Gregorian calendar|1583]] are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead \"values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|at=section 4.1.2.1 General\n}}</ref>\n\nTo represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.<ref>{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=3.5 Expansion ... By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, it is permitted to expand the component identifying the calendar year, which is otherwise limited to four digits.

[YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31.  For example, \"5 April 1981\" may be represented as either {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}}<ref name=isofaqtnd/> in the ''extended format'' or \"19810405\" in the ''basic format''.\n\nThe standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced accuracy.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/> For example, one may write {{nowrap|\"1981-04\"}} to mean \"1981 April\". The 2000 version allowed writing {{nowrap|\"--04-05\"}} to mean \"April 5\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1\n |title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification\n |accessdate=2016-06-29\n |date=August 2011\n |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}</ref> but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present. One may simply write \"1981\" to refer to that year or \"19\" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive.  Although the standard allows both the YYYY-MM-DD and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]] YYMMDD (still often used).\n\n===Week dates===\n{{Main article|ISO week date}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-Www ||''or''|| YYYYWww\n|-\n| YYYY-Www-D ||''or''|| YYYYWwwD\n|}\nWeek date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box.  [YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below).  [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.\n\nThere are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:\n*the week with the year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),\n*the week with 4 January in it,\n*the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and\n*the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December \u2013 4 January.\n\nAs a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.\n\nThe week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.\n\nThe ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.\n\nExamples:\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2008-12-29}}\"\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2010-01-03}}\"\n\n===Ordinal dates===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD\n|}\n\nAn [[ordinal date]] is a simple form for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars.  As represented above, [YYYY] indicates a year. [DDD] is the day of that year, from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}} is also {{nowrap|\"1981-095\"}}.\n\nThis format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance.  This system is sometimes referred to as \"Julian Date\", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|-4713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year [0000]).\n\n==Times==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|hh:mm:ss.sss\n|''or''\n|hhmmss.sss\n|-\n| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss\n|-\n| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm\n|-\n| || hh ||\n|}\n\nISO 8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.  The ''basic format'' is [hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is [hh]:[mm]:[ss].\n*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to denote midnight at the end of a calendar day).<!--see below-->\n*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.\n*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).\nSo a time might appear as either \"134730\" in the ''basic format'' or \"13:47:30\" in the ''extended format''.\n\nEither the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased accuracy: [hh]:[mm], [hh][mm] and [hh] are the resulting reduced accuracy time formats.<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 Representations with reduced accuracy</ref>\n\n''[[Midnight]]'' is a special case and may be referred to as either \"00:00\" or \"24:00\". The notation \"00:00\" is used at the beginning of a calendar day and is the more frequently used. At the end of a day use \"24:00\". \"2007-04-05T24:00\" is the same instant as \"2007-04-06T00:00\" (see ''[[#Combined date and time representations|Combined date and time representations]]'' below).\n\nDecimal fractions may be added to any of the three time elements. However, a fraction may only be added to the lowest order time element in the representation. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]] (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2006/11/decimals-score-point-international-standards\n |title=NIST TechBeat 2006-11-22\n |accessdate=2017-09-27\n |date=2006-11-22\n |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\n |quote=Decimals Score a Point on International Standards ...

Represent it as \"14:30,5\", \"1430,5\", \"14:30.5\", or \"1430.5\". There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the [[Significant figures|precision]] of a decimal fraction is 3, i.e., \"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190977(v=sql.90).aspx|title=ISO 8601 Format|website=technet.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Time zone designators===\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;Z\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh:mm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hhmm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh\n|}\n\n[[Time zone]]s in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.\n\nIf no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.\n\n====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====\nIf the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. \"09:30 UTC\" is therefore represented as \"09:30Z\" or \"0930Z\". \"14:45:15 UTC\" would be \"14:45:15Z\" or \"144515Z\".\n\nThe ''Z'' suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as \"Zulu time\" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]]. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the \"Zulu time\" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]<ref name=\"ACP_121_I\">{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL ACP 121(I) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2010 |website= |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |quote=}}</ref> which was formerly used as the international civil time standard.

KGaA]] |location=Weinheim |year=2009 |page=10}}</ref>\n\n====Time offsets from UTC====\nThe [[UTC offset|offset from UTC]] is appended to the time in the same way that 'Z' was above, in the form \u00b1[hh]:[mm], \u00b1[hh][mm], or \u00b1[hh].  So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in [[Berlin]] during the winter), the zone designator would be \"+01:00\", \"+0100\", or simply \"+01\". To represent a time behind UTC the offset is negative. For example, the time in [[New York City|New York]] during standard (not daylight saving) hours is [[UTC\u221205:00]] and the zone designator would then be \"&minus;05:00\", \"&minus;0500\", or simply \"&minus;05\". For other time offsets see [[List of UTC time offsets]]. To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphen&ndash;minus or a [[minus sign]] character. If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&ndash;minus should be used.  [[ASCII]] does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&ndash;minus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. [[Unicode]] has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the [[HTML entity|HTML character entity]] invocation is <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n\nThe following times all refer to the same moment: \"18:30Z\", \"22:30+04\", \"1130&minus;0700\", and \"15:00&minus;03:30\". [[Nautical time]] zone letters are not used with the exception of Z. To calculate UTC time one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for \"15:00&minus;03:30\" do 15:00 &minus; (&minus;03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.\n\nAn offset of zero, in addition to having the special representation \"Z\", can also be stated numerically as \"+00:00\", \"+0000\", or \"+00\".  However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as \"&minus;00:00\", \"&minus;0000\", or \"&minus;00\".  The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value.  Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of \"-00\", with the same denotation as \"+00\" but a differing connotation.<ref>RFC 3339{{spaced ndash}}Unknown local offset convention</ref>\n\nISO 8601 permits the hyphen (-) to be used as the minus (&minus;) character when the character set is limited.<ref>ISO 8601 &sect;3.4.1 stating, \"In an environment where use is made of a character repertoire based on ISO/IEC 646, 'hyphen' and 'minus' are both mapped onto 'hyphen-minus'. Representations with a 'plus-minus' shall only be used in such environment if the interchange repertoire includes 'plus-minus'.\"</ref> In contrast, RFC 3339 explicitly requires the hyphen (-) symbol to represent negative offsets and does not allow for use of the minus (&minus;) symbol.<ref>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6 time-numoffset defined with hyphen symbol</ref>\n\n==Combined date and time representations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\n\nA single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter ''T'' as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30\"}}.\n\nIf a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example,  \"2007-04-05T14:30Z\" or \"2007-04-05T12:30-02:00\".\n\nEither basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced accuracy format.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/>  It is permitted to omit the 'T' character by mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite document\n|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=4.3.2 NOTE: By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.}}</ref>\n\n==Durations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS\n|-\n| PnW\n|-\n| P&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\nDurations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown to the right.  In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].  Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties.  The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.\n\n*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.\n*''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.\n*''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.\n*''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n*''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.\n*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.\n\nFor example, \"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\" represents a duration of \"three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds\".\n\nDate and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, \"P23DT23H\" and \"P4Y\" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus \"P\" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. \"PT0S\" or \"P0D\", however, are both valid and represent the same duration. \n\nTo resolve ambiguity, \"P1M\" is a one-month duration and \"PT1M\" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in \"P0.5Y\" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in \"P0,5Y\" or \"P0.5Y\".  The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their \"carry over points\" except as noted below.  Thus, \"PT36H\" could be used as well as \"P1DT12H\" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that \"PT36H\" is not the same as \"P1DT12H\" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].\n\nAlternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}.  For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|\"P0003-06-04T12:30:05\"}}.  However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format</ref>\n\nAlthough the standard describes durations as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section, the duration format is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class<ref>{{cite web|title=Java 8 Class Duration|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-|website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Alexa Duration|url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration|website=Amazon Developer|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref>.\n\n==Time intervals==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| <start>/<end>\n|-\n| <start>/<duration>\n|-\n| <duration>/<end>\n|-\n| <duration>\n|}\nA time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section).  The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.\n\nThere are four ways to express a time interval:\n\n#Start and end, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Start and duration, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"\n#Duration and end, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Duration only, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\", with additional context information\n\nOf these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] \"/\"). Section 4.4.2 of the standard notes that: \"In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator instead of a solidus.\" The standard does not define the term \"double hyphen\", but previous versions used notations like \"2000--2002\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}</ref> Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01| publisher=Hydrogold |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> A solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and not allowed in a filename in common operating systems.\n\nFor <start>/<end> expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals.  For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as \"2007-12-14T13:30/15:30\", where \"/15:30\" implies \"/2007-12-14T15:30\" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as \"2008-02-15/03-14\", where \"/03-14\" implies \"/2008-03-14\" (the same year as the start).\n\nIf greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13/15\"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00\"}} includes the start and end times.\nTo explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T00:00/15T24:00\"}}.\n\n===Repeating intervals===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| Rnn/<interval>\n|-\n| R/<interval>\n|}\nRepeating intervals are specified in clause \"4.5 Recurring time interval\". They are formed by adding \"R[n]/\" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions. If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\" five times starting at {{nowrap|\"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z\"}}, use {{nowrap|\"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"}}.\n\n==Truncated representations==\nISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used and the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.\n\n==Usage==\nOn the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters]<!--should be XML Schema--></ref>\n\nRFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]] and [[Internet standard|standards]]. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the [[common era]]. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.<ref>RFC 3339, section 5.6</ref>\n\nRFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as \"-00:00\", which ISO 8601 forbids.  RFC 3339 intends \"-00:00\" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming \"+00:00\" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred.  This convention regarding \"-00:00\" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as [[RFC 2822]] which uses it for timestamps in [[email]] headers.  RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.\n\nISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=\u00a74|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref>\nThe [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.\n\nThe [[ISO 8601 week date]], as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall.\n\n== Related standards ==\n<!-- If possible, please specify revisions and release dates as well.

Council members are chosen according to a formula designed to ensure equitable representation of countries from various groups, including those engaged in seabed mineral exploration and the land-based producers of minerals found on the seabed. The Authority holds one annual session, usually of two weeks' duration.\n\nAlso established is a 30-member Legal and Technical Commission which advises the Council and a 15-member Finance Committee that deals with budgetary and related matters.  All members are experts nominated by governments and elected to serve in their individual capacity.\n\nThe Authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore, and eventually exploit, specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources essential for building most technological products.  The Convention also established a body called the Enterprise which is to serve as the Authority\u2019s own mining operator, but no concrete steps have been taken to bring this into being.\n\n==Status==\nThe Authority currently has a Secretariat of 37 authorized posts and a biennial budget of $9.1 million for 2017 and $8.9 million for 2018.. In July 2016, the Assembly of the Authority elected [https://www.weforum.org/people/michael-lodge Michael Lodge] of the United Kingdom, for a four-year term as Secretary-General beginning 1 January 2017.<ref>[https://www.isa.org.jm/sites/default/files/files/documents/isba-22a-10_1.pdf</ref> Decision of the Assembly of the International Seabed Authority concerning the appointment of the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority.] <ref>ISA Press Release SB/14/16, 5 June 200</ref> He succeeds [[Nii Allotey Odunton]] of Ghana, who had served two consecutive four-year terms since 2008.\n\n[[File:InternationalSeabedAuthority-members.png|thumb|250px|Member states represented in blue; observer states in yellow (note: the [[European Union]] also holds membership)]]\n\n==Exploration Contracts==\nThe exploitation system envisaged in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, overseen by the Authority, came to life with the signature in 2001/02 of 15-year contracts with seven organizations that had applied for specific seabed areas in which they were authorized to explore for polymetallic nodules. In 2006, a German entity was added to the list.\n\nThese contractors are: Yuzhmorgeologya (Russian Federation); Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) (Bulgaria, Cuba, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Russian Federation); the Government of the Republic of Korea; China Ocean Minerals Research and Development Association (COMRA) (China); Deep Ocean Resources Development Company (DORD) (Japan); Institut fran\u00e7ais de recherche pour l\u2019exploitation de la mer (IFREMER) (France); the Government of India, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany.\n\nAll but one of the current areas of exploration are in the [[Clarion-Clipperton Zone]], in the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean south and southeast of Hawaii. The remaining area, being explored by India, is in the Central Indian Basin of the Indian Ocean.<ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration Exploration Areas | International Seabed Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915123021/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration |date=15 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nEach area is limited to {{convert|150,000|km2}}, of which half is to be relinquished to the Authority after eight years. Each contractor is required to report once a year on its activities in its assigned area. So far, none of them has indicated any serious move to begin commercial exploitation.\n\nIn 2008, the Authority received two new applications for authorization to explore for polymetallic nodules, coming for the first time from private firms in developing island nations of the Pacific.

They occur as potato-sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor, mainly in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] but with some deposits in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe Council of the Authority began work, in August 2002, on another set of regulations, covering [[polymetallic]] [[sulfide]]s and cobalt-rich [[ferromanganese]] crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, [[zinc]], silver and gold, as well as [[cobalt]]. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world.  The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees to be paid to the Authority and the question of how to deal with any overlapping claims that might arise.<ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/En/SG-Stats/StatesParties18.pdf Statement by the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority to the Eighteenth Meeting of States Parties to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201113034/http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/En/SG-Stats/StatesParties18.pdf |date=1 December 2008 }} New York, 16 June 2008.</ref> Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on ferromanganese crusts.<ref name=\"isa.org.jm\">[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/Cncl/ISBA-14C-11.pdf Statement of the President of the Council of the International Seabed Authority on the work of the Council during the fourteenth session.] Document ISBA/14/C/11, 5 June 2008.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its legislative work, the Authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration, with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences.  It disseminates the results of these meetings through publications. Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining <ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/Pubs/TechStudy3.pdf Biodiversity, species ranges, and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province: predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining.] ISA Technical Study No. 3, 2007.</ref> A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007 <ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-2.pdf Workshop on Designing Marine Protected Areas for Seamounts and the Abyssal Nodule Province in Pacific High Seas.] Document ISBA/14/LTC/2.</ref> produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of \"preservation reference areas\" in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact. The most recent workshop, held at Chennai, India, in February 2008, concerned polymetallic nodule mining technology, with special reference to its current status and challenges ahead <ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-3.pdf Report on the International Seabed Authority's workshop on polymetallic nodule mining technology: current status and challenges ahead.] Document ISBA/14/C/7, prepared by the Secretariat.</ref>\n\nContrary to early hopes that seabed mining would generate extensive revenues for both the exploiting countries and the Authority, no technology has yet been developed for gathering deep-sea minerals at costs that can compete with land-based mines.  Until recently, the consensus has been that economic mining of the ocean depths might be decades away.  Moreover, the [[United States]], with some of the most advanced ocean technology in the world, has not yet ratified the Law of the Sea Convention and is thus not a member of the Authority.\n\nIn recent years, however, interest in deep-sea mining, especially with regard to ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides, has picked up among several firms now operating in waters within the national zones of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to grant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits when it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan\u2019s new ocean policy emphasizes the need to develop [[methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] and hydrothermal deposits within Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone and calls for the commercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on these developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008, Secretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and prices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be derived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for offshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.<ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/Ass/ISBA-14A-2.pdf Report of the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority under article 166, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.] Document ISBA/14/A/2, 14 April 2008.</ref>\n\nIn its preamble, UNCLOS defines the international seabed area\u2014the part under ISA jurisdiction\u2014as \u201cthe seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction\u201d. There are no maps annexed to the Convention to delineate this area. Rather, UNCLOS outlines the areas of national jurisdiction, leaving the rest for the international portion. National jurisdiction over the seabed normally leaves off at {{convert|200|nmi|km}} seaward from baselines running along the shore, unless a nation can demonstrate that its [[continental shelf]] is naturally prolonged beyond that limit, in which case it may claim up to {{convert|350|nmi|km}}. ISA has no role in determining this boundary. Rather, this task is left to another body established by UNCLOS, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which examines scientific data submitted by coastal states that claim a broader reach. [[Maritime boundaries]] between states are generally decided by bilateral negotiation (sometimes with the aid of judicial bodies), not by ISA.\n\nRecently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed resources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States (see [[Territorial claims in the Arctic]]). Mineral exploration and exploitation activities in any seabed area not belonging to these states would fall under ISA jurisdiction.\n\n==Endowment fund==\nIn 2006 the Authority established an Endowment Fund to Support Collaborative Marine Scientific Research on the International Seabed Area. The Fund will aid experienced scientists and technicians from developing countries to participate in deep-sea research organized by international and national institutions. A campaign was launched in February 2008 to identify participants, establish a network of cooperating bodies and seek outside funds to augment the initial $3 million endowment from the Authority.<ref>[http://www.isa.org.jm/en/efund/fund Endowment Fund | International Seabed Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430125957/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/efund/fund |date=30 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe International Seabed Authority Endowment Fund promotes and encourages the conduct of collaborative marine scientific research in the international seabed area through two main activities:\n* ''By supporting the participation of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries in marine scientific research programmes and activities.''\n* ''By providing opportunities to these scientists to participate in relevant initiatives.''\n\nThe Secretariat of the International Seabed Authority is facilitating these activities by creating and maintaining an ongoing list of opportunities for scientific collaboration, including research cruises, deep-sea sample analysis, and training and internship programmes. This entails building a network of co-operating groups interested in (or presently undertaking) these types of activities and programmes, such as universities, institutions, contractors with the Authority and other entities.\n\nThe Secretariat is also actively seeking applications from scientists and other technical personnel from developing nations to be considered for assistance under the Fund. Application guidelines have been prepared for potential recipients to participate in marine scientific research programmes or other scientific co-operation activity, to enroll in training programmes, and to qualify for technical assistance. An advisory panel will evaluate all incoming applications and make recommendations to the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority so successful applicants may be awarded with Fund assistance.\n\nTo maximize opportunities for and participation in the Fund, the Secretariat is also seeking donations and in-kind contributions to build on the initial investment of US$3 million. This entails raising awareness of the Fund, reporting on its successes and encouraging new activities and participants.\n\n==Voluntary Commitments==\nIn 2017, the Authority registered seven voluntary commitments with the UN Oceans Conference for Sustainable Development Goal 14. These were:\n#OceanAction15467 - Enhancing the role of women in marine scientific research through capacity building\n#OceanAction15796 - Encouraging dissemination of research results through the ISA Secretary-General Award for Excellence in Deep-Sea Research\n#OceanAction16538 - Abyssal Initiative for Blue Growth (with UN-DESA)\n#OceanAction16494 - Fostering cooperation to promote the sustainable development of Africa's deep seabed resources in support of Africas Blue Economy\n#OceanAction17746 - Enhancing the assessment of essential ecological functions of the deep sea oceans through long-term underwater oceanographic observatories in the Area; \n#OceanAction17776 - Enhancing deep sea marine biodiversity assessment through the creation of online taxonomic atlases linked to deep sea mining activities in the Area\n\n==Controversy==\nThe exact nature of the ISA's mission and authority has been questioned by opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty who are generally skeptical of multilateral engagement by the United States.<ref>[http://www.unlawoftheseatreaty.org Law of the Sea Treaty.] National Center for Public Policy Research.</ref> The [[United States]] is the only major maritime power that has not ratified the Convention (see [[United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS]]), with one of the main anti-ratification arguments being a charge that the ISA is flawed or unnecessary. In its original form, the Convention included certain provisions that some found objectionable, such as:\n* Imposition of permit requirements, fees and taxation on seabed mining; ban on mining absent ISA permission\n* Use of collected money for [[wealth redistribution]] in addition to ISA administration\n* Mandatory technology transfer\n\nBecause of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the Convention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat mitigates them and thus modifies the ISA's authority. Despite this change the United States has not ratified the Convention and so is not a member of ISA, although it sends sizable delegations to participate in meetings as an observer.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN31335584 U.S. Senate panel backs Law of the Sea treaty | Reuters.] 31 October 2007.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[International waters]]\n* [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]]\n* [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.isa.org.jm International Seabed Authority]\n* [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm Overview - Convention & Related Agreements.] UN: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982).\n\n{{International organizations}}\n{{Coord|17.964767531|-76.791708055|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:International Seabed Authority| ]]\n[[Category:Law of the sea]]\n[[Category:Mining law and governance]]\n[[Category:United Nations General Assembly observers]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Intergovernmental organizations established by treaty]]\n[[Category:International organisations based in Jamaica]]", "sha1": "85ed7y141w7ee60k5u9fnl6jdajp5c5"}}, {"title": "Industry Standard Architecture", "ns": "0", "id": "15029", "revision": {"id": "865301554", "parentid": "862751879", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T01:33:54Z", "contributor": {"ip": "73.202.30.72"}, "comment": "The article is about the bus, not the term.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|other uses of \"ISA\"|Isa (disambiguation)}}\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox Computer Hardware Bus\n| name        = ISA\n| fullname    = Industry Standard Architecture\n| image       = Isa1.jpg\n| caption     = One [[8-bit]] and five [[16-bit]] ISA slots on a [[motherboard]]\n| invent-date = {{Start date and age|1981}}\n| invent-name = [[IBM]]\n| super-name  = [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]],&nbsp;[[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]]\n| super-date  = 1993,&nbsp;1996\n| width       = 8 or 16\n| numdev      = up to 6 devices\n| style       = p\n| hotplug     = no\n| external    = no\n}}\n\n'''Industry Standard Architecture''' ('''ISA''') is the [[16-bit]] internal [[bus (computing)|bus]] of [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC/AT]] and similar computers based on the [[Intel 80286]] and its immediate successors during the 1980s.

The ISA term was coined as a [[retronym]] by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible [[Micro Channel architecture]].\n\nThe 16-bit ISA bus was also used with 32-bit processors for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture]] (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as [[VESA Local Bus]] and [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] were used instead, often along with [[ISA slot]]s on the same [[mainboard]].

In 1988, the 32-bit [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture]] (EISA) standard was proposed by the \"Gang of Nine\" group of PC-compatible manufacturers that included Compaq. In the process, they [[Retronym|retroactively renamed]] the AT bus to \"ISA\" to avoid infringing IBM's trademark on its PC/AT computer.\n\nIBM designed the 8-bit version as a buffered interface to the motherboard buses of the [[Intel 8088]] (16/8 bit) CPU in the IBM PC and PC/XT. The 16-bit version was an upgrade for the motherboard buses of the Intel [[80286]] CPU used in the IBM AT. The ISA bus was therefore synchronous with the CPU clock, until sophisticated buffering methods were implemented by chipsets to interface ISA to much faster CPUs.\n\nISA was designed to connect peripheral cards to the [[motherboard]] and allows for [[bus mastering]]. Only the first 16 [[megabyte|MB]] of main memory is addressable. The original 8-bit bus ran from the 4.77&nbsp;MHz clock of the 8088 CPU in the IBM PC and PC/XT. The original 16-bit bus ran from the CPU clock of the 80286 in IBM PC/AT computers, which was 6&nbsp;MHz in the first models and 8&nbsp;MHz in later models. The [[IBM RT/PC]] also used the 16-bit bus. ISA was also used in some non-IBM compatible machines such as Motorola [[68k]]-based [[Apollo Computer|Apollo]] (68020) and [[Amiga 3000]] (68030) workstations, the short-lived [[AT&T Hobbit]] and the later [[PowerPC]]-based [[BeBox]].\n\nCompanies like [[Dell]] improved the AT bus's performance<ref name=\"lewis19880424\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/business/the-executive-computer-introducing-the-first-ps-2-clones.html | title=Introducing the First PS/2 Clones | work=The New York Times | date=1988-04-24 | accessdate=6 January 2015 | author=Lewis, Peter H. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106224927/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/business/the-executive-computer-introducing-the-first-ps-2-clones.html | archivedate=6 January 2015 | df= }}</ref> but in 1987, IBM replaced the AT bus with its proprietary [[Micro Channel Architecture]] (MCA). MCA overcame many of the limitations then apparent in ISA but was also an effort by IBM to regain control of the PC architecture and the PC market. MCA was far more advanced than ISA and had many features that would later appear in PCI. However, MCA was also a closed standard whereas IBM had released full specifications and circuit schematics for ISA. Computer manufacturers responded to MCA by developing the [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture]] (EISA) and the later [[VESA Local Bus]] (VLB). VLB used some electronic parts originally intended for MCA because component manufacturers already were equipped to manufacture them. Both EISA and VLB were backwards-compatible expansions of the AT (ISA) bus.\n\nUsers of ISA-based machines had to know special information about the hardware they were adding to the system. While a handful of devices were essentially \"[[plug-n-play]]\", this was rare. Users frequently had to configure parameters when adding a new device, such as the [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] line, [[I/O address]], or [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channel. MCA had done away with this complication and [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] actually incorporated many of the ideas first explored with MCA, though it was more directly descended from EISA.\n\nThis trouble with configuration eventually led to the creation of '''ISA PnP''', a [[plug-n-play]] system that used a combination of modifications to hardware, the system [[BIOS]], and [[operating system]] software to automatically manage resource allocations. In reality, ISA PnP could be troublesome and did not become well-supported until the architecture was in its final days.\n\nPCI slots were the first physically-incompatible expansion ports to directly squeeze ISA off the [[motherboard]]. At first, motherboards were largely ISA, including a few PCI slots. By the mid-1990s, the two slot types were roughly balanced, and ISA slots soon were in the minority of consumer systems. [[Microsoft]]'s [[PC 99]] specification recommended that ISA slots be removed entirely, though the system architecture still required ISA to be present in some vestigial way internally to handle the [[floppy drive]], [[serial port]]s, etc., which was why the software compatible [[LPC bus]] was created. ISA slots remained for a few more years, and towards the turn of the century it was common to see systems with an [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] (AGP) sitting near the [[central processing unit]], an array of PCI slots, and one or two ISA slots near the end. In late 2008, even floppy disk drives and serial ports were disappearing, and the extinction of vestigial ISA (by then the [[LPC bus]]) from chipsets was on the horizon.\n\nPCI slots are \"rotated\" compared to their ISA counterparts&mdash;PCI cards were essentially inserted \"upside-down,\" allowing ISA and PCI connectors to squeeze together on the motherboard. Only one of the two connectors can be used in each slot at a time, but this allowed for greater flexibility.\n\nThe [[AT Attachment]] (ATA) hard disk interface is directly descended from the 16-bit ISA of the PC/AT. ATA has its origins in [[hardcards]] that integrated a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) and a [[hard disk controller]] (HDC) onto one card. This was at best awkward and at worst damaging to the motherboard, as ISA slots were not designed to support such heavy devices as HDDs. The next generation of [[Integrated Drive Electronics]] drives moved both the drive and controller to a drive bay and used a ribbon cable and a very simple interface board to connect it to an ISA slot. ATA is basically a standardization of this arrangement plus a uniform command structure for software to interface with the HDC within the drive. ATA has since been separated from the ISA bus and connected directly to the local bus, usually by integration into the chipset, for much higher clock rates and data throughput than ISA could support. ATA has clear characteristics of 16-bit ISA, such as a 16-bit transfer size, signal timing in the PIO modes and the interrupt and DMA mechanisms.\n\n==ISA bus architecture==\n{| class=\"floatright\"  \n| style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0; border-spacing:0; border-collapse: collapse;\" | <br>[[File:XT Bus pins.svg|220px|right]] \n| style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0; border-spacing:0; border-collapse: collapse;\" | [[File:ISA Bus pins.svg|470px|right]]\n|}\n\nThe '''PC/XT-bus''' is an eight-[[bit]] ISA bus used by [[Intel 8086]] and [[Intel 8088]] systems in the [[IBM PC]] and [[IBM PC XT]] in the 1980s. Among its 62 pins were [[demultiplex]]ed and electrically buffered versions of the 8 data and 20 address lines of the 8088 processor, along with power lines, clocks, read/write strobes, interrupt lines, etc. Power lines included \u22125&nbsp;V and \u00b112&nbsp;V in order to directly support [[PMOS logic|pMOS]] and enhancement mode [[NMOS logic|nMOS]] circuits such as dynamic RAMs among other things. The XT bus architecture uses a single [[Intel 8259]] [[Programmable Interrupt Controller|PIC]], giving eight vectorized and prioritized interrupt lines. It has four [[direct memory access|DMA]] channels originally provided by the [[Intel 8237]], 3 of the DMA channels are brought out to the XT bus expansion slots; of these, 2 are normally already allocated to machine functions (diskette drive and hard disk controller):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! DMA channel !! Expansion !! Standard function\n|-\n| 0 || No  || [[Dynamic random-access memory]] refresh\n|-\n| 1 || Yes || Add-on cards\n|-\n| 2 || Yes || [[Floppy disk]] controller\n|-\n| 3 || Yes || [[Hard disk]] controller\n|}\nThe '''PC/AT-bus''', a 16-[[bit]] (or 80286-) version of the PC/XT bus, was introduced with the [[IBM PC/AT]]. This bus was officially termed ''I/O Channel'' by IBM. It extends the XT-bus by adding a second shorter [[edge connector]] in-line with the eight-bit XT-bus connector, which is unchanged, retaining compatibility with most 8-bit cards. The second connector adds four additional address lines for a total of 24, and 8 additional data lines for a total of 16. It also adds new interrupt lines connected to a second [[Intel 8259|8259 PIC]] (connected to one of the lines of the first) and 4 \u00d7 16-bit DMA channels, as well as control lines to select 8- or 16-bit transfers.\n\nThe 16-bit AT bus slot originally used two standard edge connector sockets in early IBM PC/AT machines. However, with the popularity of the AT-architecture and the 16-bit ISA bus, manufacturers introduced specialized 98-pin connectors that integrated the two sockets into one unit. These can be found in almost every AT-class PC manufactured after the mid-1980s. The ISA slot connector is typically black (distinguishing it from the brown EISA connectors and white PCI connectors).\n\n===Number of devices===\nMotherboard devices have dedicated IRQs (not present in the slots).  16-bit devices can use either PC-bus or PC/AT-bus IRQs. It is therefore possible to connect up to 6 devices that use one 8-bit IRQ each, or up to 5 devices that use one 16-bit IRQ each. At the same time, up to 4 devices may use one 8-bit DMA channel each, while up to 3 devices can use one 16-bit DMA channel each.\n\n===Varying bus speeds===\nOriginally, the bus clock was synchronous with the CPU clock, resulting in varying bus clock frequencies among the many different IBM \"clones\" on the market (sometimes as high as 16 or 20&nbsp;MHz), leading to software or electrical timing problems for certain ISA cards at bus speeds they were not designed for. Later motherboards or integrated [[chipset]]s used a separate clock generator, or a clock divider which either fixed the ISA bus frequency at 4, 6, or 8&nbsp;MHz or allowed the user to adjust the frequency via the [[BIOS]] setup. When used at a higher bus frequency, some ISA cards (certain [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules-compatible]] video cards, for instance), could show significant performance improvements.\n\n===8/16-bit incompatibilities===\nMemory address decoding for the selection of 8 or 16-bit transfer mode was limited to 128&nbsp;KiB sections, leading to problems when mixing 8- and 16-bit cards as they could not co-exist in the same 128&nbsp;KiB area. This is because the MEMCS16 line is required to be set based on the value of LA17-23 only.\n\n==Past and current use==\nISA is still used today for specialized industrial purposes.  In 2008 IEI Technologies released a modern motherboard for Intel Core 2 Duo processors which, in addition to other special I/O features, is equipped with two ISA slots. It is marketed to industrial and military users who have invested in expensive specialized ISA bus adaptors, which are not available in [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] bus versions.<ref>IEI Technology Corp: ''IMBA-9654ISA User Manual'', Rev. 1.00, May 2008</ref>\n\nSimilarly, ADEK Industrial Computers is releasing a motherboard in early 2013 for Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processors, which contains one (non-DMA) ISA slot.<ref>ADEK Industrial Computers:  ''MS-98A9 Product Specifications''</ref>\n\nThe [[PC/104]] bus, used in industrial and embedded applications, is a derivative of the ISA bus, utilizing the same signal lines with different connectors. The [[Low Pin Count|LPC]] bus has replaced the ISA bus as the connection to the legacy I/O devices on recent motherboards; while physically quite different, LPC looks just like ISA to software, so that the peculiarities of ISA such as the 16 MiB DMA limit (which corresponds to the full address space of the Intel 80286 CPU used in the original IBM AT) are likely to stick around for a while.\n\n=== ATA ===\nAs explained in the ''History'' section, ISA was the basis for development of the [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] interface, used for ATA (a.k.a. IDE) and more recently [[Serial ATA|Serial ATA (SATA)]] hard disks. Physically, ATA is essentially a simple subset of ISA, with 16 data bits, support for exactly one IRQ and one DMA channel, and 3 address bits. To this ISA subset, ATA adds two IDE address select (\"chip select\") lines and a few unique signal lines specific to ATA/IDE hard disks (such as the Cable Select/Spindle Sync. line.) In addition to the physical interface channel, ATA goes beyond and far outside the scope of ISA by also specifying a set of physical device registers to be implemented on every ATA (IDE) drive and a full set of protocols and device commands for controlling fixed disk drives using these registers. The ATA device registers are accessed using the address bits and address select signals in the ATA physical interface channel, and all operations of ATA hard disks are performed using the ATA-specified protocols through the ATA command set. The earliest versions of the ATA standard featured a few simple protocols and a basic command set comparable to the command sets of MFM and RLL controllers (which preceded ATA controllers), but the latest ATA standards have much more complex protocols and instruction sets that include optional commands and protocols providing such advanced optional-use features as sizable hidden system storage areas, password security locking, and programmable geometry translation.\n\nA further deviation between ISA and ATA is that while the ISA bus remained locked into a single standard clock rate (for backward hardware compatibility), the ATA interface offered many different speed modes, could select among them to match the maximum speed supported by the attached drives, and kept adding faster speeds with later versions of the ATA standard (up to 133 MB/s for ATA-6, the latest.) In most forms, ATA ran much faster than ISA, provided it was connected directly to a local bus faster than the ISA bus.\n\n=== XT-IDE ===\nBefore the 16-bit [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA/IDE]] interface, there was an 8-bit XT-IDE (also known as XTA) interface for hard disks. It was not nearly as popular as ATA has become, and XT-IDE hardware is now fairly hard to find. Some XT-IDE adapters were available as 8-bit ISA cards, and XTA sockets were also present on the motherboards of [[Amstrad]]'s later XT clones as well as a short-lived line of [[Philips]] units. The XTA pinout was very similar to ATA, but only eight data lines and two address lines were used, and the physical device registers had completely different meanings.  A few hard drives (such as the [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] ST351A/X) could support either type of interface, selected with a jumper.\n\nMany later AT (and AT successor) motherboards had no integrated hard drive interface but relied on a separate hard drive interface plugged into an ISA/EISA/VLB slot. There were even a few 80486 based units shipped with MFM/RLL interfaces and drives instead of the increasingly common AT-IDE.\n\n[[Commodore International|Commodore]] built the XT-IDE based peripheral hard drive / memory expansion unit A590 for their [[Amiga 500]] and 500+ computers that also supported a [[SCSI]] drive. AT-IDE type interfaces only entered the keyboard-cased Amiga line upon introduction of the [[Amiga 600|A600]] and [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] which have an [[Amiga custom chips#Gayle|integrated interface]] and 44 pin connector. Many owners removed the 2,5 inch bracket and installed a 3,5 inch drive with an adapter cable.\n\n=== PCMCIA ===\nThe [[PCMCIA]] specification can be seen as a superset of ATA.  The standard for PCMCIA hard disk interfaces, which included PCMCIA flash drives, allows for the mutual configuration of the port and the drive in an ATA mode.  As a de facto extension, most PCMCIA flash drives additionally allow for a simple ATA mode that is enabled by pulling a single pin low, so that PCMCIA hardware and firmware are unnecessary to use them as an ATA drive connected to an ATA port.  PCMCIA flash drive to ATA adapters are thus simple and inexpensive, but are not guaranteed to work with any and every standard PCMCIA flash drive.  Further, such adapters cannot be used as generic PCMCIA ports, as the PCMCIA interface is much more complex than ATA.\n\n==Emulation by embedded chips==\nAlthough most modern computers do not have physical ISA buses, all IBM compatible computers \u2014 [[x86]], and [[x86-64]] (most non-mainframe, non-embedded) \u2014 have ISA buses allocated in [[physical address space]]. Embedded controller chips ([[Southbridge (computing)|southbridge]]) and [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] themselves provide services such as temperature monitoring and voltage readings through these buses as ISA devices.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Standardization==\nIEEE started a standardization of the ISA bus in 1985, called the P996 specification. However, despite there even having been books published on the P996 specification, it never officially progressed past draft status.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=GZFv0Vv8CEcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA191\n|title=A+ Guide to PC Hardware Maintenance and Repair, Volume 1\n|first=Michael W. \n|last=Graves\n|publisher=Thomson, Delmar Learning\n|year=2005\n|isbn=1401852300\n|page=191\n}}</ref>\n==Modern ISA cards==\nThere still is an existing user base with old computers, so some ISA cards are still manufactured, e.g. with [[USB]] ports<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lo-tech.co.uk/wiki/Lo-tech_ISA_USB_Adapter|title=Lo-tech ISA USB Adapter - lo-tech.co.uk|author=|date=|website=www.lo-tech.co.uk|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409124559/https://www.lo-tech.co.uk/wiki/Lo-tech_ISA_USB_Adapter|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}</ref> or complete [[single board computer]]s based on modern processors, [[USB 3.0]], and [[SATA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advantech.com/products/1-2jkn7b/pca-6763/mod_ed19377c-5db9-4024-bf7b-c556dfb2afac|title=PCA-6763|author=|date=|website=www.advantech.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024101730/http://www.advantech.com/products/1-2jkn7b/pca-6763/mod_ed19377c-5db9-4024-bf7b-c556dfb2afac|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[PC/104]] - Embedded variant of ISA\n* [[Low Pin Count]] (LPC) - Low pin count version of ISA\n* [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture]] (EISA)\n* [[Micro Channel architecture]] (MCA)\n* [[VESA Local Bus]] (VLB)\n* [[Accelerated Graphics Port]] (AGP)\n* [[PCI-X]]\n* [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI)\n* [[PCI Express]] (PCI-E or PCIe)\n* [[List of computer bus interfaces]]\n* [[Amiga Zorro II]]\n* [[NuBus]]\n* [[Switched fabric]]\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[CompactPCI]]\n* [[PC card]]\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]]\n* [[Legacy port]]\n* [[Backplane]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_intelbusSpep89_3342148/ Intel ISA Bus Specification and Application Notes - Rev 2.01]'';

This small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of [[climate science]], The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[United States State Department|State Department]] wanted an international convention to agree restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]]es, and the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] was concerned about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from United Nations bodies including UNEP and the WMO. The U.S. government was the main force in forming the IPCC as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts on the science and as official representatives of their governments, to produce reports which had the firm backing of all the leading scientists worldwide researching the topic, and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every one of the participating governments. In this way, it was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation.<ref name=\"Weart international 80s\" /> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces and assesses evidence on climate change. They produce many assessments and in each of the assessment reports, it is uncovered which they have found to be the most dominant in contributing to climate change since the last report was conducted.\n\nThe IPCC has adopted and published \"Principles Governing IPCC Work\",<ref name=\"principles\"/> which states that the IPCC will assess:\n* the risk of [[Global warming|human-induced climate change]], \n* its [[Effects of global warming|potential impacts]], and \n* possible [[Climate change mitigation|options for prevention]].  \nThis document also states that IPCC will do this work by assessing \"on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific,  technical  and  socio-economic  information  relevant  to  understanding  the  scientific  basis\" of these topics.   The Principles also state that \"IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy, although they may need to deal objectively with scientific, technical and socio-economic factors relevant to the application of particular policies.\"  <ref name=\"principles\"/>\n\n== Organization ==\nKorean economist [[Hoesung Lee]] has been the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau.<ref>https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/ipcc42/151006_election_of_new_chair.pdf</ref> \nBefore this election, the IPCC was led by his Vice-Chair [[Ismail El Gizouli]], who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC press release: IPCC agrees on Acting Chair after R.K.

They calculate with confidence that CO<sub>2</sub> has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect. They predict that under a \"business as usual\" (BAU) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C per decade during the [21st] century. They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6&nbsp;\u00b0C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability. The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more.\n\n===Supplementary report of 1992===\nThe 1992 supplementary report was an update, requested in the context of the negotiations on the UNFCCC at the [[Earth Summit]] (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992.\n\nThe major conclusion was that research since 1990 did \"not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first IPCC scientific assessment\". It noted that transient (time-dependent) simulations, which had been very preliminary in the FAR, were now improved, but did not include aerosol or ozone changes.\n\n===Second assessment report===\n{{Main article|IPCC Second Assessment Report}}\n''Climate Change 1995'', the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR), was finished in 1996. It is split into four parts:\n* A synthesis to help interpret UNFCCC article 2.\n* ''The Science of Climate Change'' (WG I)\n* ''Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change'' (WG II)\n* ''Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change'' (WG III)\n\nEach of the last three parts was completed by a separate working group, and each has a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) that represents a consensus of national representatives. The SPM of the WG I report contains headings:\n\n# Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase\n# Anthropogenic [[aerosol]]s tend to produce negative radiative forcings\n# Climate has changed over the past century (air temperature has increased by between 0.3 and 0.6&nbsp;\u00b0C since the late 19th century; this estimate has not significantly changed since the 1990 report).\n# The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate (considerable progress since the 1990 report in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate, because of: including aerosols; coupled models; pattern-based studies)\n# Climate is expected to continue to change in the future (increasing realism of simulations increases confidence; important uncertainties remain but are taken into account in the range of model projections)\n# There are still many uncertainties (estimates of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling; models; instrument data for model testing, assessment of variability, and detection studies)\n\n===Third assessment report===\n{{Main article|IPCC Third Assessment Report}}\n\nThe Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports, three of them from its working groups:\n* Working Group I: The Scientific Basis<ref name = \"IPCC WG1\">[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/index.htm Working Group 1], IPCC.</ref>\n* Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability<ref name=\"IPCC WG2\">[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/index.htm Working Group 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303133040/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/index.htm |date=3 March 2007 }}, IPCC.</ref>\n* Working Group III: Mitigation<ref name=\"IPCC WG3\">[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/index.htm Working Group 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050708040418/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/index.htm |date=8 July 2005 }}, IPCC.</ref>\n* Synthesis Report<ref name=\"IPCC Synth\">[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/index.htm Synthesis Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617035936/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/index.htm |date=17 June 2005 }}, IPCC.</ref>\n\nA number of the TAR's conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct, e.g., greater than 66% probability of being correct.<ref name=\"tar uncertainties\">\n{{citation\n |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/019.htm\n |chapter     = Question 2\n |title       = Box 2-1: Confidence and likelihood statements\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604185105/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/vol4/english/019.htm\n |archivedate = 4 June 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR SYR|2001|p=44}}\n</ref> These are \"[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]]\" probabilities, which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.<ref>\n{{citation\n |author          = Ahmad, Q.K.\n |chapter         = Ch 2: Methods and Tools\n |chapter-url     = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/068.htm\n |url             = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/106.htm\n |title           = Sec. 2.6.2. \"Objective\" and \"Subjective\" Probabilities are not Always Explicitly Distinguished\n |display-authors = etal\n |deadurl         = yes\n |archiveurl      = https://web.archive.org/web/20130504044157/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/106.htm\n |archivedate     = 4 May 2013\n |df              = dmy-all\n}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR WG2|2001}}.\n</ref><ref>\n{{citation\n |year            = 2009\n |author          = Granger Morgan, M.\n |title           = Synthesis and Assessment Product 5.2: Best practice approaches for characterizing, communicating, and incorporating scientific uncertainty in decisionmaking.

The Summary for Policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change.

In order to achieve the 1.5 \u00b0C target, CO2 emissions must decline by 45% (relative to 2010 levels) by 2030, reaching net zero by around 2050. Deep reductions in non-CO2 emissions (such as nitrous oxide and methane) will also be required to limit warming to 1.5 \u00b0C. Under the pledges of the countries entering the Paris Accord, a sharp rise of 3.1 to 3.7 \u00b0C is still expected to occur by 2100. Holding this rise to 1.5 \u00b0C avoids the worst effects of a rise by even 2 \u00b0C. However, a warming of even 1.5 degrees will still result in large-scale drought, famine, heat stress, species die-off, loss of entire ecosystems, and loss of habitable land, throwing more that 100 Million into poverty. Effects will be most drastic in arid regions including the [[Middle East]] and the [[Sahel]] in Africa, where fresh water will remain in some areas following a 1.5 \u00b0C rise in temperatures but are expected to dry up completely if the rise reaches 2 \u00b0C.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Irfan |first1=Umair |title=A major climate report will slam the door on wishful thinking |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/5/17934174/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-1-5-degrees |accessdate=7 Oct 2018 |agency=Vox |date=6 Oct 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/ |website=Intergovermental Panel on Climate change |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Davenport |first1=Coral |title=Major Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html |accessdate=8 Oct 2018 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=7 Oct 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nThe IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process.<ref name=\"principles\" /> While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-data.org/ |title=Welcome to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre |publisher=Ipcc-data.org |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/ |title=IPCC \u2013 National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> required under the UNFCCC.

Its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km<sup>2</sup> by the year 2035 (WWF, 2005).''\n\nThis projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers. The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. They expressed regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\".

The first models were shipped in January 1983.\n\n==IBM PC as standard==\n{{main|Influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market}}\nThe success of the IBM computer led other companies to develop ''[[IBM PC compatible|IBM Compatibles]]'', which in turn led to branding like diskettes being advertised as \"IBM format\". An IBM PC clone could be built with off-the-shelf parts, but the [[BIOS]] required some reverse engineering. Companies like [[Compaq]], [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix Software Associates]], [[American Megatrends]], [[Award Software|Award]], and others achieved fully functional versions of the BIOS, allowing companies like Dell, Gateway and HP to manufacture PCs that worked like IBM's product. The IBM PC became the industry standard.\n\n==Third-party distribution==\nBecause IBM had no retail experience, the retail chains ComputerLand and Sears Roebuck provided important knowledge of the marketplace.<ref name=\"mace19811005\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&ots=UIUJBsfNdl&pg=RA1-PA49#v=onepage&f=true | title=Where You Can Go to Purchase the New Computers | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-10-05 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Mace, Scott | page=49}}</ref>{{r|sandler198411}}{{r|elder198907}}{{r|mcmullen19840221}} They became the main outlets for the new product. More than 190 Computerland stores already existed, while Sears was in the process of creating a handful of in-store computer centers for sale of the new product. This guaranteed IBM widespread distribution across the U.S.\n\nTargeting the new PC at the home market, Sears Roebuck sales failed to live up to expectations. This unfavorable outcome revealed that the strategy of targeting the office market was the key to higher sales.\n\n==Models==\n{{Infobox information appliance\n| image        = Ibm pc 5150.jpg\n| caption      = IBM 5150 PC with [[IBM 5151]] monitor\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ The IBM PC line\n|-\n!

Some programs are time sensitive to a particular speed class. Older programs will not take advantage of newer higher-resolution and higher-color display standards, while some newer programs require newer display adapters.<!-- An example is Majhongg by Nels Anderson, which suppoorts no less than EGA graphics -->  (Note that as the display adapter was an adapter card in all of these IBM models, newer display hardware could easily be, and often was, retrofitted to older models.)  A few programs, typically very early ones, are written for and require a specific version of the IBM PC BIOS ROM.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Most notably, [[BASICA]] which was dependent on the BIOS ROM had a sister program called [[GW-BASIC]] which supported more functions, was 100% backwards compatible and could run independently from the BIOS ROM.\n\n===Original PC===\n[[File:IMB PC-IMG 7271.jpg|thumb|IBM PC 5150.]]\nThe [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] video card, with a suitable modulator, could use an NTSC [[television]] set or an RGBi monitor for display; IBM's RGBi monitor was their display model 5153. The other option that was offered by IBM was an [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] and their [[IBM 5151|monochrome display model 5151]]. It was possible to install both an MDA and a CGA card and use both monitors concurrently<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/dualhead.html|title=Dual-Head operation on vintage PCs|publisher=}}</ref> if supported by the application program. For example, [[AutoCAD]], [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and others allowed use of a CGA Monitor for graphics and a separate [[monochrome monitor]] for text menus. Some model 5150 PCs with CGA monitors and a printer port also included the MDA adapter by default, because IBM provided the MDA port and printer port on the same adapter card; it was in fact an MDA/printer port combo card.\n\nAlthough [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] was originally envisioned by IBM as a low-budget storage alternative, the most commonly used medium was the [[floppy disk]]. The 5150 was available with one or two {{frac|5|1|4}}\" floppy drives \u2013 with two drives the program disc(s) would be in drive A, while drive B would hold the disc(s) for working files; with one drive the user had to swap program and file discs into the single drive. For models without any drives or storage medium, IBM intended users to connect their own cassette recorder via the 5150's cassette socket. The cassette tape socket was physically the same [[DIN plug]] as the keyboard socket and next to it, but electrically completely different.\n\nA [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] could not be installed into the 5150's system unit without changing to a higher-rated power supply (although later drives with lower power consumption have been known to work with the standard 63.5 Watt unit). The \"IBM 5161 Expansion Chassis\" came with its own power supply and one 10&nbsp;MB hard disk and allowed the installation of a second hard disk.<ref>Scott Mueller ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Second Edition'', Que Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88022-856-3}} page 48</ref> The system unit had five expansion slots, and the expansion unit had eight; however, one of the system unit's slots and one of the expansion unit's slots had to be occupied by the Extender Card and Receiver Card, respectively, which were needed to connect the expansion unit to the system unit and make the expansion unit's other slots available, for a total of 11 slots. A working configuration required that some of the slots be occupied by display, disk, and I/O adapters, as none of these were built into the 5150's motherboard; the only motherboard external connectors were the keyboard and cassette ports.\n\nThe simple [[PC speaker]] sound hardware was also on board.\n\nThe original PC's maximum memory using IBM parts was 256&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]], achievable through the installation of 64&nbsp;kB on the motherboard and three 64 kB expansion cards. The processor was an [[Intel 8088]] running at 4.77&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency of 315/88&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.579{{Overline|54}}{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}}&nbsp;MHz. (In early units, the Intel 8088 used was a 1978 version, later were 1978/81/2 versions of the Intel chip; second-sourced [[AMD]]s were used after 1983){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some owners replaced the 8088 with an [[NEC V20]] for a slight increase in processing speed and support for real mode 80186 instructions. The V20 gained its speed increase through the use of a hardware multiplier which the 8088 lacked. An [[Intel 8087]] [[coprocessor]] could also be added for hardware floating-point arithmetic.\n\nIBM sold the first IBM PCs in configurations with 16 or 64&nbsp;kB of [[random-access memory|RAM]] preinstalled using either nine or thirty-six 16-[[kilobit]] [[DRAM]] chips. (The ninth bit was used for [[parity bit|parity]] checking of memory.) In November 1982, the ROM for the IBM PC was changed to allow the use of 64 Kbit chips (as opposed to the original 16 Kbit chips) -- the same RAM configuration as the soon-to-be-released IBM XT. (64 kB in one bank, expandable to 256kB by populating the other 3 banks.)\n\nAlthough the TV-compatible video board, cassette port and [[Federal Communications Commission]] Class B certification were all aimed at making it a [[home computer]],{{r|bradley199009}} the original PC proved too expensive for the home market. At introduction, a PC with 64 kB of RAM and a single 5.25-inch floppy drive and monitor sold for {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US $]]3,005}} ({{Inflation|US|3005|1981|fmt=eq}}), while the cheapest configuration ({{nowrap|US $1,565}}) that had no floppy drives, only 16&nbsp;kB RAM, and no monitor (again, under the expectation that users would connect their existing TV sets and cassette recorders) proved too unattractive and low-spec, even for its time (cf. footnotes to the above IBM PC range table).<ref>[http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html Whence Came the IBM PC Test and Measurement World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217120019/http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA187350.html |date=2007-12-17 }}, retrieved March 2,</ref><ref>Gene Smart and Andrew Reinhardt, ''15 years of Bits, Bytes and Other Great Moments'', ''[[BYTE Magazine]]'', September 1990 pg. 382</ref> While the 5150 did not become a top selling home computer, its floppy-based configuration became an unexpectedly large success with businesses.\n\n===XT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer XT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT\", IBM model 5160, was introduced two years after the PC and featured a 10 megabyte hard drive. It had eight expansion slots but the same processor and clock speed as the PC. The XT had no cassette jack, but still had the Cassette Basic interpreter in ROMs.\n\nThe XT could take 256&nbsp;kB of memory on the main board (using 64&nbsp;kbit DRAM); later models were expandable to 640&nbsp;kB. The remaining 384 kilobytes of the 8088 address space (between 640 KB and 1 MB) were used for the BIOS ROM, adapter ROM and RAM space, including video RAM space. It was usually sold with a [[Monochrome Display Adapter]] (MDA) video card or a CGA video card.\n\nThe eight expansion slots were the same as the model 5150 but were spaced closer together. Although rare, a card designed for the 5150 could be wide enough to obstruct the adjacent slot in an XT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627010207/http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/xt/newxt/xt_mainboard2.JPG|archivedate=2008-06-27|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howard81.co.uk/upload/vcf/5150/5150_mainboard(highres).JPG|title=Howard81.co.uk|publisher=}}</ref>  Because of the spacing, an XT motherboard would not fit into a case designed for the PC motherboard, but the slots and peripheral cards were compatible. The XT expansion bus (later called \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture]]\" (ISA) by competitors) was retained in the IBM AT, which added connectors for some slots to allow 16-bit transfers; 8-bit cards could be used in an AT.\n\n===XT/370===\n{{main|PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes}}\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer XT/370\" was an XT with three custom 8-bit cards: the processor card (370PC-P) contained a modified [[Motorola 68000]] chip, microcoded to execute [[System/370]] instructions, a second 68000 to handle bus arbitration and memory transfers, and a modified 8087 to emulate the S/370 [[floating point]] instructions. The second card (370PC-M) connected to the first and contained 512 kB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator necessary to install the system software for the VM/PC software to run the processors.\n\nThe computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program.<ref>[http://www.corestore.org/XT370-1.jpg Corestore.org]</ref><ref>Muller, Guide to repairing and upgrading PCs 6th edition</ref>\n\n===PCjr===\n{{Main|IBM PCjr}}\nThe \"IBM PCjr\" was IBM's first attempt to enter the market for relatively inexpensive educational and home-use personal computers. The PCjr, IBM model number 4860, retained the IBM PC's 8088 CPU and BIOS interface for compatibility, but its cost and differences in the PCjr's architecture, as well as other design and implementation decisions (chief among these was the use of a \"chiclet\" keyboard, which was difficult to type with), eventually led to the PCjr, and the related [[IBM JX]], being commercial failures.\n\n===Portable===\n{{Main|IBM Portable Personal Computer}}\nThe \"IBM Portable Personal Computer\" 5155 model 68 was an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It was released in February 1984, and was eventually replaced by the IBM Convertible.\n\nThe Portable was an XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512&nbsp;KB), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome (amber) composite monitor, and one or two half-height 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA board and a composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television.\n\n===AT===\n{{Main|IBM Personal Computer/AT}}\n\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer/AT\" (model 5170), announced August 15, 1984, used an [[Intel 80286]] processor, originally running at 6&nbsp;MHz. It had a 16-[[bit]] ISA bus and 20&nbsp;MB [[hard drive]]. A faster model, running at 8&nbsp;MHz and sporting a 30-megabyte hard disk<ref>i.e. 33% more speed, 50% more disk space</ref> was introduced in 1986.<ref>PC Magazine, Sept. 30, 1986, pp. 179-184</ref>\n\nThe AT was designed to support multitasking; the new SysRq ([[system request]]) key, little noted and often overlooked, is part of this design, as is the 80286 itself, the first Intel 16-bit processor with multitasking features (i.e. the 80286 protected mode). IBM made some attempt at marketing the AT as a multi-user machine, but it sold mainly as a faster PC for power users. For the most part, IBM PC/ATs were used as more powerful DOS (single-tasking) personal computers, in the literal sense of the PC name.\n\nEarly PC/ATs were plagued with reliability problems, in part because of some software and hardware incompatibilities, but mostly related to the internal 20&nbsp;MB hard disk, and High Density Floppy Disk Drive.<ref>The opening sentence of an April 29, 1986 PC Magazine article reads \"If you own an IBM PC AT and your hard disk hasn't crashed yet, don't worry &ndash; it probably will.\" [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html highbeam.com] & [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-3760999.html encyclopedia.com] (the latter a Chicago Sun-Times article citing the PC Magazine story). IBM recovered, although with mixed comments, as noted in the Sept. 30, 1986 PC Magazine article, \"The Two Faces of IBM's 8-MHz AT,\" pp. 179 - 184.</ref>\n\nWhile some people blamed IBM's [[hard disk controller]] card and others blamed the hard disk manufacturer [[Computer Memories Inc.]] (CMI), the IBM controller card worked fine with other drives, including CMI's 33-MB model. The problems introduced doubt about the computer and, for a while, even about the 286 architecture in general, but after IBM replaced the 20&nbsp;MB CMI drives, the PC/AT proved reliable and became a lasting industry standard.\n\nIBM AT's Drive parameter table listed the CMI-33 as having 615 cylinders instead of the 640 the drive was designed with, as to make the size an even 30 MB. Those who re-used the drives mostly found that the 616th cylinder was bad due to it being used as a landing area.\n\n===AT/370===\nThe \"IBM Personal Computer AT/370\" was an AT with two custom 16-bit cards, running almost exactly the same setup as the XT/370.\n\n===Convertible===\n{{Main|IBM PC Convertible}}\nThe IBM PC Convertible, released April 3, 1986, was IBM's first laptop computer and was also the first IBM computer to utilize the 3.5\" floppy disk which went on to become the standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries. It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140. The concept and the design of the body was made by the German industrial designer [[Richard Sapper]].\n\nIt utilized an Intel 80c88 CPU (a CMOS version of the Intel 8088) running at 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 256 kB of RAM (expandable to 640 kB), dual 720 kB 3.5\" floppy drives, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD screen at a price of $2,000. It weighed {{convert|13|lb|kg}} and featured a built-in carrying handle.\n\nThe PC Convertible had expansion capabilities through a proprietary ISA bus-based port on the rear of the machine. Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, could be snapped into place. The machine could also take an internal modem, but there was no room for an internal hard disk.\n\n===Next-generation IBM PS/2===\nThe [[IBM PS/2]] line was introduced in 1987. The Model 30 at the bottom end of the lineup was very similar to earlier models; it used an 8086 processor and an ISA bus. The Model 30 was not \"IBM compatible\" in that it did not have standard 5.25-inch drive bays; it came with a 3.5-inch floppy drive and optionally a 3.5-inch-sized hard disk. Most models in the PS/2 line further departed from \"IBM compatible\" by replacing the ISA bus completely with [[Micro Channel Architecture]]. The MCA bus was not received well by the customer base for PC's, since it was proprietary to IBM. It was rarely implemented by any of the other PC-compatible makers. Eventually IBM would abandon this architecture entirely and return to the standard ISA bus.\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:IBM PC Motherboard (1981).jpg|thumb|Original IBM Personal Computer motherboard, IBM 5150. It has five expansion slots (an interface later called \"PC/XT-bus\" by IBM and \"8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]\" by other manufacturers of compatible computers), and two DIN connectors for keyboard and cassette interface.]]\nThe main circuit board in an PC is called the [[motherboard]] (IBM terminology calls it a ''planar''). This mainly carries the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[computer memory|RAM]], and it has a [[computer bus|bus]] with slots for expansion cards. On the motherboard are also the ROM subsystem, DMA and IRQ controllers, coprocessor socket, sound (PC speaker, tone generation) circuitry, and keyboard interface. The original PC also has a cassette interface.\n\nThe bus used in the original PC became very popular, and it was subsequently named [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]. While it was popular, it was more commonly known as the PC-bus or XT-bus; the term ''ISA'' arose later when industry leaders chose to continue manufacturing machines based on the IBM PC AT architecture rather than license the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] architecture and its [[Micro Channel architecture|Micro Channel]] bus from IBM. The XT-bus was then retroactively named ''8-bit ISA'' or ''XT ISA'', while the unqualified term ''ISA'' usually refers to the 16-bit AT-bus (as better defined in the ISA specifications). The AT-bus is an extension of the PC-/XT-bus and is in use to this day in computers for industrial use, where its relatively low speed, 5 volt signals, and relatively simple, straightforward design (all by year 2011 standards) give it technical advantages (e.g. noise immunity for reliability).\n\n[[File:KL Quadram Quadboard.jpg|right|thumb|Quadram Quadboard.]]\nA monitor and any floppy or hard disk drives are connected to the motherboard through cables connected to graphics adapter and disk controller cards, respectively, installed in expansion slots. Each expansion slot on the motherboard has a corresponding opening in the back of the computer case through which the card can expose connectors; a blank metal cover plate covers this case opening (to prevent dust and debris intrusion and control airflow) when no expansion card is installed. Memory expansion beyond the amount installable on the motherboard was also done with boards installed in expansion slots, and I/O devices such as parallel, serial, or network ports were likewise installed as individual expansion boards. For this reason, it was easy to fill the five expansion slots of the PC, or even the eight slots of the XT, even without installing any special hardware. Companies like Quadram and AST addressed this with their popular multi-I/O cards which combine several peripherals on one adapter card that uses only one slot; Quadram offered the QuadBoard and AST the SixPak.\n\n[[Intel]] 8086 and [[Intel 8088|8088]]-based PCs require [[expanded memory]] (EMS) boards to work with more than 640&nbsp;kB of memory. (Though the 8088 can address one [[megabyte]] of memory, the last 384&nbsp;kB of that is used or reserved for the BIOS ROM, BASIC ROM, extension ROMs installed on adapter cards, and memory address space used by devices including display adapter RAM and even the 64&nbsp;kB EMS page frame itself.) The original IBM PC AT used an [[Intel 80286]] processor which can access up to 16&nbsp;MB of memory (though standard [[DOS]] applications cannot use more than one megabyte without using additional APIs). Intel 80286-based computers running under [[OS/2]] can work with the maximum memory.\n\n===Peripheral integrated circuits===\nThe set of peripheral chips selected for the original IBM PC defined the functionality of an IBM compatible. These became the de facto base for later [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs) used in compatible products.\n\nThe original system chips were one [[Intel 8259]] programmable interrupt controller (PIC) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x20}}), one [[Intel 8237]] direct memory access (DMA) controller (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x00}}), and an [[Intel 8253]] programmable interval timer (PIT) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x40}}). The PIT provides the {{nowrap|18.2 Hz}} clock ticks, dynamic memory refresh timing, and can be used for speaker output;<ref>[http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html wustl.edu - ECE306 Lecture 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180117/http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/lecture/l16.html |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref> one DMA channel is used to perform the memory refresh.\n\nThe mathematics [[coprocessor]] was the Intel [[x87#8087|8087]] using I/O address 0xF0. This was an option for users who needed extensive floating-point arithmetic, such as users of computer-aided drafting.\n\nThe IBM PC AT added a second, slave 8259 PIC (at I/O address {{nowrap|0xA0}}), a second 8237 DMA controller for 16-bit DMA (at I/O address {{nowrap|0xC0}}), a DMA address register (implemented with a 74LS612 IC) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x80}}),<ref>The DMA address register extends the 16-bit transfer memory address capacity of the 8237 to 24 bits</ref> and a [[Motorola]] MC146818 [[real-time clock]] (RTC) with [[nonvolatile BIOS memory|nonvolatile memory]] (NVRAM) used for system configuration (replacing the DIP switches and jumpers used for this purpose in PC and PC/XT models (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x70}}).<ref>[http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece391/references/mc146818.pdf illinois.edu - Real time clock plus RAM]</ref> On expansion cards, the [[Intel 8255]] programmable peripheral interface (PPI) (at I/O addresses {{nowrap|0x378}} is used for parallel I/O controls the printer,<ref>[http://www.ctv.es/pckits/tutorial.html ctv.se - PC KITS-tutorial page (parallel port, joystick port)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728124053/http://www.ctv.es/pckits/tutorial.html |date=2011-07-28 }}</ref> and the [[8250 UART|8250]] universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) (at I/O address {{nowrap|0x3F8}} or {{nowrap|0x3E8}}) controls the serial communication at the (pseudo-)<ref>The IBM PC serial port is not strictly RS-232, since it uses TTL signal levels, whereas RS-232 requires signals of +/- 3 to 15 volts; some signal levels that are valid for a TTL high state, and all signal levels that represent a TTL low state, fall within the forbidden range of -3 to +3 volts for standard RS-232. (However, it is not difficult to design and construct a level converter that will convert between IBM serial port and standard RS-232 signals.)</ref> [[RS-232]] port.\n\n===Joystick port===\nIBM offered a [[Game Control Adapter]] for the PC,{{r|lemmons198110}} which supported analog joysticks similar to those on the Apple II. Although analog controls proved inferior for arcade-style games, they were an asset in certain other genres such as [[flight simulator]]s. The joystick port on the IBM PC supported two controllers, but required a Y-splitter cable to connect both at once. It remained the standard joystick interface on IBM compatibles until being replaced by [[USB]] during the 2000s.\n\n===Keyboard===\n{{main|IBM PC keyboard}}\n[[File:IBM_Model_F_XT.png|thumb|The original keyboard for the IBM 5150 and XT]]\n\nThe keyboard that came with the IBM 5150 was an extremely reliable and high-quality electronic keyboard originally developed in North Carolina for the Datamaster.{{r|bradley199009}} Each key was rated to be reliable to over 100 million keystrokes. For the IBM PC, a separate keyboard housing was designed with a novel usability feature that allowed users to adjust the keyboard angle for personal comfort. Compared with the keyboards of other small computers at the time, the [[IBM PC keyboard]] was far superior and played a significant role in establishing a high-quality impression. For example, the industrial design of the adjustable keyboard, together with the system unit, was recognized with a major design award.<ref name=ID/> ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine in the fall of 1981 went so far as to state that the keyboard was 50% of the reason to buy an IBM PC. The importance of the keyboard was definitely established when the 1983 [[IBM PCjr]] flopped, in very large part for having a much different and mediocre [[Chiclet keyboard]] that made a poor impression on customers. Oddly enough, the same thing almost happened to the original IBM PC when in early 1981 management seriously considered substituting a cheaper and lower quality keyboard. This mistake was narrowly avoided on the advice of one of the original development engineers.\n\nHowever, the original 1981 IBM PC 83-key [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] was criticized by typists for its non-standard placement of the {{Key press |[[Return key|Return]]}} and left {{Key press |[[Shift key|Shift]]}} keys, and because it did not have separate cursor and numeric pads that were popular on the pre-PC [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT100]] series video terminals. In 1982, [[Key Tronic]] introduced a 101-key PC keyboard, albeit not with the now-familiar layout. In 1984, IBM corrected the {{Key press |Return}} and left {{Key press |Shift}} keys on its AT keyboard, but shortened the {{Key press |[[Backspace key|Backspace]]}} key, making it harder to reach. In 1986, IBM introduced the 101 key [[Enhanced Keyboard]], which added the separate cursor and numeric key pads, relocated all the function keys and the {{Key press |[[Ctrl key|Ctrl]]}} keys, and the {{Key press |[[Esc key|Esc]]}} key was also relocated to the opposite side of the keyboard. The Enhanced Keyboard was an option for the PC XT/AT in 1986, both of which were also available with their original keyboards, and introduced the key layout that's still the industry standard.\n\nAnother feature of the original keyboard is the relatively loud \"click\" sound each key made when pressed. Since typewriter users were accustomed to keeping their eyes on the hardcopy they were typing from and had come to rely on the mechanical sound that was made as each character was typed onto the paper to ensure that they had pressed the key hard enough (and only once), the PC keyboard used a keyswitch that produced a click and tactile bump intended to provide that same reassurance.\n\nThe IBM PC keyboard is very robust and flexible. The low-level interface for each key is the same: each key sends a signal when it is pressed and another signal when it is released. An integrated microcontroller in the keyboard scans the keyboard and encodes a \"scan code\" and \"release code\" for each key as it is pressed and released separately. Any key can be used as a shift key, and a large number of keys can be held down simultaneously and separately sensed. The controller in the keyboard handles typematic operation, issuing periodic repeat scan codes for a depressed key and then a single release code when the key is finally released.\n\nAn \"IBM PC compatible\" may have a keyboard that does not recognize every key combination a true IBM PC does, such as shifted cursor keys. In addition, the \"compatible\" vendors sometimes used proprietary keyboard interfaces, preventing the keyboard from being replaced.\n\nAlthough the PC/XT and AT used the same style of keyboard connector, the low-level protocol for reading the keyboard was different between these two series. The AT keyboard uses a bidirectional interface which allows the computer to send commands to the keyboard. An AT keyboard could not be used in an XT, nor the reverse. Third-party keyboard manufacturers provided a switch on some of their keyboards to select either the AT-style or XT-style protocol for the keyboard.\n\n{{See also|Keyboard layout}}\n\n===Character set===\nThe original IBM PC used the 7-bit [[ASCII]] alphabet as its basis, but extended it to 8 bits with nonstandard character codes. This character set was not suitable for some international applications, and soon a veritable cottage industry emerged providing variants of the original character set in various national variants. In IBM tradition, these variants were called [[code page]]s. These codings are now obsolete, having been replaced by more systematic and standardized forms of character coding, such as [[ISO 8859-1]], [[Windows-1251]] and [[Unicode]]. The original character set is known as [[code page 437]].\n\n===Storage media===\n\n====Cassette tape====\n{{Main|IBM cassette tape}}\n\nIBM equipped the model 5150 with a cassette port for connecting a [[Compact cassette#Data recording|cassette]] drive and assumed that home users would purchase the low-end model and save files to cassette tapes as was typical of home computers of the time. However, adoption of the floppy- and monitor-less configuration was low; few (if any) IBM PCs left the factory without a floppy disk drive installed. Also, DOS was not available on cassette tape, only on floppy disks (hence \"Disk Operating System\"). 5150s with just external cassette recorders for storage could only use the built-in ROM BASIC as their operating system. As DOS saw increasing adoption, the incompatibility of DOS programs with PCs that used only cassettes for storage made this configuration even less attractive. The ROM BIOS supported cassette operations.\n\n[[IBM Cassette tape|The IBM PC cassette interface]] encodes data using frequency modulation with a variable data rate. Either a one or a zero is represented by a single cycle of a square wave, but the square wave frequencies differ by a factor of two, with ones having the lower frequency. Therefore, the bit periods for zeros and ones also differ by a factor of two, with the unusual effect that a data stream with more zeros than ones will use less tape (and time) than an equal-length (in bits) data stream containing more ones than zeros, or equal numbers of each.\n\nIBM also had an exclusive license agreement with Microsoft to include BASIC in the ROM of the PC; clone manufacturers could not have ROM BASIC on their machines, but it also became a problem as the XT, AT, and PS/2 eliminated the cassette port and IBM was still required to install the (now useless) BASIC with them. The agreement finally expired in 1991 when Microsoft replaced BASICA/GW-BASIC with [[QBASIC]]. The main core BASIC resided in ROM and \"linked\" up with the RAM-resident BASIC.COM/BASICA.COM included with PC-DOS (they provided disk support and other extended features not present in ROM BASIC). Because BASIC was over 50 kB in size, this served a useful function during the first three years of the PC when machines only had 64\u2013128 kB of memory, but became less important by 1985. For comparison, clone makers such as Compaq were forced to include a version of BASIC that resided entirely in RAM.\n\n====Floppy diskettes====\n[[File:IBM Floppy Drive With DOS.jpg|right|thumb|Tandon 5.25-inch [[Disk storage|Diskette Drive]] with a partially inserted double-density diskette containing DOS 1.1.]]\n\nThe first IBM 5150 PCs had two 5.25-inch 160&nbsp;KiB single sided double density (SSDD) [[floppy disk]] drives. As two heads drives became available in the spring of 1982, later IBM PC and compatible computers could read 320&nbsp;KiB double sided double density (DSDD) disks with software support of MS-DOS&nbsp;1.25 and higher. The same type of physical diskette media could be used for both drives but a disk formatted for double-sided use could not be read on a single-sided drive. PC-DOS&nbsp;2.0 added support for 180&nbsp;KiB and 360&nbsp;KiB SSDD and DSDD floppy disks, using the same physical media again.\n\nThe disks were [[Modified Frequency Modulation]] (MFM) coded in 512-byte sectors, and were soft-sectored.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM|title=Technical Reference: Personal Computer Hardware Reference Library|publisher=IBM Corp.|date=July 1982|edition=Revised|pages=2\u201393|id=6025008}}</ref> They contained 40 tracks per side at the 48 track per inch (TPI) density,<ref>Sometimes the tracks were also referred as cylinders, which is technically correct and analogous to hard drive cylinders. One floppy disk track equaled one cylinder, however with double-sided floppies, only the first side's cylinder numbers were identical to the track numbers; on the second side, the cylinders 1-40 corresponded to tracks 41-80 of the formatted floppy.<!-- Does anyone know whether SSDD drives could read files stored on the first 40 tracks of a DSDD formatted floppy?--></ref> and initially were formatted to contain eight sectors per track. This meant that SSDD disks initially had a formatted capacity of 160&nbsp;kB,<ref>163,840 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> while DSDD disks had a capacity of 320&nbsp;kB.<ref>327,680 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 8 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> However, the PC-DOS&nbsp;2.0 and later operating systems allowed formatting the disks with nine sectors per track. This yielded a formatted capacity of 180&nbsp;kB with SSDD disks/drives,<ref>184,320 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks on the one side used</ref> and 360 kB with DSDD disks/drives.<ref>368,640 bytes, i.e. 512 bytes \u00d7 9 sectors \u00d7 40 tracks \u00d7 2 sides</ref> The ''unformatted'' capacity of the floppy disks was advertised as \"250KB\" for SSDD and \"500KB\" for DSDD (\"KB\" ambiguously referring to either 1000 or 1024 bytes; essentially the same for rounded-off values), however these \"raw\" 250/500&nbsp;kB were not the same thing as the usable formatted capacity; under DOS, the maximum capacity for SSDD and DSDD disks was 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB, respectively. Regardless of type, the [[file system]] of all floppy disks (under DOS) was [[FAT12]].\n\nAfter the upgraded 64k-256k motherboard PCs arrived in early 1983, single-sided drives and the cassette model were discontinued.\n\nIBM's original floppy disk controller card also included an external 37-pin D-shell connector. This allowed users to connect additional external floppy drives by third party vendors, but IBM did not offer their own external floppies until 1986.\n\nThe industry-standard way of setting floppy drive numbers was via setting jumper switches on the drive unit, however IBM chose to instead use a method known as the \"cable twist\" which had a floppy data cable with a bend in the middle of it that served as a switch for the drive motor control. This eliminated the need for users to adjust jumpers while installing a floppy drive.\n\n====Fixed disks====\n[[File:ST 225 20MB drive and WDC controller.jpg|thumb|20MB [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] ST-225 with a controller card by [[Western Digital]]]]\n\nThe 5150 could not itself power hard drives without retrofitting a stronger power supply, but IBM later offered the 5161 Expansion Unit, which not only provided more expansion slots, but also included a 10&nbsp;MB (later 20&nbsp;MB) hard drive powered by the 5161's own separate 130-watt power supply. The IBM 5161 Expansion Unit was released in early 1983.\n\nDuring the first year of the IBM PC, it was commonplace for users to install third-party Winchester hard disks which generally connected to the floppy controller and required a patched version of PC-DOS which treated them as a giant floppy disk (there was no subdirectory support).\n\nIBM began offering hard disks with the XT, however the original PC was never sold with them. Nonetheless, many users installed hard disks and upgraded power supplies in them.\n\nAfter floppy disks became obsolete in the early 2000s, the letters A and B became unused. But for 25 years, virtually all DOS-based PC software assumed the program installation drive was C, so the primary HDD continues to be \"the C drive\" even today.\nOther operating system families (e.g. Unix) are not bound to these designations.\n\n====OS support====\n[[File:IBM DOS 1.1 Manual and Disk.jpg|right|upright|thumb|IBM Disk Operating System version 1.1 by Microsoft]]\n\nWhich operating system IBM customers would choose was at first unclear.<ref name=\"freibergeros19811005\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA3&ots=UIUJBsfNdl&pg=RA1-PA50#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Some Confusion at the Heart of IBM Microcomputer / Which Operating System Will Prevail? | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-10-05 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=50\u201351}}</ref>{{r|morgan198201}} Although the company expected that most would use [[PC DOS]]{{r|bunnell19820405}} IBM supported using [[CP/M-86]]\u2014which became available six months after DOS<ref name=\"edlin19820607\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&lpg=RA2-PA18&pg=RA2-PA43#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=CP/M Arrives | work=PC Magazine | date=June\u2013July 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Edlin, Jim | page=43}}</ref>\u2014or [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] as operating systems.{{r|lemmons198110}} IBM promised that it would not favor one operating system over the others; the CP/M-86 support surprised Gates, who claimed that IBM was \"blackmailed into it\".{{r|freibergeros19811005}} IBM was correct, nonetheless, in its expectation; one survey found that 96.3% of PCs were ordered with the $40 DOS compared to 3.4% for the $240 CP/M-86.<ref name=\"pcommuniques198302\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wCiNAUEuAMC&lpg=PA360&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=PCommuniques | work=PC Magazine | date=February 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe IBM PC's ROM BASIC and BIOS supported cassette tape storage. PC DOS itself did not support cassette tape storage. PC DOS version 1.00 supported only 160&nbsp;kB SSDD floppies, but version 1.1, which was released nine months after the PC's introduction, supported 160&nbsp;kB SSDD and 320&nbsp;kB DSDD floppies. Support for the slightly larger nine sector per track 180&nbsp;kB and 360&nbsp;kB formats arrived 10 months later in March 1983.\n\n===BIOS===\nThe [[BIOS]] (Basic Input/Output System) provided the core ROM code for the PC. It contained a library of functions that software could call for basic tasks such as video output, keyboard input, and disk access in addition to interrupt handling, loading the operating system on boot-up, and testing memory and other system components.\n\nThe original IBM PC BIOS was 8k in size and occupied four 2k ROM chips on the motherboard, with a fifth and sixth empty slot left for any extra ROMs the user wished to install. IBM offered three different BIOS revisions during the PC's lifespan. The initial BIOS was dated April 1981 and came on the earliest models with single-sided floppy drives and PC DOS 1.00. The second version was dated October 1981 and arrived on the \"Revision B\" models sold with double-sided drives and PC DOS 1.10. It corrected some bugs, but was otherwise unchanged. Finally, the third BIOS version was dated October 1982 and found on all IBM PCs with the newer 64k-256k motherboard. This revision was more-or-less identical to the XT's BIOS. It added support for detecting ROMs on expansion cards as well as the ability to use 640k of memory (the earlier BIOS revisions had a limit of 544k). Unlike the XT, the original PC remained functionally unchanged from 1983 until its discontinuation in early 1987 and did not get support for 101-key keyboards or 3.5\" floppy drives, nor was it ever offered with half-height floppies.\n\n===Video output===\nIBM initially offered two video adapters for the PC, the [[Color Graphics Adapter|Color/Graphics Adapter]] and the [[Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter]]. CGA was intended to be a typical home computer display; it had NTSC output and could be connected to a composite monitor or a TV set with an RF modulator in addition to RGB for digital RGBI-type monitors, although IBM did not offer their own RGB monitor until 1983. Supported graphics modes were 40 or 80\u00d725 color text with 8\u00d78 character resolution, 320\u00d7200 bitmap graphics with two fixed 4-color palettes, or 640\u00d7200 monochrome graphics.\n\nThe MDA card and its companion 5151 monitor supported only 80\u00d725 text with a 9\u00d714 character resolution (total pixel resolution was 720\u00d7350). It was mainly intended for the business market and so also included a printer port.\n\nDuring 1982, the first third-party video card for the PC appeared when Hercules Computer Technologies released a clone of the MDA that could use bitmap graphics. Although not supported by the BIOS, the [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules Graphics Adapter]] became extremely popular for business use due to allowing sharp, high resolution graphics plus text and itself was widely cloned by other manufacturers.\n\nIn 1985, after the launch of the IBM AT, the new [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] became available which could support 320\u00d7200 or 640\u00d7200 in 16 colors in addition to high-resolution 640\u00d7350 16 color graphics.\n\nIBM also offered a video board for the PC, XT, and AT known as the [[Professional Graphics Adapter]] during 1984\u201386, mainly intended for CAD design. It was extremely expensive, required a special monitor, and was rarely ordered by customers.\n\n[[VGA]] graphics cards could also be installed in IBM PCs and XTs, although they were introduced after the computer's discontinuation.\n\n===Serial port addresses and interrupts===\nThe [[serial port]] is an [[8250 UART|8250]] or a derivative (such as the 16450 or [[16550 UART|16550]]), mapped to eight consecutive IO addresses and one interrupt request line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! COM port\n! IRQ\n! Base port address &#91;[[Hexadecimal|Hex]]&#93;\n|-\n| COM1\n| IRQ4\n| 3F8\n|-\n| COM2\n| IRQ3\n| 2F8\n|-\n| COM3\n| IRQ4\n| 3E8\n|-\n| COM4\n| IRQ3\n| 2E8\n|}\n\nOnly COM1: and COM2: addresses were defined by the original PC. Attempts to share IRQ3 and IRQ4 to use additional ports require special measures in hardware and software, since shared IRQs were not defined in the original PC design. The most typical devices plugged into the serial port were [[modem]]s and [[mouse (computing)|mice]]. [[Plotter]]s and serial printers were also among the more commonly used serial peripherals, and there were numerous other more unusual uses such as operating [[cash register]]s, factory equipment, and connecting [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Printer port===\nIBM made a deal with Japan-based [[Epson]] to produce printers for the PC and all IBM-branded printers were manufactured by that company (Epson of course also sold printers with their own name). There was a considerable amount of controversy when IBM included a printer port on the PC that did not follow the industry-standard [[Centronics]] design, and it was rumored that this had been done to prevent customers from using non-Epson/IBM printers with their machines (plugging a Centronics printer into an IBM PC could damage the printer, the parallel port, or both). Although third-party cards were available with Centronics ports on them, PC clones quickly copied the IBM printer port and by the late 80s, it had largely displaced the Centronics standard.\n\n==Reception==\n''BYTE'' wrote in October 1981 that the IBM PC's \"hardware is impressive, but even more striking are two decisions made by IBM: to use outside suppliers already established in the microcomputer industry, and to provide information and assistance to independent, small-scale software writers and manufacturers of peripheral devices\". It praised the \"smart\" hardware design and stated that its price was not much higher than the 8-bit machines from Apple and others. The reviewer admitted that the computer \"came as a shock. I expected that the giant would stumble by overestimating or underestimating the capabilities the public wants and stubbornly insisting on incompatibility with the rest of the microcomputer world.

The magazine praised the keyboard as \"bar none, the best ... on any microcomputer\", describing the unusual Shift key locations as \"minor [problems] compared to some of the gigantic mistakes made on almost every other microcomputer keyboard\". The review also complimented IBM's manuals, which it predicted \"will set the standard for all microcomputer documentation in the future. Not only are they well packaged, well organized, and easy to understand, but they are also ''complete''\". Observing that detailed technical information was available \"much earlier ... than it has been for other machines\", the magazine predicted that \"given a reasonable period of time, plenty of hardware and software will probably be developed for\" the computer. The review stated that although the IBM PC cost more than comparably configured Apple II and TRS-80 computers, and the insufficient number of slots for all desirable expansion cards was its most serious weakness, \"you get a ''lot'' more for your money\" and concluded, \"In two years or so, I think [it] will be one of the most popular and best-supported ...

In June 2006, IBM PC and XT models were still in use at the majority of U.S. [[National Weather Service]] upper-air observing sites, used to process data as it is returned from the ascending [[radiosonde]], attached to a [[weather balloon]], although they have been slowly phased out. Factors that have contributed to the 5150 PC's longevity are its flexible modular design, its open technical standard (making information needed to adapt, modify, and repair it readily available), use of few special nonstandard parts, and rugged high-standard IBM manufacturing, which provided for exceptional long-term reliability and durability.\n\nSome of the mechanical aspects of the slot specifications are still used in current PCs. A few systems still come with PS/2 style keyboard and mouse connectors.\n\n==Collectability==\nThe IBM model 5150 Personal Computer has become a collectable among vintage computer collectors, due to the system being the first true \u201cPC\u201d as we know them today. {{As of|2007}}, the system had a market value of $50\u2013$500.<ref name=\"McCracken2007\">{{cite web|last1=McCracken|first1=Harry|title=The Most Collectible PCs of All Time|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/136242/article.html|website=PCWorld|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=en|date=27 August 2007}}</ref>  The IBM model 5150 has proven to be reliable; despite their age of 30 years or more, some still function as they did when new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/237878/can_you_do_real_work_with_the_30yearold_ibm_5150.html|title=Can You Do Real Work With the 30-Year-Old IBM 5150?|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Information technology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[386SLC]]\n*[[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]]\n*[[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]]\n*[[Atari ST]]\n*[[Aptiva]]\n*[[Conventional memory]]\n*[[IBM 4860]]\n*[[IBM 5120]]\n*[[IBM 5155]]\n*[[IBM token ring]] networks\n*[[Input/Output Base Address]]\n*[[List of IBM products]]\n*[[ThinkCentre]]\n*[[ThinkPad]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n;Cited references\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;General references\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Norton, Peter (1986).

These land divisions were formed following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in imitation of the [[county|counties]] then in use as units of local government in the [[Kingdom of England]].<ref>Bryne, T., ''Local Government in Britain'', (1994)</ref> The older term \"[[shire]]\" was historically equivalent to \"county\". The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation, security and the [[administration of justice]] at the local level. [[Cambro-Norman]] control was initially limited to the southeastern parts of Ireland; a further four centuries elapsed before the entire island was shired. At the same time, the now obsolete concept of [[county corporate]] elevated a small number of towns and cities to a status which was deemed to be no less important than the existing counties in which they lay. This double control mechanism of 32 counties plus 10 counties corporate remained unchanged for a little over two centuries until the early 19th century. Since then, counties have been adapted and in some cases divided by legislation to meet new administrative and political requirements.\n\nThe powers exercised by the Cambro-Norman barons and the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] nobility waned over time. New offices of political control came to be established at a county level. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], some counties have been split resulting in the creation of new counties. Along with certain defined cities, counties still form the basis for the demarcation of areas of [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]]. Currently, there are 26 county level, 3 city level and 2 city and county entities \u2013 the modern equivalent of counties corporate \u2013 that are used to demarcate areas of local government in the Republic.\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] are no longer used for local government; [[Local government in Northern Ireland|districts]] are instead used. Upon the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921, the county became one of the basic land divisions employed, along with county boroughs.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word \"county\" has come to be used in different senses for different purposes. In common usage, many people have in mind the 32 counties that existed prior to 1838 \u2013 the so-called traditional counties. However, in official usage in the Republic of Ireland, the term often refers to the 28 modern counties. The term is also conflated with the 31 areas currently used to demarcate areas of [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]] at the level of [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland|LAU 1]].\n\nIn Ireland, usage of the word ''county'' nearly always comes before rather than after the county name; thus \"[[County Roscommon|''County'' Roscommon]]\" in Ireland as opposed to \"[[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon ''County'']]\" in [[Michigan]], United States. The former \"King's County\" and \"Queen's County\" were exceptions; these are now [[County Offaly]] and [[County Laois]], respectively. The [[abbreviation]] Co. is used, as in \"Co. Roscommon\". A further exception occurs in the case of those counties created after 1994 which often drop the word ''county'' entirely, or use it after the name; thus for example internet search engines show many more uses (on Irish sites) of \"[[Fingal]]\" than of either \"County Fingal\" or \"Fingal County\". There appears to be no official guidance in the matter, as even the local council uses all three forms.<ref>[http://www.fingalcoco.ie/ Fingal County Council website], where (apart from references to the Council itself) both \"Fingal County\" and \"County Fingal\" appear, but much less frequently than \"Fingal\" alone.</ref> In informal use, the word ''county'' is often dropped except where necessary to distinguish between county and town or city; thus \"Offaly\" rather than \"County Offaly\", but \"County Antrim\" to distinguish it from Antrim town. The synonym ''[[shire]]'' is not used for Irish counties, although the [[Marquess of Downshire|Marquessate of Downshire]] was named in 1789 after [[County Down]].\n\nParts of some towns and cities were exempt from the jurisdiction of the counties that surrounded them. These towns and cities had the status of a [[County corporate]], many granted by Royal Charter, which had all the judicial, administrative and revenue raising powers of the regular counties.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Norman divisions of Ireland===\nThe [[political geography]] of Ireland can be traced with some accuracy from the 6th century. At that time Ireland was divided into a patchwork of [[petty kingdom]]s with a fluid political hierarchy which, in general, had three traditional grades of king.  The lowest level of political control existed at the level of the ''[[t\u00faath]]'' (pl. ''t\u00faatha''). A ''t\u00faath'' was an autonomous group of people of independent political jurisdiction under a r\u00ed t\u00faaithe, that is, a local petty king.<ref>Michael Richter, ''Medieval Ireland'', Revised edition, Dublin 2005</ref> About 150 such units of government existed. Each  ''r\u00ed t\u00faaithe'' was in turn subject to a regional or \"over-king\" ({{lang-ga|ruiri}}). There may have been as many as 20 genuine [[R\u00ed#Ruiri|ruiri]] in Ireland at any time.\n\nA \"king of over-kings\" ({{lang-ga|r\u00ed ruirech|links=no}}) was often a provincial ({{lang-ga|r\u00ed c\u00f3icid|links=no}}) or semi-provincial king to whom several ruiri were subordinate. No more than six genuine [[R\u00ed#R\u00ed ruirech|r\u00ed ruirech]] were ever contemporary. Usually, only five such \"king of over-kings\" existed contemporaneously and so are described in the [[Irish annals]] as ''fifths'' ({{lang-ga|c\u00faig\u00ed|links=no}}). The areas under the control of these kings were: [[Ulster]] ({{lang-ga|Ulaidh|links=no}}), [[Leinster]] ({{lang-ga|Laighin|links=no}}), [[Connacht]] ({{lang-ga|Connachta|links=no}}), [[Munster]] ({{lang-ga|An Mhumhan|links=no}}) and [[Kingdom of Meath|Mide]] ({{lang-ga|An Mh\u00eddhe|links=no}}). Later record-makers dubbed them ''provinces'', in imitation of [[Roman province]]s. In the Norman period, the historic fifths of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of [[the Pale]], which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.\n\nThe use of [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]] as divisions of political power was supplanted by the system of counties after the Norman invasion. In modern times clusters of counties have been attributed to certain provinces but these clusters have no legal status. They are today seen mainly in a sporting context, as Ireland's four professional rugby teams play under the names of the provinces, and the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] has separate [[GAA provincial council|Provincial council]]s and [[Provincial championships]].\n\n===Plantagenet era===\n====Lordships====\nWith the arrival of [[Cambro-Norman]] knights in 1169, the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] commenced. This was followed in 1172 by the invasion of King [[Henry II of England]], commencing English royal involvement.<ref group=\"nb\">Whilst often today called English, a term which would not have been understood at the time, Henry II was in fact a Norman Frenchman, born in [[Le Mans]] and spent most of his early life there. His accession, which was essentially by force from his mother's cousin Stephen, was the continuance of the Norman subjugation of England</ref>\n\nAfter his intervention in Ireland, Henry II effectively divided the English colony into liberties also known as lordships. These were effectively [[county palatine|palatine counties]] and differed from ordinary counties in that they were disjoined from the crown and that whoever they were granted to essentially had the same authority as the king and that the king's writ had no effect except a writ of error.<ref name=\"Falkiner\">{{Cite book |title=The Counties of Ireland: An Historical Sketch of Their Origin, Constitution, and Gradual Delimitation|last=Falkiner|first=Caesar Litton|publisher=Royal Irish Academy}}</ref> This covered all land within the county that was not church land.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> The reasons for the creating of such powerful entities in Ireland was due to the lack of authority the English crown had there.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> The same process occurred after the Norman conquest of England where despite there being a strong central government, county palatines were needed in border areas with Wales and Scotland.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> In Ireland this meant that the land was divided and granted to [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]] and his followers who became lords (and sometimes called earls), with the only land which the English crown had any direct control over being the sea-coast towns and territories immediately adjacent.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nOf Henry II's grants, at least three of them\u2014[[Leinster]] to Richard de Clare; [[Lordship of Meath|Meath]] to [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]]; [[Lordship of Ulster|Ulster]] to [[John de Courcy]]\u2014were equivalent to palatine counties in their bestowing of royal jurisdiction to the grantees.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Other grants include the liberties of Connaught and Tipperary.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\n====Division of lordships====\n[[File:Www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1300.gif|thumb|right|Extent of Norman control in Ireland by 1300]]\n[[Image:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|right|The Pale (grey), earldoms and lordships (blue) in 1450]]\nThese initial lordships were later subdivided into smaller \"liberties\", which appear to have enjoyed the same privileges as their predecessors.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> The division of Leinster and Munster into smaller counties is commonly attributed to King John, mostly due to lack of prior documentary evidence, which has been destroyed. However, they may have had an earlier origin.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> These counties were: in Leinster: Carlow (also known as Catherlogh), Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth (also known as Uriel), Meath, Wexford, Waterford; in Munster: Cork, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> It is thought that these counties did not have the administrative purpose later attached to them until late in the reign of King John, and that no new counties were created until the Tudor dynasty.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nThe most important office in those that were [[palatine]] was that of [[seneschal]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> In those liberties that came under Crown control this office was held by a [[sheriff]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> The sovereign could and did appoint sheriffs in palatines; however, their power was confined to the church lands, and they became known as sheriffs of a County of the Cross, of which there seem to have been as many in Ireland as there were counties palatine.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nThe exact boundaries of the liberties and shrievalties appears to have been in constant flux throughout the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] period, seemingly in line with the extent of English control.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> For example, in 1297 it is recorded that Kildare had extended to include the lands that now comprise the modern-day counties of Offaly, Laois (Leix) and Wicklow (Arklow).<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Some attempts had also been made to extend the county system to Ulster.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nHowever the [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Bruce Invasion of Ireland]] in 1315 resulted in the collapse of effective English rule in Ireland, with the land controlled by the crown continually shrinking to encompass Dublin, and parts of Meath, Louth and Kildare.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Throughout the rest of Ireland, English rule was upheld by the earls of Desmond, Ormond, and Kildare (all created in the 14th-century), with the extension of the county system all but impossible.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> During the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (1327\u201377) all franchises, grants and liberties had been temporarily revoked with power passed to the king's sheriffs over the seneschals.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> This may have been due to the disorganisation caused by the Bruce invasion as well as the renouncing of the Connaught Burkes of their alligence to the crown.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nThe Earls of Ulster divided their territory up into counties; however, these are not considered part of the Crown's shiring of Ireland. In 1333, the [[Earldom of Ulster]] is recorded as consisting of seven counties: [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[Newtownards|Blathewyc]], [[Carrickfergus|Cragferus]], [[County Coleraine|Coulrath]], [[Ards (territory)|del Art]], [[County Down|Dun]] (also known as [[Lecale|Ladcathel]]), and [[Twescard]].<ref name=\"Bardon2005pg45\">Bardon, Jonathan: ''A History of Ulster'', page 45.

This marriage was confirmed by [[John, King of England|King John]], with Isabel's lands given to William as consort. The liberty was afterwards divided into five\u2014Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leix and Wexford\u2014one for each of Marshal's co-heiresses.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n*Meath was divided between the granddaughters of [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]]: [[Maud de Lacy, Baroness Geneville|Maud]] and Margery. Maud's half became the liberty of Trim, and she married [[Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville|Geoffrey de Geneville]]. Margery's half retained the name Meath, and she married John de Verdon. After the marriage of Maud's daughter [[Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville|Joan]] to [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], Trim later passed via their descendants to the English Crown. Meath, which had passed to the Talbots, was resumed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] under the [[Statute of Absentees]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n*Ulster was regranted to the de Lacys from John de Courcy, whilst Connaught, which had been granted to [[William de Burgh]], was at some point divided into the liberties of Connaught and Roscommon. William's grandson [[Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster|Walter de Burgh]] was in 1264 also made lord of Ulster, bringing both Connaught and Ulster under the same lord. In 1352 [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster]] married [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]], a son of king [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Their daughter [[Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster|Philippa]] married [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]]. Upon the death of [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]] in 1425, both lordships were inherited by [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]] and thus passed to the Crown.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n*Tipperary was resumed by King [[James VI and I|James I]], however under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1662 was reconstituted for [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nWith the passing of liberties to the Crown, the number of Counties of the Cross declined, and only one, Tipperary, survived into the Stuart era; the others had ceased to exist by the reign of Henry VIII.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\n===Tudor era===\nIt was not until the Tudors, specifically the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (1509\u201347), that crown control started to once again extend throughout Ireland.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Having declared himself [[King of Ireland]] in 1541, Henry VIII went about converting Irish chiefs into feudal subjects of the crown with land divided into districts, which were eventually amalgamated into the modern counties.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> County boundaries were still ill-defined; however, in 1543 Meath was split into Meath and Westmeath.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Around 1545, the [[Byrne]]s and [[O'Toole (surname)|O'Tooles]], both native septs who had constantly been a pain for the English administration of the Pale, petitioned the Lord Deputy of Ireland to turn their district into its own county, Wicklow, however this was ignored.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nDuring the reigns of the last two Tudor monarchs, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553\u201358) and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1568\u20131603), the majority of the work for the foundation of the modern counties was carried out under the auspices of three [[Lord Deputy of Ireland|Lord Deputies]]: [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], Sir [[Henry Sidney|Henry Sydney]], and Sir [[John Perrot]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nMary's reign saw the first addition of actual new counties since the reign of King John. Radclyffe had conquered the districts of Glenmaliry, Irry, Leix, Offaly, and Slewmargy from the O'Moores and O'Connors, and in 1556 a statute decreed that Offaly and part of Glenmaliry would be made into the county of [[County Offaly|King's County]], whilst the rest of Glenmarliry along with Irry, Leix and Slewmargy was formed into [[County Laois|Queen's County]].<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> Radclyffe brought forth legislation to shire all land as yet unshired throughout Ireland and sought to divide the island into six parts\u2014Connaught, Leinster, Meath, Nether Munster, Ulster, and Upper Munster. However, his administrative reign in Ireland was cut short, and it was not until the reign of Mary's successor, Elizabeth, that this legislation was re-adopted. Under Elizabeth, Radclyffe was brought back to implement it.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nSydney during his three tenures as Lord Deputy created two presidencies to administer Connaught and Munster. He shired Connaught into the counties of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> In 1565 the territory of the O'Rourkes within Roscommon was made into the county of Leitrim. In an attempt to reduce the importance of the province of Munster, Sydney, using the [[River Shannon]] as a natural boundary took the former kingdom of Thomond (North Munster) and made it into the county of Clare as part of the presidency of Connaught in 1569.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> A commission headed by Perrot and others in 1571 declared that the territory of Desmond in Munster was to be made a county of itself, and it had its own sheriff appointed, however in 1606 it was merged with the county of Kerry.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> In 1575 Sydney made an expedition to Ulster to plan its shiring.

In 1598 Meath is considered a province in Hayne's ''Description of Ireland'', and included the counties of Cavan, East Meath, Longford, and Westmeath.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> This contrasts to [[George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes|George Carew]]'s 1602 survey where there were only four provinces with Longford part of Connaught and Cavan not mentioned at all with only three counties mentioned for Ulster.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> During Perrot's tenure as [[Lord President of Munster]] before he became Lord Deputy, Munster contained as many as eight counties rather than the six it later consisted of.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> These eight counties were: the five English counties of Cork, Limerick, Kerry, Tipperary, and Waterford; and the three Irish counties of Desmond, Ormond, and Thomond.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nPerrot's divisions in Ulster were for the main confirmed by a series of inquisitions between 1606 and 1610 that settled the demarcation of the counties of Connaught and Ulster.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> [[John Speed]]'s ''Description of the Kingdom of Ireland'' in 1610 showed that there was still a vagueness over what counties constituted the provinces, however Meath was no longer reckoned a province.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> By 1616 when the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] Sir [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]] departed Ireland, almost all counties had been delimited.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/> The only exception was the county of Tipperary, which still belonged to the palatinate of Ormond.<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\nTipperary would remain an anomaly being in effect two counties, one palatine, the other of the Cross until 1715 during the reign of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] where an act abolished the \"royalties and liberties of the County of Tipperary\" and \"that whatsoever hath been denominated or called Tipperary or Cross Tipperary, shall henceforth be and remain one county for ever, under the name of the County of Tipperary.\"<ref name=\"Falkiner\"/>\n\n===Sub-divisions of counties===\nTo correspond with the subdivisions of the English shires into honours or [[barony|baronies]], Irish counties were granted out to the Anglo-Norman noblemen in [[cantred]]s, later known as [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]], which in turn were subdivided, as in England, into [[Civil parishes in Ireland|parishes]]. Parishes were composed of [[townland]]s. However, in many cases, these divisions correspond to earlier, pre-Norman, divisions. While there are 331{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} baronies in Ireland, and more than a thousand [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parishes]], there are around sixty thousand townlands that range in size from one to several thousand hectares. Townlands were often traditionally divided into smaller units called ''quarters'', but these subdivisions are not legally defined.\n\n===Counties corporate===\nThe following towns/cities had charters specifically granting them the status of a [[county corporate]]:\n* County of the Town of [[Carrickfergus]] (by 1325)\n* County of the City of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] (1608)\n* County of the Town of [[Drogheda]] (1412)\n* County of the City of [[Dublin]] (1548)\n* County of the Town of [[Galway]] (1610)\n* County of the City of [[Kilkenny]] (1610)\n* County of the City of [[Limerick]] (1609)\n* County of the City of [[Waterford]] (1574)\nThe only entirely new counties created in 1898 were the county boroughs of Londonderry and Belfast. Carrickfergus, Drogheda and Kilkenny were abolished; Galway was also abolished, but recreated in 1986.\n\n===Exceptions to the county system of control===\nRegional presidencies of Connacht and Munster remained in existence until 1672, with special powers over their subsidiary counties.  Tipperary remained a [[county palatine]] until the passing of the [[County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715]], with different officials and procedures from other counties.  At the same time, Dublin, until the 19th century, had ecclesiastical liberties with rules outside those applying to the rest of Dublin city and county.  [[Exclaves]] of the county of Dublin existed in counties Kildare and Wicklow. At least eight other enclaves of one county inside another, or between two others, existed.  The various enclaves and exclaves were merged into neighbouring and surrounding counties, primarily in the mid-19th century under a series of Orders in Council.\n\n===Evolution of functions===\nThe [[Church of Ireland]] exercised functions at the level of civil parish that would later be exercised by county authorities. Vestigial feudal power structures of major old estates remained well into the 18th century. Urban corporations operated individual royal charters. Management of counties came to be exercised by [[Grand Jury|grand juries]]. Members of grand juries were the local payers of [[Rates (tax)|rates]] who historically held judicial functions, taking maintenance roles in regard to roads and bridges, and the collection of \"county cess\" taxes. They were usually composed of wealthy \"country gentlemen\" (i.e. landowners, farmers and merchants):<blockquote>A country gentleman as a member of a Grand Jury...levied the local taxes, appointed the nephews of his old friends to collect them, and spent them when they were gathered in. He controlled the boards of guardians and appointed the dispensary doctors, regulated the diet of paupers, inflicted fines and administered the law at petty sessions.<ref>{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=R.

The traditional county of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] was split into two judicial counties (or [[Riding (country subdivision)|riding]]s) following the establishment of [[assize court]]s in 1838. Also in that year, local poor law boards, with a mix of magistrates and elected \"guardians\" took over the health and social welfare functions of the grand juries.\n\nSixty years later, a more radical reorganisation of local government took place with the passage of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]. This Act established a county council for each of the thirty-three Irish administrative counties. Elected county councils took over the powers of the [[Grand jury|grand juries]].The boundaries of the traditional counties changed on a number of occasions. The 1898 Act changed the boundaries of Counties [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Clare|Clare]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[Roscommon]], [[County Sligo|Sligo]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]], [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Louth|Louth]], and others. County Tipperary was divided into two regions: [[North Tipperary|North Riding]] and [[South Tipperary|South Riding]]. Areas of the cities of Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Derry and Waterford were carved from their surrounding counties to become [[county borough]]s in their own right and given powers equivalent to those of administrative counties.<ref>{{cite news |title=Proposed Alterations in Counties |newspaper=Irish Times |date=19 July 1898 |page=7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=27th Report of the Local Government Board for Ireland (Cmd.9480) |chapter=Orders declaring the boundaries of administrative counties and defining county electoral divisions |year=1900 |publisher=[[HMSO]] |location=Dublin |pages=235\u2013330}}</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/handbookoflocalg00clan A Handbook of Local Government in Ireland (1899)] \"containing an Explanatory Introduction to the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898: together with the Text of the Act, the Orders in Council, and the Rules made thereunder relating to County Council, Rural District Council, and Guardian's Elections. With an Index\"</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], the island was partitioned between [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. For the purposes of the Act, <blockquote>... Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs.<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/nie/legis/num_act/1920/192000067.html Government of Ireland Act 1920 -text]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe county and county borough borders were thus used to determine the line of partition. Southern Ireland shortly afterwards became the [[Irish Free State]]. This partition was entrenched in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which was ratified in 1922, by which the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom with [[Northern Ireland]] making the decision to not separate two days later.\n\nUnder the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act 1976, part of the urban area of [[Drogheda]], which lay in County Meath, was transferred to County Louth on 1 January 1977. This resulted in the land area of County Louth increasing slightly at the expense of County Meath.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tully | first = James | title = Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1976 | work = | publisher = [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Irish Attorney General]] | date = 19 October 1976 | url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie:80/1976/en/act/prv/0001/print.html | accessdate = 22 March 2008 }}</ref> The possibility of a similar action with regard to [[Waterford City]] has been raised in recent years, though opposition from Kilkenny has been strong.\n\n====Historical and traditional counties====\nAreas that were shired by 1607 and continued as counties until the local government reforms of 1836, 1898 and 2001 are sometimes referred to as \"traditional\" or \"historic\" counties. These were distinct from the [[county corporate|counties corporate]] that existed in some of the larger towns and cities, although linked to the county at large for other purposes. From 1898 to 2001, areas with county councils were known as [[Administrative county#Ireland|administrative counties]], while the counties corporate were designated as [[county borough]]s. In other cases, the \"traditional\" county was divided to form two administrative counties. From 2001, certain administrative counties, which were originally \"traditional\" counties, underwent further splitting.\n\n==Current usage==\n\n===In the Republic of Ireland===\n{{main|Local government in the Republic of Ireland}}\n{{Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}\nIn the Republic of Ireland the traditional counties are, in general, the basis for local government, planning and community development purposes, are governed by [[county council]]s and are still generally respected for other purposes. Administrative borders have been altered to allocate various towns (e.g. [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]]) exclusively into one county having been originally split between two counties.\n\nThere are now 26 county councils, three city councils, and two city and county councils \u2013 a total of 31 local government entities.\n\n[[County Tipperary]] was split into North and South [[Riding (division)|Ridings]] in 1838. These Ridings were established as separate administrative counties under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.\n\n[[County Dublin]] was abolished as an administrative county in 1994, while also remaining a point of reference for purposes other than local government. Its territory was divided into three administrative counties: [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]], [[Fingal]], and [[South Dublin]]. The county borough of [[Dublin]], together with the county boroughs of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Galway]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]], were re-styled as [[city council]]s under the [[Local Government Act 2001]], with the same status in law as county councils.\n\nThe city councils of [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] were merged with their respective county councils by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]], to form new city and county councils. Anomalously, the city of [[Kilkenny]] does not have a \"city council\" as it was a [[borough]] but not a [[county borough]]. It is now administered by its eponymous county council but is, exceptionally, permitted to retain the style of \"city\" for ornament only. Also, the 2014 Act abolished North Tipperary and South Tipperary, and re-established County Tipperary.\n\nThese 31 \"county-level\" entities correspond to the first level of [[local administrative unit]] for EU and [[Eurostat]] purposes. The second level of local administrative unit (LAU) is the [[District electoral division]]. Of the administrative structures established under the 1898 Local Government Act, the only type to have been completely abolished was the [[Rural District]], which was rendered void in the early years of the [[Irish Free State]] amidst widespread allegations of corruption. At a level above that of LAU is the [[NUTS 2 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|Region]] which clusters counties together for [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] purposes. The Regions are administered by [[Regional Authorities in Ireland|Regional Authorities]] which were established by the [[Local Government Act 1991]] and came into existence in 1994.\n\n====Education====\nIn 2013 [[Education and Training Board]]s (ETBs) were formed throughout the Republic of Ireland, replacing the system of [[Vocational Education Committee]]s (VECs) created in 1930. Originally, VECs were formed for each administrative county and county borough, and also in a number of larger towns. In 1997 the majority of town VECs were absorbed by the surrounding county. The 33 VEC areas were reduced to 16 ETB areas, with each consisting of one or more local government county or city.<ref name=roinn>{{cite web|title=01 July, 2013\u2013 Education and Training Boards replace VECs|url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2013-Press-Releases/PR-%202013-%2007-%2001.html|publisher=[[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]]|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institute of technology]] system was organised on the committee areas or \"functional areas\", these still remain legal but are not as important as originally envisioned as the institutes are now more national in character and are only really applied today when selecting governing councils, similarly [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] was originally a group of several colleges of the [[City of Dublin]] committee.\n\n====Elections====\nWhere possible, [[D\u00e1il constituencies|parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland]] follow county boundaries. Under the Electoral Act 1997 a Constituency Commission is established following the publication of census figures every five years. The Commission is charged with defining constituency boundaries, and the 1997 Act provides that ''the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable''.<ref>[http://www.constituency-commission.ie/docs/act1997.pdf Electoral Act 1997]</ref> This provision does not apply to the boundaries between cities and counties, or between the three counties in the Dublin area.\n\nThis system usually results in more populated counties having several constituencies: Dublin, including Dublin city, is subdivided into twelve constituencies, Cork into five. On the other hand, smaller counties such as Carlow and Kilkenny or Laois and Offaly may be paired to form constituencies. An extreme case is the splitting of Ireland's least populated county of Leitrim between the constituencies of [[Sligo\u2013North Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013North Leitrim]] and [[Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim]].\n\nEach county or city is divided into [[Local electoral area]]s for the election of councillors. The boundaries of the areas and the number of councillors assigned are fixed from time to time by order of the [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government]], following a report by the Local Government Commission, and based on population changes recorded in the census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0023.html|title=Local Government Act 2001, Section 23|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=3 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===In Northern Ireland===\n{{main|Counties of Northern Ireland|Local government in Northern Ireland}}\n\nIn Northern Ireland, a major reorganisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two [[county borough]]s ([[Belfast]] and [[Derry]]<ref name=\"LDerry\" group=\"nb\">Londonderry is often called ''Derry''. See [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]].</ref>) with 26 single-tier districts for local government purposes. In 2015, as a result of a [[Reform of local government in Northern Ireland|reform process that started in 2005]], these districts were merged to form 11 new single-tier \"super districts\".\n\nThe six traditional counties remain in use for some purposes, including the three-letter coding of [[British car number plates#Northern Ireland|vehicle number plates]], the [[Royal Mail]] [[Postcode Address File]] (which records counties in all addresses although they are no longer required for postcoded mail) and [[Lord Lieutenant#Northern Ireland|Lord Lieutenancies]] (for which the former county boroughs are also used). There are no longer official 'county towns'. However the counties are still very widely acknowledged, for example as administrative divisions for sporting and cultural organisations.\n\n===Other uses===\nThe administrative division of the island along the lines of the traditional 32 counties was also adopted by non-governmental and cultural organisations. In particular the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] continues to organise its activities on the basis of [[GAA county|GAA counties]] that, throughout the island, correspond almost exactly to the 32 traditional counties in use at the time of the foundation of that organisation in 1884. The GAA also uses the term \"county\" for some of its organisational units in Britain and further afield.\n\n==List of counties==\nThe 35 divisions listed below include the \"traditional\" counties of Ireland as well as those created or re-created after the 19th century. Twenty four counties still delimit the remit of local government divisions in the Republic of Ireland (in some cases with slightly redrawn boundaries). In Northern Ireland, the counties listed no longer serve this purpose. The Irish-language names of counties in the Republic of Ireland are prescribed by ministerial order, which in the case of three newer counties, omits the word ''contae'' (county).<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/ga/si/0519.html Ministerial Order, 2003] setting out Irish-language names</ref> Irish names form the basis for all English-language county names except Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow, which are of Norse origin.\n\nIn the \"Region\" column of the table below, except for the six Northern Ireland counties the reference is to [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland]]. \"[[County town]]\" is the current or former administrative capital of the county.\n\nCities which, in the Republic, are currently administered outside the county system, but with the same legal status as administrative counties, are not shown separately: these are [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Dublin]] and, [[Galway]]. Also omitted are the former [[county borough]]s of Londonderry and [[Belfast]] which in Northern Ireland had the same legal status as the six counties until the reorganisation of local government in 1973. [[County Dublin]], which was officially abolished in 1994, is included, as are the three new administrative counties which took over the functions of the defunct [[Dublin County Council]].\n\n{|

These specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a [[computer]] does not necessarily mean a home desktop. A computer is any device with a [[Central processing unit|processor]] and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the [[technology]] within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.\n\nThe field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years. It offers many areas for specialization, including securing networks and allied [[infrastructure]], securing [[Application software|applications]] and [[database]]s, [[security testing]], information systems [[Information technology audit|auditing]], [[business continuity planning]], electronic record discovery, and [[digital forensics]]. Information security professionals are very stable in their employment. {{As of|2013}} more than 80 percent of professionals had no change in employer or employment over a period of a year, and the number of professionals is projected to continuously grow more than 11 percent annually from 2014 to 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Information Security Qualifications Fact Sheet|url=http://www.itgovernance.co.uk/download/Information-security-qualifications.pdf|website=IT Governance|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Threats ===\n\nInformation security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. [[Computer virus|Viruses]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=CISSP Study Guide|last=Stewart|first=James|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-31417-3|location=Canada|pages=255\u2013257}}</ref> [[Computer worm|worms]], [[Phishing|phishing attacks]], and [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] are a few common examples of software attacks. The [[Intellectual property infringement|theft of intellectual property]] has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. [[Identity theft]] is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile,<ref>{{cite web|last=Enge|first=Eric|url=https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-mobile-grows-but-desktop-still-a-big-player/|title=Stone Temple}} [[Mobile phone|Cell phones]]</ref> are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. [[Sabotage]] usually consists of the destruction of an organization's [[website]] in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company's property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with [[ransomware]]. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.\n\n[[Governments]], [[military]], [[corporation]]s, [[financial institution]]s, [[hospital]]s and private [[businesses]] amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products, research and financial status. Should confidential information about a business' customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or a [[black hat hacker]], a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation. From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Lawrence|last2=Loeb|first2=Martin|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438\u2013457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>\n\nFor the individual, information security has a significant effect on [[privacy]], which is viewed very differently in various [[cultures]].\n\n==== Responses to threats ====\nPossible responses to a security threat or [[IT risk management|risk]] are:<ref>{{Cite book|title=CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Study Guide Sixth Edition|last=Stewart|first=James|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-31417-3|location=Canada|pages=255\u2013257}}</ref>\n* reduce/mitigate \u2013 implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats\n* assign/transfer \u2013 place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing\n* accept \u2013 evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threat\n\n== History ==\n\nSince the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting [[Tamper-evident|tampering]]. [[Julius Caesar]] is credited with the invention of the [[Caesar cipher]] c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands; however, for the most part protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gaius|last1=Suetonius Tranquillus|title=Lives of the Caesars (Oxford World's Classics)|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-953756-3|page=28|authorlink=Suetonius}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Code Book]] |last=Singh |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Singh |year=2000 |publisher=Anchor |isbn=0-385-49532-3 |pages=289\u2013290 }}</ref> Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g., the U.K.'s Secret Office, founded in 1653<ref name=\"JohnsonTheEvo97\">{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnson |title=The Evolution of British Sigint: 1653\u20131939 |year=1997 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |asin=B00GYX1GX2}}</ref>).\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century more complex [[Classified information|classification systems]] were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity. For example, the British Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the [[Official Secrets Act 1889|Official Secrets Act]] in 1889.<ref name=\"HastedtSpies11\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8WoNp2vI-cC&pg=PA589 |chapter=Official Secrets Act (1889; New 1911; Amended 1920, 1939, 1989) |title=Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: An Encyclopedia of American Espionage |volume=2 |author=Ruppert, K. |editor=Hastedt, G.P. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |pages=589\u2013590 |isbn=9781851098088}}</ref> By the time of the [[First World War]], multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the [[Second World War]] necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than men) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed. The [[Enigma Machine]], which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and was successfully decrypted by [[Alan Turing]], can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information.<ref name=\"Sebag-MontefioreEnigma11\">{{cite book |title=Enigma: The Battle for the Code |author=Sebag\u2013Montefiore, H. |publisher=Orion |pages=576 |year=2011 |isbn=9781780221236}}</ref> Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly, and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g., the capture of [[U-570]]<ref name=\"Sebag-MontefioreEnigma11\" />).\n\nThe end of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty-first century saw rapid advancements in [[telecommunications]], computing [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], and data [[encryption]]. The availability of smaller, more powerful and less expensive computing equipment made [[Data processing|electronic data processing]] within the reach of [[small business]] and the home user. These computers quickly became interconnected through the [[internet]].\n\nThe rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data processing and [[electronic business]] conducted through the internet, along with numerous occurrences of international [[terrorism]], fueled the need for better methods of protecting the computers and the information they store, process and transmit.<ref name=\"DeLeeuwTheHist07\">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 24: A History of Internet Security |title=The History of Information Security: A Comprehensive Handbook |author=DeNardis, L. |editor1=de Leeuw, K.M.M.|editor2=Bergstra, J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=681\u2013704 |year=2007 |isbn=9780080550589}}</ref> The academic disciplines of [[computer security]] and [[information assurance]] emerged along with numerous professional organizations, all sharing the common goals of ensuring the security and reliability of information systems.\n\n== Definitions ==\n[[File:CIAJMK1209.png|thumb|'''Information Security Attributes''': or qualities, i.e., [[Confidentiality]], [[Data integrity|Integrity]] and [[Availability]] (CIA).

The merits of the [[Parkerian Hexad]] are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slade|first=Rob|url=http://blog.isc2.org/isc2_blog/2008/12/cia-triad-versus-parkerian-hexad.html|title=(ICS)2 Blog}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[The Open Group]] published the information security management standard [[Open Information Security Maturity Model|O-ISM3]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Aceituno|first=Vicente|title=Open Information Security Maturity Model|url=http://www.ism3.com/node/39|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref> This standard proposed an [[operational definition]] of the key concepts of security, with elements called \"security objectives\", related to [[access control]] (9), [[availability]] (3), [[data quality]] (1), [[standards-compliant|compliance]] and technical (4). In 2009, [[DoD]] [https://spi.dod.mil/ Software Protection Initiative] released the [https://spi.dod.mil/threat.htm Three Tenets of Cybersecurity] which are System Susceptibility, Access to the Flaw, and Capability to Exploit the Flaw.<ref>http://www.dartmouth.edu/~gvc/ThreeTenetsSPIE.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.timreview.ca/article/712|title=Quantitative Metrics and Risk Assessment: The Three Tenets Model of Cybersecurity|first1=Jeff|last1=Hughes|first2=George|last2=Cybenko|date=21 June 2018|journal=Technology Innovation Management Review|volume=3|issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.continuum.net/blog/are-your-clients-falling-for-these-it-security-myths-chart|title=Are Your Clients Falling for These IT Security Myths? [CHART]|first=Lily|last=Teplow|website=continuum.net}}</ref> Neither of these models are widely adopted.\n\n==== Confidentiality ====\nIn information security, confidentiality \"is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\"<ref name=\"BeckersPattern15\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvdICAAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 |title=Pattern and Security Requirements: Engineering-Based Establishment of Security Standards |author=Beckers, K. |publisher=Springer |page=100 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319166643}}</ref> While similar to \"privacy,\" the two words aren't interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.<ref name=\"AndressTheBasics14\" />\n\n==== Integrity ====\nIn information security, [[data integrity]] means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boritz|first=J. Efrim|title=IS Practitioners' Views on Core Concepts of Information Integrity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089505000473|work=International Journal of Accounting Information Systems|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=12 August 2011|doi=10.1016/j.accinf.2005.07.001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=260\u2013279}}</ref>  This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as [[referential integrity]] in [[databases]], although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic [[ACID]] model of [[transaction processing]]. Information security systems typically provide message integrity in addition to data confidentiality.\n\n==== Availability ====\nFor any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be [[availability|available]] when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the [[security controls]] used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. [[High availability]] systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing [[denial-of-service attack]]s, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Loukas | first1 = G. | last2 = Oke | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/bxp078 | title = Protection Against Denial of Service Attacks: A Survey | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the CIA triad to be provided effectively.\n\n[[File:CIAJMK1209.png|thumb|CIA triad methodology]]\n\n==== Non-repudiation ====\nIn law, [[non-repudiation]] implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.<ref name=\"BidgoliHandbook06\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RfANAwOUdIC&pg=PA65 |chapter=Digital Libraries: Security and Preservation Considerations |title=Handbook of Information Security, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Prevention, Detection, and Management |author=McCarthy, C. |editor=Bidgoli, H. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |volume=3 |pages=49\u201376 |year=2006 |isbn=9780470051214}}</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit ([[data integrity]]). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).\n\n== Risk management ==\n{{Main|Risk management}}\n\nThe ''[[Certified Information Systems Auditor]] (CISA) Review Manual 2006'' provides the following definition of risk management: \"Risk management is the process of identifying [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and [[threat (computer)|threats]] to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what [[Countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]], if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=CISA Review Manual 2006|last=ISACA|first=|publisher=Information Systems Audit and Control Association|year=2006|isbn=1-933284-15-3|location=|page=85|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThere are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the ''process'' of risk management is an ongoing, iterative [[Business process|process]]. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new [[threat (computer)|threats]] and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] emerge every day. Second, the choice of [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] ([[security controls|controls]]) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.\n\nRisk analysis and risk evaluation processes have their limitations since, when security incidents occur, they emerge in a context, and their rarity and uniqueness give rise to unpredictable threats. The analysis of these phenomena, which are characterized by breakdowns, surprises and side-effects, requires a theoretical approach that is able to examine and interpret subjectively the detail of each incident.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spagnoletti|first=Paolo|author2=Resca A.|title=The duality of Information Security Management: fighting against predictable and unpredictable threats|journal=Journal of Information System Security|year=2008|volume=4|issue=3|pages=46\u201362|url=http://eprints.luiss.it/955/}}</ref>\n\nRisk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset). A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or [[natural disaster|act of nature]]) that has the potential to cause harm.\n\nThe likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property).<ref name=\"GramaLegal14\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqoyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT38 |title=Legal Issues in Information Security |author=Grama, J.L. |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |pages=550 |year=2014 |isbn=9781284151046}}</ref> It should be pointed out that it is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called \"residual risk.\"\n\nA [[risk assessment]] is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business. Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed. The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use [[Statistics|quantitative]] analysis.\n\nResearch has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kiountouzis| first1=E.A.|last2=Kokolakis|first2=S.A.|title=Information systems security: facing the information society of the 21st century|publisher=Chapman & Hall, Ltd.|location= London|isbn=0-412-78120-4}}</ref> The [[ISO/IEC 17799|ISO/IEC 27002:2005]] Code of practice for [[information security management]] recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:\n* [[security policy]],\n* [[organization]] of information security,\n* [[asset management]],\n* [[human resources]] security,\n* physical and [[environmental security]],\n* [[communications]] and operations management,\n* [[access control]],\n* information systems acquisition, development and maintenance,\n* information security [[incident management]],\n* business continuity management, and\n* regulatory compliance.\n\nIn broad terms, the risk management process consists of:<ref name=\"NewsomeAPract13\">{{cite book |title=A Practical Introduction to Security and Risk Management |author=Newsome, B. |publisher=SAGE Publications |pages=208 |year=2013 |isbn=9781483324852}}</ref><ref name=\"WhitmanManage16\">{{cite book |title=Management of Information Security |author1=Whitman, M.E.|author2=Mattord, H.J. |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=5th |pages=592 |year=2016 |isbn=9781305501256}}</ref>\n# Identification of assets and estimating their value.

Or, leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business.<ref name=SP80030>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf |title=NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk.\n\n=== Security controls ===\n{{Main|security controls}}\nSelecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. [[ISO/IEC 27001]] has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization.<ref name=\"JohnsonSecurity15\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7SYBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |title=Security Controls Evaluation, Testing, and Assessment Handbook |author=Johnson, L. |publisher=Syngress |pages=678 |year=2015 |isbn=9780128025642}}</ref> [[ISO/IEC 27002]] offers a guideline for organizational information security standards.\n\n==== Administrative ====\nAdministrative controls consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed \u2013 the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|Payment Card Industry Data Sec]]<ref name=\":0\" />[[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|urity Sta]][[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|ndard]] (PCI DSS) required by [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, [[password policy]], hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.\n\nAdministrative controls form the basis for the selection and implementation of logical and physical controls. Logical and physical controls are manifestations of administrative controls, which are of paramount importance.\n\n==== Logical ====\nLogical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and computing systems. Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network [[intrusion detection]] systems, [[access control list]]s, and data encryption are examples of logical controls.\n\nAn important logical control that is frequently overlooked is the principle of least privilege, which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task.<ref name=\"RansomeCore13\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MX5cAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA40 |title=Core Software Security: Security at the Source |author1=Ransome, J.|author2=Misra, A. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=40\u201341 |year=2013 |isbn=9781466560956}}</ref> A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, employees are promoted to a new position, or employees are transferred to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges, which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.\n\n==== Physical ====\nPhysical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, cable locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.\n\nAn important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the [[System administrator|server administrator]] or the [[database administrator]]; these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isaca.org/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=CISA1&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=40835 |title=Segregation of Duties Control matrix |year=2008 |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703162553/http://www.isaca.org/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=CISA1&Template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=40835 |archivedate=3 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Defense in depth<!--Section linked from [[Onion model]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--> ===\n[[File:Defense In Depth - Onion Model.svg|thumb|right|The [[onion model]] of defense in depth]]\n{{Main|Defense in depth (computing)}}\nInformation security must protect information throughout its lifespan, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information.  The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on and overlapping of security measures is called \"defense in depth.\" In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.<ref name=\"VaccaComputer13\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb916YOr16wC&pg=PA546 |chapter=Chapter 31: What is Vulnerability Assessment? |title=Computer and Information Security Handbook |author=Kakareka, A. |editor=Vacca, J.R. |publisher=Elsevier |edition=2nd |pages=541\u2013552 |year=2013 |isbn=9780123946126}}</ref>\n\nRecall the earlier discussion about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy. With this approach, defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other. Additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and [[network security]], host-based security and [[application security]] forming the outermost layers of the onion. Both perspectives are equally valid, and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy.\n\n=== Security classification for information ===\nAn important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a [[Classified information|security classification]]. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required [[security controls]] for each classification.<ref name=\"BayukEnterprise09\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxPhvm1EP3EC&pg=PA59 |chapter=Chapter 4: Information Classification |title=Enterprise Information Security and Privacy |author=Bayuk, J. |editor1=Axelrod, C.W.|editor2=Bayuk, J.L.|editor3=Schutzer, D. |publisher=Artech House |year=2009 |pages=59\u201370 |isbn=9781596931916}}</ref>\n\nSome factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The [[ISACA|Information Systems Audit and Control Association]] (ISACA) and its ''Business Model for Information Security'' also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.<ref name=\"ISACA-BMIS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.isaca.org/KNOWLEDGE-CENTER/BMIS/Pages/Business-Model-for-Information-Security.aspx |title=Business Model for Information Security (BMIS) |publisher=ISACA |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:<ref name=\"BayukEnterprise09\" />\n* In the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.\n* In the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret and their non-English equivalents.\n* In cross-sectoral formations, the [[Traffic Light Protocol]], which consists of: White, Green, Amber, and Red.\n\nAll employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.\n\n=== Access control ===\nAccess to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and [[authentication]].\n\nAccess control is generally considered in three steps: identification, [[authentication]], and [[authorization]].<ref name=\"AndressTheBasics14\" />\n\n==== Identification ====\nIdentification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement \"Hello, my name is [[John Doe]]\" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming \"I am the person the username belongs to\".\n\n==== Authentication ====\nAuthentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the [[bank teller]] he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his [[driver's license]]. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.\n\nThere are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:\n* Something you know: things such as a PIN, a [[password]], or your mother's [[maiden name]]\n* Something you have: a driver's license or a magnetic [[swipe card]]\n* Something you are: [[biometrics]], including [[palm print]]s, [[fingerprint]]s, [[Speaker recognition|voice prints]] and [[Retina scan|retina (eye) scans]]\n\nStrong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The [[username]] is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Akpeninor|first1=James Ohwofasa|title=Modern Concepts of Security|date=2013|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4817-8232-6|page=135|url=https://books.google.ca/books?isbn=1481782320|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref> Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as [[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm|Time-based One-time Password algorithm]]s.\n\n==== Authorization ====\nAfter a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called [[authorization]]. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.<ref name=\"AndressTheBasics14\" />\n\nThe non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.\n\nExamples of common access control mechanisms in use today include [[Role-Based Access Control|role-based access control]], available in many advanced database management systems; simple [[File system permissions|file permissions]] provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; [[Group Policy Object]]s provided in Windows network systems; and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[RADIUS]], [[TACACS]], and the simple access lists used in many [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and [[Router (computing)|routers]].\n\nTo be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]'s guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of [[audit trail]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2004reports/200420131fr.html|title=The Use of Audit Trails to Monitor Key Networks and Systems Should Remain Part of the Computer Security Material Weakness|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref>\n\nAlso, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a [[Classified information|top-secret clearance]], they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privileges to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.\n\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Cryptography}}\nInformation security uses [[cryptography]] to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called [[encryption]]. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]], through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the [[information]] is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.<ref name=\"AndressTheBasics14\" />\n\nCryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, [[non-repudiation]], and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as [[Telnet]] and [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA/WPA2]] or the older (and less secure) [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]]. Wired communications (such as [[ITU-T|ITU\u2011T]] [[G.hn]]) are secured using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] for encryption and [[X.1035]] for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as [[GnuPG]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] can be used to encrypt data files and email.\n\nCryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The [[Key size|length and strength]] of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is [[Weak key|weak]] or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround [[key management]].<ref name=\"AndressTheBasics14\" />\n\n== Process ==\nThe terms \"reasonable and prudent person,\" \"[[due care]]\" and \"due diligence\" have been used in the fields of finance, securities, and law for many years. In recent years these terms have found their way into the fields of computing and information security.<ref name=\"WhitmanManage16\" /> U.S. [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.<ref name=\"VallabhaneniCorporate08\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvYbQr9MV_sC&pg=PA288 |title=Corporate Management, Governance, and Ethics Best Practices |author=Vallabhaneni, S.R. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=288 |year=2008 |isbn=9780470255803}}</ref>\n\nIn the business world, stockholders, customers, business partners and governments have the expectation that corporate officers will run the business in accordance with accepted business practices and in compliance with laws and other regulatory requirements. This is often described as the \"reasonable and prudent person\" rule. A prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal ethical manner. A prudent person is also diligent (mindful, attentive, and ongoing) in their due care of the business.\n\nIn the field of information security, Harris<ref>{{cite book|author=Shon Harris|authorlink=Shon Harris|title=All-in-one CISSP Certification Exam Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]/Osborne|year=2003|location=[[Emeryville, California]]|isbn=0-07-222966-7}}</ref>\noffers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:\n\n<blockquote>''\"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees.\"'' And, <nowiki>[Due diligence are the]</nowiki> ''\"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational.\"''\n</blockquote>\n\nAttention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.\n\nOrganizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security.

This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.<ref name=\"CampbellPractical16\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbWiDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA218 |chapter=Chapter 14: Secure Systems Development |title=Practical Information Security Management: A Complete Guide to Planning and Implementation |author=Campbell, T. |publisher=Apress |year=2016 |page=218 |isbn=9781484216859}}</ref>\n\nAny change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management's many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.\n\nNot every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.\n\nChange management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization's documented change management procedures are followed. The change management process is as follows<ref name=\"TaylorProject08\">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 10: Understanding the Project Change Process |title=Project Scheduling and Cost Control: Planning, Monitoring and Controlling the Baseline |author=Taylor, J. |publisher=J. Ross Publishing |year=2008 |pages=187\u2013214 |isbn=9781932159110}}</ref>\n\n* '''Request:'''  Anyone can request a change. The person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change. When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations [[business model]] and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change.\n* '''Approve:''' Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore, management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change. Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model, industry standards or best practices. Management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change.\n* '''Plan:''' Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing, testing and documenting both implementation and back-out plans. Need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.\n* '''Test:''' Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production environment. The backout plan must also be tested.\n* '''Schedule:''' Part of the change review board's responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities.\n* '''Communicate:'''  Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated. The communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change. The communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur. Another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.\n* '''Implement:'''  At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented.  Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a back out plan. If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post implementation testing fails or, other \"drop dead\" criteria have been met, the back out plan should be implemented.\n* '''Document:'''  All changes must be documented. The documentation includes the initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the change was implemented, who implemented it, and whether the change was implemented successfully, failed or postponed.\n* '''Post-change review:'''  The change review board should hold a post-implementation review of changes. It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for areas for improvement.\n\nChange management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment.  Good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented. This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation and communication.\n\n[[ISO/IEC 20000]], The Visible OPS Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps<ref>[http://www.itpi.org/home/visibleops2.php itpi.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210081531/http://www.itpi.org/home/visibleops2.php |date=December 10, 2013 }}</ref> (Full book summary),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Visible_Ops |title=book summary of The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps |publisher=wikisummaries.org |accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> and [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] all provide valuable guidance on implementing an efficient and effective change management program information security.\n\n== Business continuity ==\n\nBusiness continuity management ([[Business continuity planning|BCM]]) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization's critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects. BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the continuation of business as usual. The BCM should be included in an organizations [[risk analysis]] plan to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of any type of threat to any business function.<ref>Hotchkiss, Stuart. Business Continuity Management : In Practice, British Informatics Society Limited, 2010.

A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) infrastructure. Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group, performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing the plan.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Disaster Recovery Plan|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/recovery/disaster-recovery-plan_1164|publisher=Sans Institute|accessdate=7 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Laws and regulations ==\n[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking<br />green: Protections and safeguards<br />red: Endemic surveillance societies]]\n\nBelow is a partial listing of governmental laws and regulations in various parts of the world that have, had, or will have, a significant effect on data processing and information security.

[[Gapminder Foundation]].</ref> [[globalisation]] and favorable political circumstances such as [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]] and [[peace]]. Increase in income also tends to lead to people choosing to work less [[working hours|hours]].\n[[Developed countries]] (defined as countries with a \"developed economy\") have higher incomes as opposed to [[developing countries]] tending to have lower incomes.\n\n==Economic definitions==\nIn [[economics]], \"[[factor income]]\" is the return accruing for a person, or a nation, derived from the \"factors of production\": rental income, wages generated by labor, the interest created by capital, and profits from entrepreneurial ventures.<ref>{{cite web|title=factor income|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/factor-income.html|work=BusinessDictionary.com|publisher=WebFinance, Inc|accessdate=20 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom labor services, as well as ownership of [[Land (economics)|land]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn [[consumer theory]] 'income' is another name for the \"budget constraint,\" an amount <math>Y</math> to be spent on different goods x and y in quantities <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> at prices <math>P_x</math> and <math>P_y</math>.  The basic equation for this is\n:<math>Y=P_x \\cdot x + P_y \\cdot y</math>\nThis equation implies two things. First buying one more unit of good x implies buying <math>\\frac{P_x}{P_y}</math> less units of good y.  So, <math>\\frac{P_x}{P_y}</math> is the ''relative'' price of a unit of x as to the number of units given up in y.  Second, if the price of x falls for a fixed <math>Y</math>, then its relative price falls.  The usual hypothesis is that the quantity demanded of x would increase at the lower price, the [[law of demand]].  The generalization to more than two goods consists of modelling y as a [[composite good]].\n\nThe theoretical generalization to more than one period is a multi-period [[wealth (economics)|wealth]] and income constraint. For example, the same person can gain more productive skills or acquire more productive income-earning assets to earn a higher income. In the multi-period case, something might also happen to the economy beyond the control of the individual to reduce (or increase) the flow of income. Changing measured income and its relation to consumption over time might be modeled accordingly, such as in the [[permanent income hypothesis]].\n\n===Full and Haig-Simons income===\n{{main article|Haig-Simons income}}\n\"Full income\" refers to the accumulation of both the monetary and the non-monetary consumption-ability of any given entity, such as a person or a household. According to what the economist [[Nicholas Barr]] describes as the \"classical definition of income\" (the 1938 Haig-Simons definition): \"income may be defined as the... sum of (1) the market value of rights exercised in consumption and (2) the change in the value of the store of property rights...\" Since the consumption potential of non-monetary goods, such as leisure, cannot be measured, monetary income may be thought of as a proxy for full income.<ref name=\"Barr\"/> As such, however, it is criticized{{by whom|date=July 2015}} for being unreliable, ''i.e.'' failing to accurately reflect affluence (and thus the consumption opportunities) of any given agent. It omits the utility a person may derive from non-monetary income and, on a macroeconomic level, fails to accurately chart [[Social welfare (disambiguation)|social welfare]]. According to Barr, \"in practice money income as a proportion of total income varies widely and unsystematically. Non-observability of full-income prevent a complete characterization of the individual opportunity set, forcing us to use the unreliable yardstick of money income.\n\n== Income inequality ==\n[[Income inequality]] refers to the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner. It can be measured by various methods, including the [[Lorenz curve]] and the [[Gini coefficient]]. Economists generally agree that certain amounts of inequality are necessary and desirable but that excessive inequality leads to efficiency problems and social injustice.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\nNational income, measured by statistics such as the [[Net National Income]] (NNI), measures the total income of individuals, corporations, and government in the economy.  For more information see [[measures of national income and output]].\n\n== Income in philosophy and ethics ==\nThroughout history, many have written about the impact of income on [[morality]] and [[society]]. [[Saint Paul]] wrote 'For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil:' ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#6:10|1 Timothy 6:10]] ([[American Standard Version|ASV]])).\n\nSome scholars have come to the conclusion that material progress and prosperity, as manifested in continuous income growth at both the individual and the national level, provide the indispensable foundation for sustaining any kind of morality. This argument was explicitly given by [[Adam Smith]] in his ''Theory of Moral Sentiments''{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, and has more recently been developed by Harvard economist [[Benjamin M. Friedman|Benjamin Friedman]] in his book ''The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Accountancy==\nThe [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) uses the following definition: \"Income is increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.\" [F.70] (IFRS Framework).\n\nAccording to [[John Hicks#Contributions to interpretation of income for accounting purposes|John Hicks' definitions]], income \"is the maximum amount which can be spent during a period if there is to be an expectation of maintaining intact, the capital value of prospective receipts (in money terms)\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxbridge Notes|url=https://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk/revision_notes/accounting-lse-financial-accounting-analysis-and-valuation/samples/5-hicks-income|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nJohn Hicks used \"I\" for income, but [[Keynes]] wrote to him in 1937, \"''after trying both, I believe it is easier to use Y for income and I for investment.''\" Some consider Y as an alternative letter for the phonem I in languages like Spanish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2016/12/why-y.html|title=Why Y?|date=December 21, 2016|website=Greg Mankiw's Blog}}</ref> although Y as the \"[[Y#Name|Greek I]]\" was actually pronounced like the modern German \u00fc or the phonetic /y/.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|income}}\n*[[Basic income]]\n*[[Comprehensive income]]\n*[[Income tax]]\n*[[Unpaid workers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*D.

It is mainly known for [[Iona Abbey]], though there are other buildings on the island. [[Iona Abbey]] was a centre of [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Gaelic monasticism]] for three centuries<ref name=Smith/> and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment.<ref>Murray (1966) p 81</ref> It is a tourist destination and a place for [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreats]]. Its modern [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name means \"Iona of (Saint) [[Columba]]\" (formerly anglicised \"Icolmkill\").\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Hebrides]] have been occupied by the speakers of several languages since the [[Iron Age]], and as a result many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning.<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. xiii</ref> Nonetheless few, if any, can have accumulated so many different names over the centuries as the island now known in English as \"Iona\".\n\nThe earliest forms of the name enabled place-name scholar [[William J. Watson]] to show that the name originally meant something like \"yew-place\".<ref>Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 87&ndash;90</ref>  The element ''Ivo-'', denoting \"[[Taxus baccata|yew]]\", occurs in [[Ogham]] inscriptions (''Iva-cattos'' [genitive], ''Iva-geni'' [genitive]) and in Gaulish names (''Ivo-rix'', ''Ivo-magus'') and may form the basis of early Gaelic names like ''Eogan'' (ogham: ''Ivo-genos'').<ref>Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 87&ndash;88.</ref><ref group=\"fn\">The name of the Gaulish god ''Ivavos'' is of similar origin, associated with the healing-well of [[\u00c9vaux-les-Bains|Evaux]] in France.</ref> It is possible that the name is related to the mythological figure, ''Fer h\u00cd mac Eogabail'', foster-son of [[Manannan]], the forename meaning \"man of the yew\".<ref>Watson, ''Celtic Place-Names'', pp. 88&ndash;89</ref>\n\nMac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) lists the more recent Gaelic names of ''\u00cc'',<ref group=\"fn\">For etymology of \u00cc and Latinised derivative ''Iona'', see Watson (2004), pp. 87&ndash;90.</ref> ''\u00cc Chaluim Chille'' and ''Eilean Idhe'' noting that the first named is \"generally lengthened to avoid confusion\" to the second, which means \"Calum's (i.e. in latinised form \"Columba's\") Iona\" or \"island of Calum's monastery\".<ref name=Mac>Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) p. 67.</ref><ref name=H-Smith>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 80.</ref> The possible confusion results from \"\u00ec\", despite its original etymology, becoming a Gaelic noun (now obsolete) meaning simply \"island\".<ref>Dwelly (1911)</ref> ''Eilean Idhe'' means \"the isle of Iona\", also known as ''\u00cc nam ban b\u00f2idheach'' (\"the isle of beautiful women\").

[[William Reeves (bishop)|William Reeves]] (1857) University Press for the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society. pp. 248-50.</ref> Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. The monastery was hugely successful, and played a crucial role in the conversion to Christianity of the [[Picts]] of present-day [[Scotland]] in the late 6th century and of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]] in 635. Many satellite institutions were founded, and Iona became the centre of one of the most important [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|monastic systems]] in Great Britain and Ireland.<ref name=Koch>Koch, pp. 657\u2013658.</ref>\n\nIona became a renowned centre of learning, and its [[scriptorium]] produced highly important documents, probably including the original texts of the Iona Chronicle, thought to be the source for the early [[Irish annals]].<ref name=Koch/> The monastery is often associated with the distinctive practices and traditions known as [[Celtic Christianity]]. In particular, Iona was a major supporter of the \"Celtic\" system for [[Celtic Christianity#Easter calculation|calculating the date of Easter]] at the time of the [[Easter controversy]], which pitted supporters of the Celtic system against those favoring the \"Roman\" system used elsewhere in Western Christianity. The controversy weakened Iona's ties to Northumbria, which adopted the Roman system at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664, and to Pictland, which followed suit in the early 8th century. Iona itself did not adopt the Roman system until 715, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian [[Bede]]. Iona's prominence was further diminished over the next centuries as a result of [[Viking]] raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the [[Abbey of Kells]].<ref name=Koch/>\n\nThe [[Book of Kells]] may have been produced or begun on Iona towards the end of the 8th century.<ref name=Koch/><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012). ''Pages from the Book of Kells''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00AN4JVI0</ref> Around this time the island's exemplary [[high cross]]es were sculpted; these may be the first such crosses to contain the ring around the intersection that became characteristic of the \"[[Celtic cross]]\".<ref name=Koch/> The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba's relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/earlychurch/trails_earlychurch_iona2.shtml BBC - Iona - A Beacon of Light Through the Dark Ages]</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of the Isles===\nAs the Norse domination of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. The Norse  ''Rex plurimarum insularum'' [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]] died in 980 or 981 whilst in \"religious retirement\" on Iona.<ref name=OC11>\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1998) p. 11</ref><ref>Gregory (1881) pp. 4\u20136</ref> Nonetheless the island was sacked twice by his successors, on Christmas night 986 and again in 987.<ref>Woolf (2007) pp. 217\u201318</ref> Although Iona was never again important to Ireland, it rose to prominence once more in Scotland following the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in the later 9th century; the ruling dynasty of Scotland traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important spiritual centre for the new kingdom, with many of its early kings buried there<ref name=Koch/>. However, a campaign by [[Magnus Barelegs]] led to the formal acknowledgement of Norwegian control of Argyll, in 1098.\n\n[[Somerled]], the brother-in-law of Norway's governor of the region (the ''King of the Isles''), launched a revolt, and made the kingdom independent. A [[convent]] for [[Benedictine]] nuns was established in about 1208, with [[Beth\u00f3c, Prioress of Iona|Beth\u00f3c]], Somerled's daughter, as first prioress. The present Benedictine [[abbey]], [[Iona Abbey]], was built in about 1203. \n\nOn Somerled's death, nominal Norwegian overlordship of the Kingdom was re-established, but de facto control was split between Somerled's sons, and his brother-in-law.\n\n===Kingdom of Scotland===\n\nFollowing the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]] the Hebrides were transferred from Norwegian to Scottish overlordship.<ref>Hunter (2000) pp. 110\u2013111</ref>. At the end of the century, king [[John Balliol]] was challenged for the throne by [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert de Bruys]] Robert The Bruce. By this point, Somerled's descendants had split into three groups, the [[Clann Ruaidhr\u00ed|MacRory]], [[Clan MacDougall|MacDougalls]], and [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]]. The MacDougalls backed Balliol, so when he was defeated by de Bruys, the latter exiled the MacDougalls and transferred their island territories to the MacDonalds; by marrying the [[Amy of Garmoran|heir of the MacRory]]s, [[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|the heir of the MacDonalds]] re-unified most of Somerled's realm, creating the [[Lordship of the Isles]], under nominal Scottish authority. Iona, which had been a MacDougall territory (together with the rest of Lorn), was given to the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]], where it remained for half a century.\n\nIn 1354, though in exile and without control of his ancestral lands, [[John Gallda MacDougall|John, the MacDougall heir]], quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull and Iona to the Lord of the Isles (though this had no meaningful effect at the time). When Robert's son, [[David II, King of Scotland]], became king, he spent some time in English captivity; following his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn. The 1354 quitclaim, which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in just such an eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull and Iona from Lorn, and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles. Iona remained part of the Lordship of the Isles for the next century and a half.\n\nFollowing the 1491 [[Raid on Ross]], the Lordship of the Isles was dismantled, and Scotland gained full control of Iona for the second time. The monastery and nunnery continued to be active until the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed.<ref>[http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/Isle_of_Iona Travel Scotland]</ref>. The Augustine nunnery now only survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and cloister. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a medieval nunnery in Scotland.\n\n===Post-Union===\n\nAfter a visit in 1773, the English writer [[Samuel Johnson]] remarked:\n\n:The island, which was once the metropolis of learning and piety, now has no school for education, nor temple for worship.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2064 ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland''], Project Gutenberg.</ref>\n\nHe estimated the population of the village at 70 families or perhaps 350 inhabitants.\n\nIn the 19th century green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive.<ref>Industrial Archaeology review, Vol I Number 1 Autumn 1976 ''The Marble Quarry, Iona, Inner Hebrides'', D.

Panorama.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Panoramic view]]\n[[File:Iona.showing.monasteries.jpg|thumb|Enlargement, showing the location of the abbey and monasteries.]]\nIona Abbey, now an [[ecumenical]] church, is of particular historical and religious interest to pilgrims and visitors alike. It is the most elaborate and best-preserved ecclesiastical building surviving from the Middle Ages in the [[Western Isles]] of [[Scotland]].  Though modest in scale in comparison to medieval abbeys elsewhere in [[Western Europe]], it has a wealth of fine architectural detail, and monuments of many periods. The [[8th Duke of Argyll]] presented the sacred buildings and sites of the island to the Iona Cathedral trust in 1899.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nIn front of the Abbey stands the 9th century St Martin's Cross, one of the best-preserved Celtic crosses in the [[British Isles]], and a replica of the 8th century St John's Cross (original fragments in the Abbey museum).\n\nThe ancient burial ground, called the R\u00e8ilig Odhrain (Eng: Oran's \"burial place\" or \"cemetery\"), contains the 12th century chapel of [[Saint Otteran|St Odhr\u00e1n]] (said to be [[Columba]]'s uncle), restored at the same time as the Abbey itself. It contains a number of medieval grave monuments. The abbey graveyard contains the graves of many early [[Scotland/Monarchs|Scottish Kings]], as well as Norse kings from Ireland and Norway. Iona became the burial site for the kings of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and their successors. Notable burials there include:\n*[[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]], king of the Picts (also known today as \"Kenneth I of Scotland\")\n*[[Domnall mac Causant\u00edn]], alternatively \"king of the Picts\" or \"king of Scotland\"\n*[[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill]], king of Scotland (\"Malcolm I\")\n*[[Donnchad mac Cr\u00edn\u00e1in]], king of Scotland (\"Duncan I\")\n*[[Mac Bethad mac Findla\u00edch]], king of Scotland (\"Macbeth\")\n*[[Domnall mac Donnchada]], king of Scotland (\"Domnall B\u00e1n\" or \"Donald III\")\n*[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], Labour Party Leader\n\nIn 1549 an inventory of 48 Scottish, 8 Norwegian and 4 Irish kings was recorded. None of these graves are now identifiable (their inscriptions were reported to have worn away at the end of the 17th century). Saint [[Baithin]] and Saint [[F\u00e1ilbe mac P\u00edp\u00e1in|Failbhe]] may also be buried on the island. The Abbey graveyard is also the final resting place of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], the former Labour Party leader, who loved Iona. His grave is marked with an epitaph quoting [[Alexander Pope]]: \"An honest man's the noblest work of God\".<ref name=rowe>[http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article625010.ece ''Walk Of The Month: The island of Iona''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022054221/http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article625010.ece |date=22 October 2007 }} ''[[The Independent]]'' 4 June 2006</ref>\n\nOther early Christian and medieval monuments have been removed for preservation to the cloister arcade of the Abbey, and the Abbey museum (in the medieval infirmary).

This community is a leading force in the present [[Celtic Christian]] revival.\n\nThe Iona Community runs 3 residential centres on the Isle of Iona and on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], where one can live together in community with people of every background from all over the world. Weeks at the centres often follow a programme related to the concerns of the Iona Community.\n\nThe 8 tonne ''Fallen Christ'' sculpture by [[Ronald Rae]] was permanently situated outside the MacLeod Centre in February 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iona.org.uk/news.php?id=44 |title=The Fallen Christ on Iona |publisher=iona.org.uk |accessdate=8 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609065637/http://www.iona.org.uk/news.php?id=44 |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\nVisitors can reach Iona by the 10-minute ferry trip across the [[Sound of Iona]] from [[Fionnphort]] on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]. The most common route is via [[Oban]] in [[Argyll and Bute]]. Regular ferries connect to [[Craignure]] on Mull, from where the scenic road runs {{convert|37|mi|abbr=off}} to Fionnphort. Tourist coaches and local bus services meet the ferries.\n\nThere are very few cars on the island, as they are tightly regulated and vehicular access is not allowed for non-residents, who have to leave their car in Fionnphort.

As travel to north and west Scotland became easier from the mid C18 on, artists\u2019 visits to the island steadily increased. The Abbey remains in particular became frequently recorded during this early period. Many of the artists are listed and illustrated in the valuable book, ''\u2018Iona Portrayed \u2013 The Island through Artists\u2019 Eyes 1760-1960\u2019'', <ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian, Jessica & Stiller, Charles (2000), Iona Portrayed \u2013 The Island through Artists\u2019 Eyes 1760-1960,  The New Iona Press, Inverness, 96pp, numerous illustrations in B&W and colour, with list of artists.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> which lists over 170 artists known to have painted on the island.\n\nThe C20 however saw the greatest period of influence on landscape painting, in particular through the many paintings of the island produced by [[F C B Cadell]] and [[S J Peploe]], two of the \u2018[[Scottish Colourists]]\u2019. As with many artists, both professional and amateur, they were attracted by the unique quality of light, the white sandy beaches, the aquamarine colours of the sea and the landscape of rich greens and rocky outcrops. While Cadell and Peploe are perhaps best known, many major Scottish painters of the C20 worked on Iona and visited many times \u2013 for example [[George Houston (artist)|George Houston]], D Y Cameron, James Shearer, John Duncan and John Maclauchlan Milne, among many.\n\n==Media and the arts==\n[[Samuel Johnson]] wrote \"That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the [[Battle of Marathon|plains of Marathon]], or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona.\"<ref>Johnson (1775) p. 217</ref>\n\nIn [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Green Ray]]'', the heroes visit Iona in chapters 13 to 16. The inspiration is romantic, the ruins of the island are conducive to daydreaming. The young heroine, Helena Campbell, argues that Scotland in general and Iona in particular are the scene of the appearance of goblins and other familiar demons.\n\nIn [[Jean Raspail]]'s novel ''The Fisherman's Ring'' (1995), his cardinal is one of the last to support the antipope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] and his successors.\n\nIn the novel ''The Carved Stone'' (by Guillaume Pr\u00e9vost), the young Samuel Faulkner is projected in time as he searches for his father and lands on Iona in the year 800, then threatened by the Vikings.\n\n\"Peace of Iona\" is a song written by [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]] that appears on the studio album ''[[Universal Hall]]'' and on the live recording ''[[Karma to Burn (The Waterboys album)|Karma to Burn]]'' by [[The Waterboys]]. Iona is the setting for the song \"Oran\" on the 1997 [[Steve McDonald (Celtic music)|Steve McDonald]] album ''Stone of Destiny''.\n\nKenneth C. Steven published an anthology of poetry entitled ''Iona: Poems'' in 2000 inspired by his association with the island and the surrounding area.\n\nIona is featured prominently in the first episode (\"By the Skin of Our Teeth\") of the celebrated arts series ''[[Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark]]'' (1969).\n\nIona is the setting of Jeanne M. Dams' Dorothy Martin mystery ''Holy Terror of the Hebrides'' (1998).\n\nThe [[Academy Award]]\u2013nominated Irish animated film ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is about the creation of the [[Book of Kells]]. One of the characters, Brother Aiden, is a master [[Limner|illuminator]] from Iona Abbey who had helped to illustrate the Book, but had to escape the island with it during a Viking invasion.\n\nAfter his death in 2011, the cremated remains of songwriter/recording artist [[Gerry Rafferty]] were scattered on Iona.<ref name=\"Scotsman1\">{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Gerry-Rafferty-went-to-meet.6698811.jp?articlepage=2 |title='Gerry Rafferty went to meet his maker sober and unafraid, curious and brave' |publisher=thescotsman.scotsman.com |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Frances Macdonald]] the contemporary Scottish artist based in Crinian, Argyll, regularly paints landscapes on Iona.\n\n[[Iona Abbey]] is mentioned in [[Tori Amos]]'s \"Twinkle\" from her 1996 album ''[[Boys for Pele]]'':\n\"And last time I knew, she worked at an abbey in Iona.

Ido was specifically designed to be [[grammatically]], [[orthographically]], and [[lexicographically]] regular, and above all easy to learn and use. In this sense, Ido is classified as a constructed [[international auxiliary language]]. It is the most successful of many Esperanto derivatives, called [[Esperantido]]s.\n\nIdo was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in [[Esperanto]], a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication. The name of the language traces its origin to the Esperanto word ''{{wikteo|ido}}'', meaning \"offspring\",<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Esperanto-English Dictionary\n|url=http://esperanto-panorama.net/vortaro/eo-en-u.htm#I\n|accessdate=12 February 2012\n}}</ref> since the language is a \"descendant\" of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community, but following the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, [[Louis Couturat]], it declined in popularity. There were two reasons for this: first, the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects; and second, a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.\n\nIdo uses the same 26 letters as the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|English (Latin) alphabet]], with no [[diacritic]]s. It draws its vocabulary from English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese, and is largely intelligible to those who have studied Esperanto.\n\nSeveral works of literature have been translated into Ido, including ''[[The Little Prince]]'' and the [[Gospel of Luke]]. As of the year 2000, there were approximately 100\u2013200 Ido speakers in the world.<ref name=\"Blanke\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe idea of a universal second language is not new, and constructed languages are not a recent phenomenon. The first known constructed language was [[Lingua Ignota]], created in the 12th century. But the idea did not catch on in large numbers until the language [[Volap\u00fck]] was created in 1879. Volap\u00fck was popular for some time and apparently had a few thousand users, but was later eclipsed by the popularity of [[Esperanto]], which arose in 1887. Several other languages such as [[Latino sine Flexione]] and [[Idiom Neutral]] had also been put forward. It was during this time that French mathematician [[Louis Couturat]] formed the ''[[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]]''.\n\nThis delegation made a formal request to the [[International Association of Academies]] in [[Vienna]] to select and endorse an international language; the request was rejected in May 1907.<ref name=\"Gu\u00e9rard\">{{cite book\n|author=Gu\u00e9rard, A.

They concluded that no language was completely acceptable, but that Esperanto could be accepted \"on condition of several modifications to be realized by the permanent Commission in the direction defined by the conclusions of the Report of the Secretaries [Louis Couturat and [[L\u00e9opold Leau]]] and by the Ido project\".<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Leau\n|first=L\u00e9opold\n|date=August 1933\n|journal=Progreso\n|volume=X\n|issue=96\n|pages=4\n|title=La Vereso pri la Delegitaro en 1907\n|trans-title=The Truth about the Delegation in 1907\n|url=http://interlanguages.net/truth.html\n|accessdate=12 February 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ido Kongreso en Dessau 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The International Ido Congress in [[Dessau]], Germany, in 1922]]\n\nEsperanto's inventor, [[L. L. Zamenhof]], having heard a number of complaints, had suggested in 1894 a proposal for a [[Reformed Esperanto]] with several changes that Ido adopted and made it closer to French: eliminating the accented letters and the accusative case, changing the plural to an Italianesque ''-i'', and replacing the table of correlatives with more Latinate words. However, the Esperanto community voted and rejected Reformed Esperanto,<ref name=\"Dyer\"/> and likewise most rejected the recommendations of the 1907 Committee composed by 12 members. Zamenhof deferred to their judgment, although doubtful. Furthermore, controversy ensued when the \"Ido project\" was found to have been primarily devised by [[Louis de Beaufront]], whom  Zamenhof had chosen to represent Esperanto before the Committee, as the Committee's rules dictated that the creator of a submitted language could not defend it.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Jacob\n|first=Henry\n|year=1947\n|title=A Planned Auxiliary Language\n|chapter=II. Ido\n|url=http://interlanguages.net/PALih.html\n|accessdate=12 February 2012\n}}</ref> The Committee's language was French and not everyone could speak in French. When the president of the Committee asked who was the author of Ido's project, Couturat, Beaufront and Leau answered that they were not. Beaufront was the person who presented Ido's project and gave a description as a better, richer version of Esperanto. Couturat, Leau, Beaufront and Jespersen were finally the only members who voted, all of them for Ido's project. A month later, Couturat accidentally put Jespersen in a copy of a letter in which he acknowledged that Beaufront was the author of the Ido project. Jespersen was angered by this and asked for a public confession, which was never forthcoming.\n\nIt is estimated that some 20% of Esperanto leaders and 3\u20134% of ordinary Esperantists defected to Ido, which from then on suffered constant modifications seeking to perfect it, but which ultimately had the effect of causing many Ido speakers to give up on trying to learn it.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Lapenna\n|first=Ivo\n|authorlink=Ivo Lapenna\n|author2=Ulrich Lins |author3=Tazio Carlevaro\n |title=Esperanto en perspektivo: Faktoj kaj analizoj pri la internacia lingvo\n|year=1974\n|language=Esperanto\n|location=London\n|publisher=Centro de Esploro kaj Dokumentado pri la Monda Lingvo-Problemo\n|pages=424\n}}</ref> Although it fractured the Esperanto movement, the schism gave the remaining Esperantists the freedom to concentrate on using and promoting their language as it stood.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Harlow, Donald J \n |authorlink=Don Harlow \n |url=http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html#ido \n |title=Ido \n |work=How to Build a Language \n |date=4 July 2006 \n |accessdate=12 February 2012 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html \n |archivedate=4 February 2012 \n |df= \n}}</ref> At the same time, it gave the Idists freedom to continue working on their own language for several more years before actively promoting it.

A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain [[affix]]es between the root and the grammatical ending.\n\nSome of the grammatical endings are defined as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Esperanto marks noun plurals by an ''agglutinative'' ending ''-j'' (so plural nouns end in ''-oj''), uses ''-i'' for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses ''-u'' for the imperative. Verbs in Ido do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -'''as''', -'''is''', and -'''os''' endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else.\n\n===Syntax===\nIdo word order is generally the same as English ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]]), so the sentence ''Me havas la blua libro'' is the same as the English \"I have the blue book\", both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:\n* Adjectives can precede the noun as in English, or follow the noun as in Spanish. Thus, ''Me havas la libro blua'' means the same thing.\n* Ido has the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n''. Unlike Esperanto, this suffix is only required when the object of the sentence is not clear, for example, when the subject-verb-object word order is not followed. Thus, ''La blua libron me havas'' also means the same thing.\n\nIdo generally does not impose rules of grammatical [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between grammatical categories within a sentence. For example, the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject. Nor must the adjectives be pluralized as well the nouns{{spnd}}in Ido ''the large books'' would be ''la granda libri'' as opposed to the French ''les grands livres'' or the Esperanto ''la grandaj libroj''.\n\nNegation occurs in Ido by simply adding '''ne''' before a verb: '''Me ne havas libro''' means \"I do not have a book\". This as well does not vary, and thus the \"I do not\", \"He does not\", \"They do not\" before a verb are simply '''Me ne''', '''Il ne''', and '''Li ne'''. In the same way, past tense and future tense negatives are formed by '''ne''' before the conjugated verb. \"I will not go\" and \"I did not go\" become '''Me ne iros''' and '''Me ne iris''' respectively.\n\nYes/no questions are formed by the particle '''ka''' in front of the question. \"I have a book\" (me havas libro) becomes '''Ka me havas libro?''' (do I have a book?). '''Ka''' can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question, corresponding to the English \"is it?\" '''Ka Mark?''' can mean, \"Are you Mark?\", \"Is it Mark?\", \"Do you mean Mark?\" depending on the context.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe [[pronoun]]s of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in ''i''. Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns ''mi'' and ''ni'' may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has ''me'' and ''ni'' instead. Ido also distinguishes between [[T-V distinction|intimate (''tu'') and formal (''vu'')]] second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (''vi'') not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun ''lu'' (it can mean \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\", depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (''il''), feminine (''el''), and neuter (''ol'') third-person pronouns.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Pronouns\n!rowspan=\"3\"|\n!colspan=\"7\"|singular\n!colspan=\"6\" |plural\n!rowspan=\"3\"|reflexive\n!rowspan=\"3\"|indefinite\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|first\n!colspan=\"2\"|second\n!colspan=\"4\"|third\n!rowspan=\"2\"|first\n!rowspan=\"2\"|second\n!colspan=\"4\"|third\n|-\n!''familiar''\n!''formal''\n!''masculine''\n!''feminine''\n!''neuter''\n!''pan-gender''\n!''masculine''\n!''feminine''\n!''neuter''\n!''pan-gender''\n|-\n!Ido\n| me\n| tu\n| vu\n| il(u)\n| el(u)\n| ol(u)\n| lu\n| ni\n| vi\n| ili\n| eli\n| oli\n| li\n| su\n| on(u)\n|-\n!English\n| I\n| thou\n| you\n| he\n| she\n| it\n| \n| we\n| you\n|\n|\n|\n| they\n|\n| one\n|-\n!Esperanto\n| mi\n| ci\u00b9\n| vi\u00b9\n| li\n| \u015di\n| \u011di\n| \n| ni\n| vi\n|\n|\n|\n| ili\n| si\n| oni\n|}\n# ''ci'', although technically the familiar form of the word \"you\" in Esperanto, is seldom used. Esperanto's inventor himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using ''ci'' because different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of \"you\".<ref>Eventoj, no. 103, {{ISSN|1215-959X}}. ''Ci'' estas senvalora balasto (''Ci'' is useless ballast). 1996. Available at http://www.eventoj.hu/arkivo/eve-103.htm</ref>\n\nIt should be noted that ''ol'', like English ''it'' and Esperanto ''\u011di'', is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used \"for entities whose sex is indeterminate: ''babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, [cattle], cats,'' etc.\"\n\n''Lu'' is often mistakenly labeled an [[epicene]] pronoun, that is, one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings, but in fact, ''lu'' is more properly a \"pan-gender\" pronoun, as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects. From ''Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido'' by Beaufront:\n\n{{quote|\n''Lu'' (like ''li'') is used ''for all three genders.'' That ''lu'' does duty for the three genders at will in the singular is not in itself any more astonishing than seeing ''li'' serve the three genders at will in the plural ... By a decision (1558) the Idist Academy rejected every restriction concerning the use of ''lu.'' One may thus use that pronoun in exactly the same way for a thing and a person of obvious sex as for animals of unknown sex and a person that has a genderless name, like ''baby, child, human,'' etc., these being as truly masculine as feminine.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe motives for this decision were given in \"Mondo\", XI, 68: ''Lu'' for the singular is exactly the same as ''li'' for the plural. Logic, symmetry and ease demand this. Consequently, just as ''li'' may be used for people, animals, and things whenever nothing obliges one to express the gender, so ''lu'' may be used for people, animals, and things under the same condition. The proposed distinction would be a bothersome subtlety&nbsp;...\n}}\n\n===Table of correlatives===\nIdo makes correlatives by combining entire words together and changing the word ending, with some irregularities to show distinction.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |\n!Relative and\ninterrogative\n!Demonstrative\n!Indeterminate\n!Most\nIndeterminate\n!Negative\n!Collective\n|-\n!qua, \u2205\n!ita, \u2205\n!ula, \u2205\n!irga\n!nula\n!omna\n|-\n!Individual\n!-u\n| style=\"background: #fff1d8\" | qua\n| style=\"background: #fff1d8\" | ita <sup>1</sup>\n|ulu\n|irgu\n|nulu\n|omnu\n|-\n!Thing\n!-o\n|quo\n|ito <sup>1</sup>\n|ulo\n|irgo\n|nulo\n|omno\n|-\n!Plural\n!-i\n|qui\n|iti <sup>1</sup>\n|uli\n|irgi\n|nuli\n|omni\n|-\n!Adjective\n!-a\n| style=\"background: #fff1d8\" | qua\n| style=\"background: #fff1d8\" | ita <sup>1</sup>\n|ula\n|irga\n|nula\n|omna\n|-\n!Motive\n!pro\n|pro quo\n|pro to\n|pro ulo\n|pro irgo\n|pro nulo\n|pro omno\n|-\n!Place\n!loke\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | ube\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | ibe\n|ulaloke\n|irgaloke\n|nulaloke\n|omnaloke\n|-\n!Time\n!tempe\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | kande\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | lore\n|ulatempe <sup>2</sup>\n|irgatempe\n|nulatempe <sup>2</sup>\n| style=\"background: #d8ffd8\" | sempre <sup>3</sup>\n|-\n!Quality\n!-a, speca\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | quala\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | tala\n|ulaspeca <sup>2</sup>\n|irgaspeca\n|nulaspeca <sup>2</sup>\n|omnaspeca\n|-\n!Manner\n!-e, maniere\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | quale\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | tale\n|ule, ulamaniere <sup>2</sup>\n|irge, irgamaniere\n|nule, nulamaniere <sup>2</sup>\n|omne, omnamaniere\n|-\n!Quantity -\nadjective\n!quanta\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | quanta\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | tanta\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | kelka\n|irgaquanta\n|nulaquanta\n|omnaquanta\n|-\n!Quantity -\nnoun\n!quanto\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | quanto\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | tanto\n| style=\"background: #ffd8d8\" | kelko\n| style=\"background: #d8ffd8\" | irga quanto <sup>4</sup>\n| style=\"background: #d8ffd8\" | nula quanto <sup>4</sup>\n| style=\"background: #d8ffd8\" | la tota quanto <sup>4</sup>\n|}\n\n# The initial ''i'' can be omitted: ''ta'', ''to'', ''ti'', ''ta''.\n# One can omit the initial ''a'': ''ultempe'', ''nultempe'', ''ulspeca'', ''nulspeca'', ''ulmaniere'', ''nulmaniere''.\n# ''omnatempe'' is correct and usable, but ''sempre'' is the actual word.\n# Instead of ''irga quanto'', ''nula quanto'' and ''la tota quanto'' one usually says ''irgo'', ''nulo'' and ''omno''.\n===Compounds formation===\n\nComposition in Ido obeys stricter rules than in esperanto, especially\nnames, adectives and verbs formations from a radical of a different\nclass.  The reversibility principle assume that for each composition\nrule (affix addition), decomposition rule (affix remove) is valid.\n\nHenceforth, while in esperanto an adjective (for instance {{lang|eo|papera}}, formed on the radical {{lang|eo|papero}) can mean an attribute ({{lang|eo|papera enciklopedio}}: \u201cpaper-made encyclopedia\u201d), and a relation ({{lang|eo|papera fabriko}}: \u201cpaper-making factory\u201d), Ido will distinguish per construction the attribute {{lang|eo|papera}} (\u201cpaper\u201d or \u201cof paper\u201d (not \u201cpaper-made\u201d exactely)) from the relation {{lang|eo|paper'''al'''a}} (\u201cpaper-making\u201d).\n\nSimilarily, {{lang|eo|krono}} mean in both Esperanto and Ido \u201ccrown\u201d; where Esperanto allow formation of \u201cto crown\u201d by simple {{lang|eo|kroni}} (\u201ccrowning\u201d is {{lang|eo|kronado}}), Ido requires an affix so the composition is reversible: {{lang|eo|kron'''iz'''ar}} (\u201cthe fact to crown\u201d is {{lang|eo|kron'''iz'''o}}).\n\nAccording [[Claude Piron]], some modifications brought by Ido are in practice impossible to use and ruin spontaneous expression: <blockquote>Ido displays, on linguistic level, other drawbacks Esperanto succeeded to avoid, but I don\u2019t have at hand documents which would allow me to go further in detail.  For instance, if I remember correctly, where Esperanto only has the suffix {{lang|eo|-igi}}*, Ido has several: *{{lang|io|-ifar}}*, *{{lang|io|-izar}}*, *{{lang|io|-igar}}*, which match subtleties which were meant to make language clearer, but that, in practice, inhibit natural expression.<ref>http://claudepiron.free.fr/lettresouvertes/ido.htm</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nVocabulary in Ido is derived from French, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and Russian. Basing the vocabulary on various widespread languages was intended to make Ido as easy as possible for the greatest number of people possible. Early on, the first 5,371 Ido word roots were analyzed compared to the vocabulary of the six source languages, and the following result was found:<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Dyer\n|first=Luther H\n|year=1923\n|title=The Problem of an International Auxiliary Language and its Solution in Ido\n|url=http://interlanguages.net/101_121.htm\n|pages=101\u2013121\n|accessdate=19 January 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n* 2024 roots (38%) belong to 6 languages\n* 942 roots (17%) belong to 5 languages\n* 1111 roots (21%) belong to 4 languages\n* 585 roots (11%) belong to 3 languages\n* 454 roots (8%) belong to 2 languages\n* 255 roots (5%) belong to 1 language\n\nAnother analysis showed that:\n\n* 4880 roots (91%) are found in French\n* 4454 roots (83%) are found in Italian\n* 4237 roots (79%) are found in Spanish\n* 4219 roots (79%) are found in English\n* 3302 roots (61%) are found in German\n* 2821 roots (52%) are found in Russian\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of Ido vocabulary with its six source languages\n|-\n!

This allows a user to take existing words and modify them to create [[neologism]]s when necessary, and allows for a wide range of expression without the need to learn new vocabulary each time. Though their number is too large to be included in one article, some examples include:\n*The diminutive suffix '''-et-'''. '''Domo''' (house) becomes '''dometo''' (cottage), and '''libro''' (book) becomes '''libreto''' (novelette or short story).\n*The pejorative suffix '''-ach-'''. '''Domo''' becomes '''domacho''' (hovel), and '''libro''' becomes '''libracho''' (a shoddy piece of work, pulp fiction, etc.)\n*The prefix '''retro-''', which implies a reversal. '''Irar''' (to go) becomes '''retroirar''' (to go back, backward) and '''venar''' (to come) becomes '''retrovenar''' (to return).\n\nNew vocabulary is generally created through an analysis of the word, its [[etymology]], and reference to the six source languages. If a word can be created through vocabulary already existing in the language then it will usually be adopted without need for a new radical (such as '''wikipedio''' for ''Wikipedia'', which consists of '''wiki''' + '''enciklopedio''' for ''encyclopedia''), and if not an entirely new word will be created. The word '''alternatoro''' for example was adopted in 1926, likely because five of the six source languages used largely the same [[orthography]] for the word, and because it was long enough to avoid being mistaken for other words in the existing vocabulary.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://interlanguages.net/nova.html\n|title=Lexiko di nova vorti\n|trans-title=Lexicon of new words\n|author=De Cock, Camiel\n|year=1988\n|accessdate=19 January 2012\n}}</ref> Adoption of a word is done through consensus, after which the word will be made official by the [[Uniono por la Linguo Internaciona Ido|union]]. Care must also be taken to avoid [[homonym]]s if possible, and usually a new word undergoes some discussion before being adopted. Foreign words that have a restricted sense and are not likely to be used in everyday life (such as the word ''intifada'' to refer to the conflict between [[Israel]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]]) are left untouched, and often written in italics.\n\nIdo, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male sex by default. For example, Ido does not derive the word for \u201cwaitress\u201d by adding a feminine suffix to \u201cwaiter\u201d, as Esperanto does. Instead, Ido words are defined as sex-neutral, and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine words from the root: ''{{lang|io|servisto}}'' for a waiter of either sex, ''{{lang|io|servistulo}}'' for a male waiter, and ''{{lang|io|servistino}}'' for a waitress. There are only two exceptions to this rule:<ref name=\"Chandler\"/> First, ''{{lang|io|patro}}'' for \u201cfather\u201d, ''{{lang|io|matro}}'' for \u201cmother\u201d, and ''{{lang|io|genitoro}}'' for \u201cparent\u201d, and second, ''{{lang|io|viro}}'' for \u201cman\u201d, ''{{lang|io|muliero}}'' for \u201cwoman\u201d, and ''{{lang|io|adulto}}'' for \u201cadult\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://idomondo.org/skolo.1.6.pdf#page=42 |title=Ido for All |date=2008 |pages=42,&nbsp;52,&nbsp;70 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125103925/http://idomondo.org/skolo.1.6.pdf#page=42 |archive-date=25 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |first1=Niklas |last1=ApGawain |first2=P.&nbsp;D. |last2=Hugon |first3=J.&nbsp;L. |last3=Moore |first4=Louis |last4=De Beaufront |editor-first=Jerry |editor-last=Muelver |publisher=North American Ido Society |edition=1.6 |orig-year=1st pub. 1999 |format=PDF |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Sample==\n{{listen\n|filename=Padrenuestro.ogg\n|title=The Lord's Prayer in Ido\n}}\n[[The Lord's Prayer]]:\n\n{|\n| style=\"padding-left:1em\" | '''Ido'''\nPatro nia, qua esas en la cielo,<br/>\ntua nomo santigesez;<br/>\ntua regno advenez;<br/>\ntua volo facesez<br/>\nquale en la cielo, tale anke sur la tero.<br/>\nDonez a ni cadie l'omnadiala pano,<br/>\ne pardonez a ni nia ofensi,<br/>\nquale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,<br/>\ne ne duktez ni aden la tento,<br/>\nma liberigez ni del malajo.<br/>\n| style=\"padding-left:2em\" | '''English'''\nOur Father, who is in heaven,<br/>\nhallowed be your name.<br/>\nYour kingdom come,<br/>\nyour will be done,<br/>\non earth as it is in heaven.<br/>\nGive us this day our daily bread,<br/>\nand forgive us our debts,<br/>\nas we also have forgiven our debtors.<br/>\nAnd lead us not into temptation,<br/>\nbut deliver us from evil.<br/>\n|}\n\n==Literature and publications==\nIdo has a number of publications that can be subscribed to or downloaded for free in most cases. ''Kuriero Internaciona'' is a magazine produced in France every few months with a range of topics. ''Adavane!'' is a magazine produced by the Spanish Ido Society every two months that has a range of topics, as well as a few dozen pages of work translated from other languages. ''Progreso'' is the official organ of the Ido movement and has been around since the inception of the movement in 1908. Other sites can be found with various stories, fables or proverbs along with a few books of the Bible translated into Ido on a smaller scale. The site ''publikaji'' has a few podcasts in Ido along with various songs and other recorded material.\n\n[[Wikipedia]] includes an [http://io.wikipedia.org/ Ido-language edition] (known in Ido as ''Wikipedio'');

In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].\n\nImprovisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.\n\nImprovisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]]. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=B\u00e9atrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers\u2019 Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>. It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.<ref>''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed. Alison Hodge. New York: Routledge, 2012.</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Nobel-winner [[Dario Fo]] received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style]]\nModern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the [[progressive education]] movement initiated by [[John Dewey]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/tspwb1hist.html|title=TheatreSports History|work=interactiveimprov.com}}</ref> Some people credit American [[Dudley Riggs]] as the first [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',<ref name=\"Spolin\">{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}</ref> the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''\n\nSpolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.<ref name=Wonderful>The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book \"Something Wonderful Right Away\" (Limelight Editions, 2004)</ref><ref name=Compass>Janet Coleman's \"The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy\" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).</ref>\n\nMany of the current \"rules\" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.<ref name=Wonderful /><ref name=Compass />\n\nMany of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].\n[[File:Ligue d'improvisation montr\u00e9alaise (LIM) 20110306.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the Montreal Improvisation League]]\nSimultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.\n\nIn 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as World Comedy League and boasts a roster of 24 international cities.\n\nIn San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.\n\nModern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s \"happenings\" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s \"Forum Theatre\" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.\n\n[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.\n\nIn 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre & Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> \n\nIn 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}</ref>\n\nRob Wittig and Mark C.

Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> The shortform improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.\n\nLongform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]]; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Detroit]], [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; and is building a growing following in [[Denver]], [[Montreal]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[New Orleans]], [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}</ref> and [[Hawaii]]. Outside the [[United States]], longform improv has a growing presence in the [[United Kingdom]], especially in cities such as [[London]],<ref>[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}</ref> [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].\n\n==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==\nOther forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde<ref>Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans</ref> in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.\n\n[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as \"sound and movement\" and \"transformations\", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s \"[[poor theater]]\" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason=\"[1]\"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.\n\nLongform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.\n\n==Applying improv principles in life==\nMany people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}</ref> For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,<ref>Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all.

In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html \"Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?\"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, \"executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves.\"\n\n==In film and television==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\nMany directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.\n\nSome of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Rob Reiner]].\n\nImprov comedy techniques have also been used in television and [[Stand-up comedian|stand-up comedy]] in hit shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}</ref> and ''[[The Thick of It]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}</ref> also had some improvised elements in them.\n\n==Psychology==\nIn the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569780120070722#preview |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179\u2013191}}</ref> According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}</ref> Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.\n\nIn the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, and\"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and process==\nImprovisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.\n\nIn order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect\u2014this is known as ''gagging''\u2014but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|\"Yes, And...\"]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''\"Yes, And...\"'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a \"base (or shared) reality\" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''\"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)\"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014</ref>\n\nThe unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.<ref name=\"Spolin\"/> As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or \"miraculously\" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.\n\nBecause improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.\n\n==Community==\nMany theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.\n\nIn addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.\n\n==Notable Contributors To The Field==\nSome key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer\u2013author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of \"Commun-edy Outreach\" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.\n\n[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true \"people's Theatre\", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of \"That Movie In Your Head\", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name \"ImprovOlympic\" and now as \"IO\"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's \"Time Dash\" game with Del Close's \"Harold\" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.<ref>An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.\n\n[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the \"second generation\" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the \"Clap-In\" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.\n\nGunter L\u00f6sel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.<ref>''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativit\u00e4t des Improvisationstheaters''.
