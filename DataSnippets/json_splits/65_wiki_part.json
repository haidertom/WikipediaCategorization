The neighborhood is bounded on the north by SE Woodstock Boulevard. The western boundary is a combination of SE 28th Avenue, SE Bybee Boulevard, and SE 27th Avenue. SE Crystal Springs Boulevard serves as the neighborhood's southern boundary, and gradually curves north to Eastmoreland's eastern boundary, SE 39th Avenue, recently renamed SE [[Cesar Chavez Boulevard (Portland, Oregon)|C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard]]. The [[Reed College]] campus is located on the opposite side of SE Woodstock, bordering northern Eastmoreland.\n\nEastmoreland is filled with trees and lush landscaping. Public parks in Eastmoreland include [[Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden]] (1923), Eastmoreland Golf Course (1916), and [[Berkeley Park (Portland, Oregon)|Berkeley Park]] (1941). There is also a median on Reed College Place which is owned by Portland Department of Transportation and maintained by [[Portland Parks & Recreation]].\n\nEastmoreland was named for a local real estate developer, Judge [[Julius C.

name=\"hls\"/> was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] physician and medical researcher who received the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his work in the physiology, pathology and surgery of the [[thyroid]]. Among his many accomplishments are the introduction and promotion of aseptic surgery and scientific methods in surgery, specifically reducing the mortality of [[Thyroidectomy|thyroidectomies]] below 1% in his operations.\n\nHe was the first Swiss citizen and the first surgeon to ever receive a Nobel prize. He was considered a pioneer and leader in the field of surgery in his time.<ref name=\"gautschi2009\"/>\n\n== Early life and personal life ==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nKocher's father was Jakob Alexander Kocher (1814\u20131893),<ref name=\"burgerbib_kocher_ja\"/> the sixth of seven children to Samuel Kocher (1771\u20131842), a carpenter, and Barbara Sutter (1772\u20131849).<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Jakob Alexander Kocher was a railway engineer and he moved in 1845 to [[Burgdorf, Switzerland]] (near [[Bern]]), because of his job as regional engineer of [[Emmental]] (''Bezirksingenieur'').<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> He was named chief engineer for street and water in the [[canton of Bern]] at the age of 34 years and he moved with his family to the capital, the city of Bern.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> In 1858 he left the states service and managed several engineering projects around Bern.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nTheodor Kocher's mother was Maria Kocher (n\u00e9e Wermuth)<ref name=\"hls\"/> living from 1820 to 1900.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> She was a very religious woman and part of the [[Moravian Church]]; together with Jakob Alexander, she raised a family of five sons and one daughter (Theodor Kocher was the second son).\n\nTheodor Kocher was born on 25 August 1841 in Bern and baptized in the local [[Bern Minster]] on 16 September 1841.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Together with the family, he moved to Burgdorf in 1845 where he started school. Later his family moved back to Bern where he went to middle and high school (''Realschule'' and ''Literaturgymnasium'') where he was the first of his class.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> During high school, Theodor was interested in many subjects and was specifically drawn to art and [[classical philology]] but finally decided to become a doctor.<ref name=\"bonjour1950\"/>\n\n=== Studies ===\nHe started his studies after obtaining the Swiss [[Matura]] in 1858 at the [[University of Bern]] where [[Michael Anton Biermer|Anton Biermer]] and [[Hermann Askan Demme]] were teaching, two professors that impressed him most.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> He was a studious and dedicated student but still became a member of the [[Schweizerischer Zofingerverein]], a [[Studentenverbindung|Swiss fraternity]].\nHe obtained his doctorate in Bern in 1865<ref name=\"choong2009\"/><ref name=\"www.nobelprize.org\"/> (March 1865)<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> or 1866<ref name=\"hls\"/> <!-- see talk page, section Year_of_dissertation --><ref group=\"note\">While the dissertation was published in 1866 and the HLS refers to 1866 as date of promotion and 1865 as date of completing his studies, all other sources point to 1865 as the date where Kocher obtained his doctorate</ref> with his dissertation about ''Behandlung der croup\u00f6sen Pneumonie mit Veratrum-Pr\u00e4paraten'' (literal English translation: ''The treatment of croupous pneumonia with [[Veratrum]] preparations.'') under professor Biermer with the predicate ''summa cum laude unamimiter''.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nIn spring 1865, Kocher followed his teacher Biermer to [[Z\u00fcrich]], where [[Theodor Billroth]] was director of the hospital and influenced Kocher significantly.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/> Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female [[Suisse romande]] philanthropist who also supported his friend [[Marc Dufour (ophthalmologist)|Marc Dufour]] and was probably a member of the [[Moravian Church]].<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> In October 1865, he traveled to [[Berlin]], passing through [[Leipzig]] and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under [[Bernhard von Langenbeck]] and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and [[Rudolf Virchow]]. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met [[Jonathan Hutchinson]] and then worked for [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet|Henry Thompson]] and [[John Eric Erichsen|John Erichsen]]. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of [[Isaac Baker Brown]] and [[Thomas Spencer Wells]], who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet [[Auguste N\u00e9laton]], [[Aristide Auguste Stanislas Verneuil|Auguste Verneuil]] and [[Louis Pasteur]]. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nOnce returned to Bern, Kocher prepared for his [[habilitation]] and on 12 October 1867, he wrote a petition to the ministry of education to award him the ''[[venia docendi]]'' (Latin: ''to instruct'') which was granted to him.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> He became assistant to [[Georg Albert L\u00fccke|Georg L\u00fccke]] who left Bern in 1872 to become professor in [[Strasbourg]].<ref group=\"note\">Choong (2009) claims that Kocher became assistant in Bern already in 1866 but according to Bonjour, Kocher was then still in Berlin</ref> Kocher was hoping to get his position, but at the time it was customary to appoint German professors to positions at Swiss universities. Accordingly, the faculty suggested [[Franz K\u00f6nig (surgeon)|Franz K\u00f6nig]] before Kocher to follow L\u00fccke. However, the students and assistants as well as many doctors preferred Kocher and started a petition to the Bernese government to choose Kocher. Also the press was in favor of Kocher and several famous foreign surgeons, such as Langenbeck from Berlin and Billroth from [[Vienna]], wrote letters in support of Kocher. Under this public pressure, the Bernese government (''Regierungsrat'') chose Kocher as the successor of L\u00fccke as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and Director of the [[University of Bern|University]] Surgical Clinic at the ''[[Inselspital]]'' on 16 March 1872, despite a different proposal by the faculty.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\n=== Personal life ===\nIn 1869, he married Marie Witschi-Courant<ref name=\"hildebrandt2012\"/><ref group=\"note\">Several alternative spellings to Marie Witschi-Courant exist, for example\n Maria Witschi (ref hls),\n Witchi (ref choong2009),\n Witchi-Cournant (ref tan2008),\n Maria Witschi but in letters \"Marie\" (ref: [http://katalog.burgerbib.ch/deskriptordetail.aspx?ID=137721 Descriptor]</ref> <!-- see talk page, section Name_and_person_info_of_his_wife --> (1841\u20131921)<ref name=\"choong2009\"/><ref name=\"www.nobelprize.org\"/> or (1850<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> \u2013 1925).<ref group=\"note\">The Bernese Burgerbibliothek give 1850-1925 as her living years and also Bonjour 1981 writes (pg 86) that she was nineteen in 1869 but does not give a date of death</ref> She was the daughter of Johannes Witschi who was a [[merchant]]<ref name=\"hls\"/> and she had three sons together with Kocher. The Kochers first lived at the Marktgasse in Bern and moved in 1875 to a bigger house in the Villette. The house became a place for friends, colleagues and guests to gather and many patients from Kocher's clinic were invited to dine at the Villette.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nLike his mother, Kocher was a deeply religious man and also part of the [[Moravian Church]]. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God. He thought that the rise of [[materialism]] (especially in science) was a great evil, and he attributed the outbreak of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nKocher was involved in the education of his three sons and played tennis with them and went horseback riding with them.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> The eldest son Albert (1872\u20131941)<ref name=\"www.nobelprize.org\"/> would follow him to the surgical clinic in Bern and become Assistant Professor of Surgery.<ref name=\"tan2008\"/>\n\nOn the evening of 23 July 1917, he was called into the Inselspital for an emergency. Kocher executed the surgery but afterwards felt unwell and went to bed, working on scientific notes. He then fell unconscious and died on 27 July 1917.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\n== Career ==\n\nThe call for an ordinary professorship at the University of Bern at the age of 30 was the first big career step for Theodor Kocher. In the 45 years he served as professor at the university, he oversaw the re-building of the famous Bernese [[Inselspital]], published 249 scholarly articles and books, trained numerous medical doctors and treated thousands of patients. He made major contributions to the fields of applied surgery, [[neurosurgery]] and, especially, [[thyroid]] surgery and [[endocrinology]]. For his work he received, among other honors, the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. According to Asher, the field of surgery has transformed radically during the time of Theodore Kocher and later generations will build on the foundations created by Kocher \u2013 if a future historian wanted to describe the state of surgery at the beginning of the 20th century, he only need mention Kocher's ''Text-Book of Operative Surgery''.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> <!-- page 63 -->\n\nThree main factors contributed to Kocher's success as a surgeon, according to Bonjour (1981). The first factor was his consequent implementation of antiseptic wound treatment which prevented infection and later death of the patients. The second factor, according to [[Erich Hintzsche]], was his monitoring of the [[anesthesia]] where he used special masks and later used [[local anesthesia]] for [[goitre]] surgery which decreased or removed the dangers of anesthesia. As a third factor, Hintzsche mentions the minimal blood loss which Kocher achieved. Even the smallest source of blood during surgery was precisely controlled and inhibited by Kocher, initially because he thought that decomposing blood would constitute an infection risk for the patient.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> <!-- page 63-67 -->\n\n=== Early career ===\nKocher first attained international recognition with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870.<ref name=\"hls\"/><ref name=\"gemsenjager2011\"/> The new procedure was much less painful and safer than the traditionally used procedure and could be performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/><!-- Bonjour 1981 pg 60 --> In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds and how they can cause [[bone fracture]]s. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 ''Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet'' (English: ''The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.'') and an 1875 manuscript ''Ueber die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse'' (English: ''Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.'') He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\n=== Relocation of Inselspital and call to Prague ===\nAs soon as Kocher became professor, he wanted to modernize the practices at the Bernese [[Inselspital]]. He noticed that the old building did not suffice the modern standards and was too small \u2013 half of the patients seeking medical attention had to be turned away.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> In spring 1878, he visited several institutions around Europe to evaluate novel innovations for hospitals and implement them if possible in Bern. He wrote down his observations in a lengthy report for the Bernese government, giving instructions even for architectonic details. In a speech on 15 November 1878, he informed the general public about the pressing needs of a new hospital building. Finally, he used his call to [[Prague]] to pressure the government: He would only stay in Bern if he was either granted 75 beds in the new building or would get money to increase his facilities in the old building. Finally, in the winter of 1884/1885 the new building was finished and the [[Inselspital]] could be moved.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nAt the time, [[Prague]] had the third largest university clinic in the German speaking world and it was a great honor for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new [[Inselspital]] building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the number of beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\n=== Aseptic surgery ===\nIt is unclear whether Kocher directly knew [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who pioneered the antiseptic (using chemical means to kill bacteria) method, but Kocher was in correspondence with him.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Kocher had recognized the importance of aseptic techniques early on, introducing them to his peers at a time when this was considered revolutionary. In a hospital report from 1868, he attributed the lower mortality directly to the \"antiseptic Lister's wound bandaging method\" and he could later as director of the clinic order strict adherence to the antiseptic method.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Bonjour (1981) describes how his assistants were worried about wound infection for fear of having to explain their failure to Kocher himself.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Kocher made it a matter of principle to investigate the cause of every wound infection and remove every potential source of infection, he also banned visitors from his surgeries for this reason.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nHe published multiple works on aseptic treatment and surgery.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/>\n\n=== Contributions to Neurosurgery ===\n\nKocher also contributed significantly to the field of neurology and [[neurosurgery]]. In this area, his research was pioneering and covered the areas of [[concussion]], neurosurgery and [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP).<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Furthermore, he investigated the surgical treatment of [[epilepsy]] and spinal and cranial trauma. He found that in some cases, the epilepsy patients had a brain tumor which could be surgically removed. He hypothesized that epilepsy was caused by an increase in ICP and believed that drainage of cerebrospinal fluid could cure epilepsy.<ref name=\"hildebrandt2012\"/>\n\nThe Japanese surgeon [[Hayazo Ito]] came to Bern in 1896 in order to perform experimental research on epilepsy. Kocher was especially interested in the ICP during experimentally induced epilepsy and after Ito returned to Japan, he performed over 100 surgeries in epilepsy patients.<ref name=\"hildebrandt2012\"/>\n\nThe American surgeon [[Harvey Williams Cushing|Harvey Cushing]] spent several months in the lab of Kocher in 1900, performing cerebral surgery and first encountering the [[Cushing reflex]] which describes the relationship between [[blood pressure]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Kocher later also found that [[decompressive craniectomy]] was an effective method to lower ICP.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/>\n\nIn his surgery textbook ''Chirurgische Operationslehre'', Kocher dedicated 141 pages of 1060 pages to surgery of the nervous system. It included methods of exploration and decompression of the brain.<ref name=\"hildebrandt2012\"/>\n\n=== Contributions to Thyroid surgery ===\n\nThyroid surgery, which was mostly performed as treatment of [[goitre]] with a complete [[thyroidectomy]] when possible, was considered a risky procedure when Kocher started his work. Some estimates put the mortality of thyroidectomy as high as 75% in 1872.<ref name=\"chiesa2009\" /> Indeed, the operation was believed to be one of the most dangerous operations and in France it was prohibited by the Academy of Medicine at the time.<ref name=\"chiesa2009\" /> Through application of modern surgical methods, such as antiseptic wound treatment and minimizing blood loss, and the famous slow and precise style of Kocher, he managed to reduce the mortality of this operation from an already low 18% (compared to contemporary standards) to less than 0.5% by 1912.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/> By then, Kocher had performed over 5000 <!-- 4250 by 1909 according to Gemsenj\u00e4ger, 7052 in total, 5314 by Kocher himself. According to Bonjour, the mortality went down to 0.1% in 1917-->thyroid excisions.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/>  The success of Kocher's methods, especially when compared to operations performed by [[Theodor Billroth]] who was also performing thyroidectomies at that time, was described by [[William Stewart Halsted]] as follows:\n{{Quote|text=I have pondered the question for many years and conclude that the explanation probably lies in the operative methods of the two illustrious surgeons. Kocher, neat and precise, operating in a relatively bloodless manner, scrupulously removed the entire thyroid gland doing little damage outside its capsule.  Billroth, operating more rapidly and, as I recall, with less regard for the tissues and less concern for hemorrhage, might easily have removed the parathyroids or at least have interfered with their blood supply, and have left fragments of the thyroid.  |sign=[[William Stewart Halsted]] |source=Halstead WS. The operative story of goitre. Johns Hopkins Hosp Rep 1919;19:71-257. -- Quoted in Morris et al.\n<ref name=\"morris1990\"/>}}\n\nKocher and others later discovered that the complete removal of the [[thyroid]] could lead to [[cretinism]] (termed ''cachexia strumipriva'' by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner [[August Fetscherin]]<ref name=\"hintzsche1970\"/> and later in 1882 by [[Jacques-Louis Reverdin]] together with his assistant [[Auguste Reverdin]] (1848-1908).<ref name=\"hls\"/> Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in [[Geneva]] at the international hygienic congress (''internationaler Hygienekongress'') and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher.<ref name=\"schlich1998\"/> Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely.<ref name=\"troehler2010\"/> Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely and led to the severe side effects of [[cretinism]].\n\nKocher came to the conclusion that a complete removal of the thyroid (as it was common to perform at the time because the function of the thyroid was not yet clear) was not advisable, a finding that he made public on 4 April 1883 in a lecture to the German Society of Surgery and also published in 1883 under the title ''Ueber Kropfexstirpation und ihre Folgen'' (English: ''About Thyroidectomies and their consequences'').<ref name=\"kocher1883\"/> Reverdin had already made his findings public on 13 September 1882<ref name=\"schlich1998\"/> and published further articles on this topic in 1883; yet still Kocher never acknowledged Reverdin's priority in this discovery.<ref name=\"hls\"/><ref name=\"gemsenjager2011\"/> At the time, the reactions to Kocher's lecture were mixed, some people asserted that [[goitre]] and [[cretinism]] were different stages of same disease and that cretinism would have occurred independently of the removal of the thyroid in the cases which Kocher described.<ref name=\"schlich1998\"/> <!-- pg 52 https://books.google.com/books?id=SInlUoFTKZcC&pg=PA52 --> In the long run however, these observations contributed to a more complete understanding of thyroid function and were one of the early hints of a connection between the thyroid and [[Congenital hypothyroidism|congenital cretinism]]. These findings finally enabled thyroid hormone replacement therapies for a variety of thyroid related diseases.<ref name=\"morris1990\"/>\n\n=== Further contributions to science ===\n\nKocher published works on a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland, including [[hemostasis]], antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute [[osteomyelitis]], the theory of strangulated [[hernia]], and abdominal surgery. The prize money, from the Nobel prize he received, helped him to establish the Kocher Institute in Bern.  <!-- TODO expand -->\n\nA number of instruments (for example the [[Craniometry|craniometer]]<ref name=\"schueltke2009\"/>) and surgical techniques (for example, the [[Kocher manoeuvre]], and [[Laparotomy#Types of incisions|kocher incision]]) are named after him, as well as the [[Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome]]. The Kocher manoeuvre is still a standard practice in orthopaedics.<ref name=\"gautschi2009\"/> Kocher is also credited for the invention in 1882 of the Kocher's Surgical Clamp, which he used to prevent blood loss during surgery.<ref name=\"gemsenjager2011\"/>\n\nOne of his main works, ''Chirurgische Operationslehre'' (Text-Book of Operative Surgery <ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/textbookofoperat00koch|title=Text-book of operative surgery|first1=Theodor|last1=Kocher|first2=Harold Jalland|last2=Stiles|date=7 January 1895|publisher=London : Adam and Charles Black|access-date=7 January 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>), was published through six editions and translated into many languages.<ref name=\"choong2009\"/>\n\nDuring his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates.<ref name=\"gautschi2009\"/> He was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university in 1878 and 1903.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> He was president of the Bernese and the Swiss physicians association and co-founded the Swiss society for surgery in 1913 and became its first president.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/>\n\nIn 1904 or 1905 he built a private clinic called \"Ulmenhof\" which had space for 25 patients. Here Kocher catered to the wealthier patients, which in many cases were international.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> He also treated the wife of [[Lenin]], [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] and operated on her in Bern (in 1913<ref name=\"g26\"/>).<ref name=\"gemsenjager2011\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Karl H\u00e4nny B\u00fcste Theodor Kocher 3.jpg|thumb|Bust of Theodor Kocher (created by [[Karl H\u00e4nny]])]]\n\nKocher was also a famous and loved teacher. During nearly 100 semesters he taught his knowledge to about 10 000 students of the University of Bern. He was able to inspire students and taught them to think clearly and logically. Specifically, Kocher also taught a generation of Jewish-Russian students who could not study in Russia.<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> This association with Russia has also led the [[Russian Geographical Society]] to name a volcano after him (in the area of Ujun-Choldongi <ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> in  [[Manchuria]] <ref name=\"gemsenjager2011\"/> ).\n\nAmong his many local and international students were\nCarl Arend (Bern),\n[[Oscar Bernhard]] (St. Moritz), <!-- de wikipedia -->\nAndrea Crotti (Ohio),\nGustave Dardel (Bern),\n[[Carl Garr\u00e9]] (Bonn),\nGottlieb and Max Feurer (St. Gallen),\nAnton Fonio (Langnau), <!-- http://www.marcel-benoist.ch/der-preis/bisherige-preistraeger/detail/?id=32  http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D14364.php -->\nWalter Gr\u00f6bly (Arbon),\nCarl Kaufmann (Z\u00fcrich),\nAlbert Kocher (Bern),\nJoseph Kopp (Luzern),\nErnst Kummer (Geneva),\n[[Otto Lanz]] (Amsterdam), <!-- de wikipedia -->\nEdmond Lardy (Geneva) <!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11450201 -->\nJakob Lauper (Interlaken),\nAlbert L\u00fcthi (Thun),\nHermann Matti (Bern),\nCharles Pettavel (Neuenburg),\nPaul Pf\u00e4hler (Olten),\n[[Fritz de Quervain]] (La Chaux de Fonds / Basel / Bern),\nAugust Rickli (Langenthal),\nErnst Rieben (Interlaken),\nAugust Rollier (Leysin), <!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2248938/ -->\n[[C\u00e9sar Roux]] (Lausanne),\nKarl Schuler (Rorschach), <!-- http://www.historyofsurgery.co.uk/Web%20Pages/0482.htm -->\nFritz Steinmann (Bern),\nAlbert Vogel (Luzern),\nHans Wildbolz (Bern) as well as <!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1095523 -->\nthe American neurosurgeon [[Harvey Cushing]].<ref name=\"bonjour1981\"/> Other notable students of his include [[Hayazo Ito]] (1865 - 1929) and S.

Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general '''''n'' queens problem''' of placing ''n'' non-attacking queens on an ''n''\u00d7''n'' chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers ''n'' with the exception of ''n''=2 and ''n''=3.<ref>E. J. Hoffman et al., \"Construction for the Solutions of the m Queens Problem\". ''Mathematics Magazine'', Vol. XX (1969), pp.&nbsp;66\u201372. [http://penguin.ewu.edu/~trolfe/QueenLasVegas/Hoffman.pdf]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Chess composer]] [[Max Bezzel]] published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. [[Franz Nauck]] published the first solutions in 1850.<ref name=\"rouse_ball_1960\">[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) \"The Eight Queens Problem\", in ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays'', Macmillan, New York, pp. 165\u2013171.</ref> Nauck also extended the puzzle to the ''n'' queens problem, with ''n'' queens on a [[chessboard]] of ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' squares.\n\nSince then, many [[mathematician]]s, including [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], have worked on both the eight queens puzzle and its generalized ''n''-queens version. In 1874, [[S. Gunther]] proposed a method using [[determinant]]s to find solutions.<ref name=\"rouse_ball_1960\"/> [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|J.W.L. Glaisher]] refined Gunther's approach.\n\nIn 1972, [[Edsger Dijkstra]] used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called [[structured programming]]. He published a highly detailed description of a [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] [[Backtracking|backtracking algorithm]].<sup>[[#References|2]]</sup>\n\n== Constructing and counting solutions ==\nThe problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (''i.e.'', [[Combination|<sub>64</sub>C<sub>8</sub>]]) possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8\u00d78 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids [[Brute-force search|brute-force computational techniques]]. For example, by applying a simple rule that constrains each queen to a single column (or row), though still considered brute force, it is possible to reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 8<sup>8</sup>) possible combinations. Generating [[permutation]]s further reduces the possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, [[factorial|8!]]), which are then checked for diagonal attacks.\n\n[[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]] published a program to count solutions to the n-queens problem using [[bitwise operation]]s.<ref>Martin Richards. Backtracking Algorithms in MCPL using Bit Patterns and Recursion. University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/backtrk.pdf</ref>. However, this solution has already been published by Zongyan Qiu<ref name=\"Qiu paper\">{{cite journal|last1=Qiu|first1=Zongyan|title=Bit-vector encoding of n-queen problem|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|date=February 2002|volume=37|issue=2|page=68-70|doi=10.1145/568600.568613}}</ref>.\n\n=== Solutions ===\nThe eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by the [[symmetry]] operations of rotation and reflection of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions.  These are called ''fundamental'' solutions; representatives of each are shown below.\n\nA fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270\u00b0 and then reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, should a solution be equivalent to its own 90\u00b0 rotation (as happens to one solution with five queens on a 5\u00d75 board), that fundamental solution will have only two variants (itself and its reflection). Should a solution be equivalent to its own 180\u00b0 rotation (but not to its 90\u00b0 rotation), it will have four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90\u00b0 rotation and the reflection of that). If ''n'' > 1, it is not possible for a solution to be equivalent to its own reflection because that would require two queens to be facing each other.  Of the 12 fundamental solutions to the problem with eight queens on an 8\u00d78 board, exactly one (solution 12 below) is equal to its own 180\u00b0 rotation, and none is equal to its 90\u00b0 rotation; thus, the number of distinct solutions is 11\u00d78 + 1\u00d74 = 92 (where the 8 is derived from four 90\u00b0 rotational positions and their reflections, and the 4 is derived from two 180\u00b0 rotational positions and their reflections).\n\nAll fundamental solutions are presented below:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|Solution 1\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 2\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 3\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 4\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 5\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 6\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 7\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 8\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 9\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 10\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 11\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__\n|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql|__\n|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|ql\n|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|ql|__|__|__\n|__|__|ql|__|__|__|__|__\n|Solution 12\n}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\nSolution 10 has the additional property that [[No-three-in-line problem|no three queens are in a straight line]].\n\n==Existence of solutions==\n\nThese brute-force algorithms to count the number of solutions are computationally manageable for n&nbsp;=&nbsp;8, but would be intractable for problems of n&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;20, as 20! = 2.433 \u00d7 10<sup>18</sup>.

[[Fairy chess piece]]s have also been substituted for queens.  In the case of knights, an easy solution is to place one on each square of a given color, since they move only to the opposite color. The solution is also easy for rooks and kings. Eight rooks can be placed along a long diagonal (amongst thousands of other solutions), and 16 kings are placed on the board by dividing it into 2 by 2 squares and placing the kings at equivalent points on each square.\n*[[Permutation matrix]]\n:In mathematics, a permutation matrix can be regarded geometrically as a set of ''n'' points lying on the squares of a ''n''x''n'' chessboard, such that each row or column contains only one point. Thus, an order-''n'' permutation matrix is a solution to an ''n''-rooks puzzle.\n*Nonstandard boards\n:[[George P\u00f3lya|P\u00f3lya]] studied the ''n'' queens problem on a [[torus|toroidal]] (\"donut-shaped\") board and showed that there is a solution on an n\u00d7n board if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3.<ref>G.

The matrix has ''n''<sup>2</sup> rows: one for each possible queen placement, and each row has a 1 in the columns corresponding to that square's rank, file, and diagonals and a 0 in all the other columns.  Then the ''n'' queens problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of the rows of this matrix such that every primary column has a 1 in precisely one of the chosen rows and every secondary column has a 1 in at most one of the chosen rows; this is an example of a generalized [[exact cover]] problem, of which [[sudoku]] is another example.\n* ''n''-Queens Completion\n:A 2017 paper<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Gent\n | first = Ian P.\n | last2 = Jefferson\n | first2 = Christopher\n | last3 = Nightingale\n | first3 = Peter\n | title = Complexity of ''n''-Queens Completion\n | journal = [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]\n | volume = 59\n | pages = 815-848\n | publisher = [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence | AAAI Press]]\n | date = August 2017\n | language = English\n | url = http://jair.org/papers/paper5512.html\n | jstor =\n | issn = 1076 - 9757\n | doi = 10.1613/jair.5512\n | access-date = September 7, 2017}}</ref> investigated the problem \u201cGiven an ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' chessboard on which some queens are already placed, can you place a queen in every remaining row so that no two queens attack each other?\u201d and several related problems.

For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as [[constraint programming]], [[logic programming]] or [[genetic algorithm]]s. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a [[recursion|recursive]] [[algorithm]], by phrasing the ''n'' queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing ''n''&minus;1 queens on an n-by-n chessboard. The [[mathematical induction|induction]] bottoms out with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard.\n\nThis technique is much more efficient than the na\u00efve [[brute-force search]] algorithm, which considers all 64<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!&nbsp;= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results over and over again in all the different [[permutation]]s of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations over and over again for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 8<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;= 16,777,216 blind placements.\n\nIt is possible to do much better than this.\nOne algorithm solves the eight [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] puzzle by generating the permutations of the numbers 1 through 8 (of which there are 8! = 40,320), and uses the elements of each permutation as indices to place a queen on each row.\nThen it rejects those boards with diagonal attacking positions.\nThe [[backtracking]] [[depth-first search]] program, a slight improvement on the permutation method, constructs the [[search tree]] by considering one row of the board at a time, eliminating most nonsolution board positions at a very early stage in their construction.\nBecause it rejects rook and diagonal attacks even on incomplete boards, it examines only 15,720 possible queen placements.\nA further improvement, which examines only 5,508 possible queen\nplacements, is to combine the permutation based method with the early\npruning method: the permutations are generated depth-first, and\nthe search space is pruned if the [[partial permutation]] produces a\ndiagonal attack.\n[[Constraint programming]] can also be very effective on this problem.\n\n[[File:8queensminconflict.gif|thumbnail|right|[[Min-conflicts algorithm|min-conflicts]] solution to 8 queens]]\nAn alternative to exhaustive search is an 'iterative repair' algorithm, which typically starts with all queens on the board, for example with one queen per column.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=4DC9292839FE7B1AFABA1EDB8183242C?doi=10.1.1.57.4685&rep=rep1&type=pdf A Polynomial Time Algorithm for the N-Queen Problem] by Rok Sosic and Jun Gu, 1990.  Describes run time for up to 500,000 Queens which was the max they could run due to memory constraints.</ref> It then counts the number of conflicts (attacks), and uses a heuristic to determine how to improve the placement of the queens. The '[[Min-conflicts algorithm|minimum-conflicts]]' [[heuristic]] &mdash; moving the piece with the largest number of conflicts to the square in the same column where the number of conflicts is smallest &mdash; is particularly effective: it finds a solution to the 1,000,000 queen problem in less than 50 steps on average. This assumes that the initial configuration is 'reasonably good' &mdash; if a million queens all start in the same row, it will take at least 999,999 steps to fix it. A 'reasonably good' starting point can for instance be found by putting each queen in its own row and column so that it conflicts with the smallest number of queens already on the board.\n\nUnlike the backtracking search outlined above, iterative repair does not guarantee a solution: like all [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] procedures, it may get stuck on a local optimum.  (In such a case, the algorithm may be restarted with a different initial configuration.) On the other hand, it can solve problem sizes that are several orders of magnitude beyond the scope of a depth-first search.\n\n[[Image:Eight-queens-animation.gif]]\n\nThis animation illustrates [[backtracking]] to solve the problem. A queen is placed in a column that is known not to cause conflict. If a column is not found the program returns to the last good state and then tries a different column.\n\n==Sample program==\nThe following is a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]  program by [[Niklaus Wirth]] in 1976.<ref>Wirth, 1976, p. 145</ref> It finds one solution to the eight queens problem.\n\n<source lang=\"pascal\">program eightqueen1(output);\n \nvar i : integer; q : boolean;\n    a : array[ 1 .. 8] of boolean;\n    b : array[ 2 .. 16] of boolean;\n    c : array[ -7 .. 7] of boolean;\n    x : array[ 1 .. 8] of integer;\n \nprocedure try( i : integer; var q : boolean);\n    var j : integer;\n    begin \n    j := 0;\n    repeat \n        j := j + 1; \n        q := false;\n        if a[ j] and b[ i + j] and c[ i - j] then\n            begin \n            x[ i    ] := j;\n            a[ j    ] := false; \n            b[ i + j] := false; \n            c[ i - j] := false;\n            if i < 8 then\n                begin\n                try( i + 1, q);\n                if not q then\n                    begin \n                    a[ j] := true; \n                    b[ i + j] := true; \n                    c[ i - j] := true;\n                    end\n                end \n            else \n                q := true\n            end\n    until q or (j = 8);\n    end;\n \nbegin\nfor i :=  1 to  8 do a[ i] := true;\nfor i :=  2 to 16 do b[ i] := true;\nfor i := -7 to  7 do c[ i] := true;\ntry( 1, q);\nif q then\n    for i := 1 to 8 do write( x[ i]:4);\nwriteln\nend.</source>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mathematical game]]\n* [[Mathematical puzzle]]\n* [[No-three-in-line problem]]\n* [[Rook polynomial]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Bell |first1=Jordan |last2=Stevens |first2=Brett\n  |title=A survey of known results and research areas for '''n'''-queens\n   |journal=Discrete Mathematics|volume=309 |number=1|year=2009|pages=1\u201331|doi=10.1016/j.disc.2007.12.043}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Watkins|first1=John J. |year=2004 | title=Across the Board: The Mathematics of Chess Problems\n   |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11503-6}}\n* [[Ole-Johan Dahl|O.-J.

However, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines: \n:\"[Eos addresses Zeus :] \u2018Least I may be of all the goddesses the golden heavens hold--in all the world my shrines are rarest.\u2019\"<ref>Ovid, Metamorphoses 13. 576 ff (trans.

Her brother was the Sun god [[Helios]], and her sister was [[Selene]], the Moon goddess. Her team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the Odyssey as \"Firebright\" and \"Daybright\".\n\nShe was the Mother of several notable offspring, including the Winds, Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus, and the Morning Star, Eosphoros, all of whom she bore to the Titan Astraeus (\"of the Stars\"), and Memnon, her son by Tithonus.\n\nThis rosy-fingered, saffron-robed and golden-throned goddess, who goes up to Olympus to announce the light to the immortals, fell in love several times, and some say it was Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love, because once had Eos lain with Aphrodite's sweetheart Ares, the god of war.\n\n==Genealogy==\nEos is the daughter of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]] and sister of [[Helios]] the sun and [[Selene]] the moon, \"who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven\" [[Hesiod]] told in ''[[Theogony]]'' (371-374).

It is located in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] about {{convert|50|km|-1}} east of the French island of [[Corsica]].\n\nThe island is part of the [[province of Livorno]] and is divided into seven municipalities, with a total population of about 30,000 inhabitants which increases considerably during the summer. The municipalities are [[Portoferraio]] (which is also the island's principal town), [[Campo nell'Elba]], [[Capoliveri]], [[Marciana]], [[Marciana Marina]], [[Porto Azzurro]], and [[Rio, Italy|Rio]].\n\n==Geology==\nElba is the largest remaining stretch of land from the ancient tract that once connected the Italian peninsula to Corsica. The northern coast faces the Ligurian Sea, the eastern coast the Piombino Channel, the southern coast the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Corsica Channel divides the western tip of the island from neighbouring Corsica.\n\nThe island itself is made up of slices of rocks which once formed part of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] seafloor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0040195198000602/1-s2.0-S0040195198000602-main.pdf?_tid=d4a63926-8aeb-11e4-a93e-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1419370801_078832222f5c9eb412283112afb4aff8|title=The association of continental crust rocks with ophiolites in the Northern Apennines (Italy): implications for the continent-ocean transition in the Western Tethys|work=els-cdn.com}}</ref> These rocks have been through at least two [[Orogeny|orogenies]], the [[Alpine orogeny]] and the [[Apennine mountains|Apennine orogeny]].  The second of these two events was associated with subduction of the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] oceanic crust underneath [[Italy]] and the obduction of parts of the ancient seafloor onto the continents.  Later extension within the stretched inner part of the [[Apennine mountains]] caused adiabatic melting and the intrusion of the [[Mount Capanne]] and the La Serra-Porto Azzuro granitoids.  These igneous bodies brought with them [[skarn]] fluids which dissolved and replaced some of the carbonate units, precipitating [[iron]]-rich minerals in their place.  One of the [[iron]]-rich minerals, [[ilvaite]], was first identified on the island and takes its name from the [[Latin]] word for Elba.  More recently, high-angle faults formed within the tectonic pile, allowing for the migration of [[iron]]-rich fluids through the crust.  The deposits left behind by these fluids formed the island's rich seams of [[iron ore]].\n\nThe terrain is quite varied, and is thus divided into several areas based on [[geomorphology]]. The mountainous and most recent part of the island can be found to the west, the centre of which is dominated by [[Mount Capanne]] ({{convert|1018|m|ft|disp=x|/}}), also called the \"roof of the Tuscan Archipelago\". The mountain is home to many animal species including the [[mouflon]] and [[wild boar]], two species that flourish despite the continuous influx of tourists. The central part of the island is a mostly flat section with the width being reduced to just four kilometres ({{convert|4|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}). It is where the major centres can be found: Portoferraio, Campo nell'Elba. To the east is the oldest part of the island, formed over 3 million years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ofioliti.it/index.php/ofioliti/article/view/137/137|title=Login|website=ofioliti.it}}</ref> In the hilly area, dominated by Monte Calamita, are the deposits of [[iron]] that made Elba famous.\n\n===Hydrography===\nRivers rarely exceed {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=off}} in length, and it is common for the shorter ones to dry up during the summer. The largest rivers, sorted by length, are:\n* Fosso San Francesco {{convert|6.5|km}};\n* Fosso Barion, {{convert|5.1|km}};\n* Fosso Redinoce, {{convert|2|km}}\n\nBetween Poggio and Marciana, at the foot of Mount Capanne, is a spring called Fonte Napoleone, known for its quality.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of the island is predominantly Mediterranean, except for Mount Capanne, where winters tend to be moderately cold. Precipitation is concentrated in autumn and comprises a normal rainfall. The island lies in the [[rain shadow]] of the large and mountainous island of Corsica, so precipitation totals are somewhat reduced from the mainland (most of the island receives less than 750&nbsp;mm (30 inches) annually). Snowfall in winter is rare in the lowlands, and melts quickly.

It was well known from very ancient times for its [[iron]] resources and its valued mines. The [[Greeks]] called it '''Aethalia''' (\u0391\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, \"fume\") after the fumes of the furnaces for the production of metal. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] mentions it in his epic poem [[Argonautica]], describing that the [[Argonauts]] rested here during their travels. He writes that signs of their visit were still visible in his day, including skin-coloured pebbles that they dried their hands on and large stones which they used at discus. [[Strabo]] (5.2.6) presents a slightly different account: \"because the scrapings, which the Argonauts formed when they used their [[strigils]], became congealed, the pebbles on the shore remain variegated still to this day.\"<ref>Race, W. H.

In the [[middle ages]], it was invaded by the Ostrogoths and the [[Lombards]], and then it became a possession of the [[Republic of Pisa]]. After the [[battle of Meloria]], the [[Republic of Genova]] took possession of Elba, but it was regained by Pisa in 1292.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elbaworld.com/en/elba-island/p-332-elba-history.htmlHistory|title=of Elba Island|publisher=}}</ref> The island was retained for two centuries by the [[Appiani family]], Lords of [[Piombino]] when they sold Pisa to the [[house of Visconti]] of Milan in 1399.\n\nIn 1544, the [[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa devastated Elba and the coasts of Tuscany.<ref>David, Robert C.

In 1596, [[Philip II of Spain]] captured Porto Azzurro and had two fortresses built there. A part of Elba came into the power of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] through the [[State of the Presidi]], including [[Porto Longone]]. In 1736, the whole of Elba with the [[principality of Piombino]] passed under the jurisdiction of Kingdom of Naples.\n\nThe British landed on the Island of Elba in 1796, after the occupation of [[Livorno]] by the [[First French Republic|French Republican]] troops, to protect the 4,000 French royalists who had found asylum in Portoferraio two years earlier. In 1801, the [[Peace of Luneville]] gave Elba to the [[Kingdom of Etruria]], and it was transferred to France in 1802 by the [[Peace of Amiens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05371c.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Elba|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elbaworld.com/en/elba-island/p-332-elba-history.html|title=History of Elba Island|website=Elbaworld.com}}</ref> French Emperor [[Napoleon]] was exiled to Elba after his forced abdication following the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)]], and he arrived at Portoferraio on 30 May 1814. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of 600 men. He was nominally [[Principality of Elba|sovereign of Elba]], although the nearby sea was patrolled by the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Royal Navy|British navies]]. During the months that Napoleon stayed on the island, he carried out a series of economic and social reforms to improve the quality of life. He stayed on Elba for 300 days, then escaped to France on 26 February 1815. \n\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Elba was restored to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. In 1860, it became part of the new unified [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]]. The island was liberated from the Germans by the French ''[[I Corps (France)#Elba 1944|1<sup>er</sup> Corps d'Arm\u00e9e]]'' on 17 June 1944 in ''[[Invasion of Elba|Op\u00e9ration Brassard]]''.

He was later known as '''Ea''' in Akkadian and [[Babylonian mythology]]. He was originally patron god of the city of [[Eridu]], but later the influence of his cult spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and to the [[Canaanites]], [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]]. He was associated with the southern band of constellations called ''stars of Ea'', but also with the constellation '''A\u0160-IKU''', ''the Field'' ([[Pegasus (constellation)|Square of Pegasus]]).<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JBAA..108....9R Origins of the ancient constellations: I.

He is mentioned in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.\n\nThe exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is \"Lord of the Earth\". The Sumerian ''[[EN (cuneiform)|En]]'' is translated as a title equivalent to \"[[lord]]\" and was originally a title given to the High Priest. ''Ki'' means \"earth\", but there are theories that ''ki'' in this name has another origin, possibly ''kig'' of unknown meaning, or ''kur'' meaning \"mound\".\nThe name Ea is allegedly [[Hurrian]] in origin while others <ref>Huffmon, Herbert B.

(Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins Press)</ref><ref>Noah Kramer, Samuel and John Maier, (1989), \"Myths of Enki, the Crafty God\" (New York and Oxford. Oxford University Press)</ref> claim that his name 'Ea' is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning \"life\" in this case used for \"spring\", \"running water\". In Sumerian E-A means \"the house of water\", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the god at [[Eridu]]. It has also been suggested that the original non-anthropomorphic divinity at Eridu was not Enki but [[Abzu]]. The emergence of Enki as the divine lover of [[Ninhursag]], and the divine battle between the younger Igigi divinities and Abzu, saw the Abzu, the underground waters of the Aquifer, becoming the place in which the foundations of the temple were built.<ref>Espak, Peter (2006) \"Enki and Ea\" (thesis) p.20</ref> With some Sumerian deity names as Enlil there are variations like Elil. En means \"Lord\" and E means \"temple\". It is likely that E-A is the Sumerian short form for \"Lord of Water\", as Enki is a god of water. Ab in Abzu also means water.\n\n==Worship==\nThe main temple to Enki was called ''E-abzu'', meaning \"[[abzu]] temple\" (also ''E-en-gur-a'', meaning \"house of the subterranean waters\"), a [[ziggurat]] temple surrounded by [[Euphrates|Euphratean]] marshlands near the ancient [[Persian Gulf]] coastline at [[Eridu]]. It was the first temple known to have been built in Southern Iraq.  Four separate excavations at the site of [[Eridu]] have demonstrated the existence of a shrine dating back to the earliest [[Ubaid period]], more than 6,500 years ago.  Over the following 4,500 years, the temple was expanded 18 times, until it was abandoned during the Persian period.<ref>file:/-Enki-Ea-Peeter-Espak.pdf accessed 31/08/2014</ref>  On this basis Thorkild Jacobsen<ref>Jacobsen, Thorkild \"Mesopotamian Gods and Pantheons\", p.22</ref> has hypothesized that the original deity of the temple was Abzu, with his attributes later being taken by Enki over time. P. Steinkeller believes that, during the earliest period, Enki had a subordinate position to a goddess (possibly [[Ninhursag]]), taking the role of divine consort or high priest,<ref>Steinkeller P. (1999) \"Priests and Officials\", p.129</ref> later taking priority. The Enki temple had at its entrance a pool of fresh water, and excavation has found numerous carp bones, suggesting collective feasts. Carp are shown in the twin water flows running into the later God Enki, suggesting continuity of these features over a very long period.  These features were found at all subsequent Sumerian temples, suggesting that this temple established the pattern for all subsequent Sumerian temples. \"All rules laid down at Eridu were faithfully observed\".<ref>van Buren, E.D.

In the later Babylonian epic ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', Abzu, the \"begetter of the gods\", is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu \"casting him into a deep sleep\", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home \"''in the depths of the Abzu''.\" Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of [[semen]].<ref>Leick, Gwendolyn (2001), \"Mesopotamia: the invention of the city\" (Penguin) p.20</ref>\n\nEarly royal inscriptions from the [[third millennium BCE]] mention \"the reeds of Enki\". [[Phragmites|Reed]]s were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the ''[[Kur]]'' or [[underworld]] of [[Sumerian mythology]]. In another even older tradition, [[Nammu]], the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having ''\"given birth to the great gods,\"'' was the mother of Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki.<ref>Dalley, S (1989), \"Myths of Mesopotamia\" (Oxford, NY), p.50</ref> Benito states \"With Enki it is an interesting change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian ''\"a\"'' or ''\"Ab\"'' which also means \"semen\". In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands at the empty riverbeds and fills them with his 'water'\".<ref>Benito, C.A. (1969) \"Enki and Ninmah\" and \"Enki and the World Order\" (dissertation, Uni of Philadelphia)</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Enki and Ninhursag and the Creation of Life and Sickness===\nThe cosmogenic myth common in Sumer was that of the [[hieros gamos]], a sacred marriage where divine principles in the form of dualistic opposites came together as male and female to give birth to the cosmos. In the epic ''Enki and Ninhursag'', Enki, as lord of ''Ab'' or fresh water (also the Sumerian word for semen), is living with his wife in the paradise of [[Dilmun]] where\n\n::The land of Dilmun is a pure place, the land of Dilmun is a clean place,\n::The land of Dilmun is a clean place, the land of Dilmun is a bright place;\n::He who is alone laid himself down in Dilmun,\n::The place, after Enki is clean, that place is bright\n\nDespite being a place where ''\"the raven uttered no cries\"'' and ''\"the lion killed not, the wolf snatched not the lamb, unknown was the kid-killing dog, unknown was the grain devouring boar\"'', Dilmun had no water and Enki heard the cries of its Goddess, Ninsikil, and orders the sun-God Utu to bring fresh water from the Earth for Dilmun. As a result,\n\n::''\"Her City Drinks the Water of Abundance,\n::''Dilmun Drinks the Water of Abundance,\n::''Her wells of bitter water, behold they are become wells of good water,\n::''Her fields and farms produced crops and grain,\n::''Her city, behold it has become the house of the banks and quays of the land.''\"\n\nDilmun was identified with [[Bahrain]], whose name in [[Arabic]] means ''\"two seas\"'', where the fresh waters of the Arabian [[aquifer]] mingle with the salt waters of the [[Persian Gulf]]. This mingling of waters was known in Sumerian as [[Nammu]], and was identified as the mother of Enki.\n\nThe subsequent tale, with similarities to the Biblical story of the forbidden fruit, repeats the story of how fresh water brings life to a barren land.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Enki, the Water-Lord then ''\"caused to flow the 'water of the heart\"'' and having fertilised his consort [[Ninhursag]], also known as [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] or Earth, after ''\"Nine days being her nine months, the months of 'womanhood'... like good butter, Nintu, the mother of the land, ...like good butter, gave birth to [[Ninsar]], (Lady Greenery)\"''. When Ninhursag left him, as Water-Lord he came upon Ninsar (Lady Greenery). Not knowing her to be his daughter, and because she reminds him of his absent consort, Enki then seduces and has intercourse with her. Ninsar then gave birth to [[Ninkurra]] (Lady Fruitfulness or Lady Pasture), and leaves Enki alone again. A second time, Enki, in his loneliness finds and seduces Ninkurra, and from the union Ninkurra gave birth to [[Uttu]] (weaver or spider, the weaver of the web of life).\n\nA third time Enki succumbs to temptation, and attempts seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki's reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, upset at the promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely to be affected by flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth Ninhursag takes Enki's semen from Uttu's womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward [[Isimud]], ''\"Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, 'What is this (plant), what is this (plant). His messenger Isimud, answers him; 'My king, this is the tree-plant', he says to him. He cuts it off for him and he (Enki) eats it\". And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do, chagrinned they ''\"sit in the dust\"''. As Enki lacks a womb with which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil King of the Gods, ''\"If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?\"'' Ninhursag's sacred fox then fetches the goddess.\n\nNinhursag relents and takes Enki's Ab (water, or semen) into her body, and gives birth to gods of healing of each part of the body. Abu for the Jaw, Nintul for the Hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the Limbs. The last one, [[Ninti]] (Lady Rib), is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.\n\nNinti, the title of Ninhursag, also means ''\"the mother of all living\"'', and was a title given to the later [[Hurrian]] [[goddess]] [[Hebat|Kheba]]. This is also the title given in the Bible to [[Eve]], the Hebrew and Aramaic \u1e24awwah (\u05d7\u05d5\u05d4), who was made from the rib of Adam, in a strange reflection of the Sumerian myth, in which Adam \u2014 not Enki \u2014 walks in the Garden of Paradise.<ref name=kramer1>{{cite book\n| last       = Kramer\n| first      = Samuel Noah \n| authormask = \n| authorlink = Samuel Noah Kramer\n| title         = Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium BC\n| url           = \n| archiveurl    = \n| archivedate   = \n| accessdate    = \n| edition   = \n| series    = \n| volume    = \n| date      = 12 November 2007\n| origyear  = \n| publisher = Forgotten Books\n| location  = [[Charleston, South Carolina]]\n| isbn      = 978-1-60506-049-1\n| page      = \n| pages     = \n| nopp      = \n}}</ref>\n\n===Enki and the Making of Man===\nAfter six generations of gods, in the Babylonian ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', in the seventh generation, (Akkadian ''\"shapattu\"'' or sabath), the younger [[Igigi]] gods, the sons and daughters of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping the creation working. [[Abzu]] God of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the Gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of [[Eridu]]. But the universe is still threatened, as [[Tiamat]], angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier [[Kingu]], decides to take back the creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki who harnessed [[Abzu]], Tiamat's consort, for irrigation refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal [[Enlil]], their father, God of [[Nippur]], promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by [[Marduk]], Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is [[Asshur]]. After dispatching Tiamat with the \"arrows of his winds\" down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of \"who will keep the cosmos working\". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother [[Nammu]] (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) \"brings the tears of the gods\" before Enki and says\n\n{{poemquote|Oh my son, arise from thy bed, from thy (slumber), work what is wise,<br>\nFashion servants for the Gods, may they produce their (bread?).}}\n\nEnki then advises that they create a servant of the gods, humankind, out of clay and blood.<ref>Kramer 1963 pp. 149-151; Kramer 1961 pp. 69-72 Christopher B.

Hooke's ''Middle Eastern Mythology''</ref> Against Enki's wish the Gods decide to slay Kingu, and Enki finally consents to use Kingu's blood to make the first human, with whom Enki always later has a close relationship, the first of the seven sages, seven wise men or ''\"Abgallu\"'' (Ab = water, Gal = great, Lu = Man), also known as [[Adapa]]. Enki assembles a team of divinities to help him, creating a host of \"good and princely fashioners\". He tells his mother\n\n{{poemquote|Oh my mother, the creature whose name thou has uttered, it exists,<br>\nBind upon it the (will?) of the Gods;<br>\nMix the heart of clay that is over the Abyss,<br>\nThe good and princely fashioners will thicken the clay<br>\nThou, do thou bring the limbs into existence;<br>\n[[Ninmah]] (the Earth-mother goddess (Ninhursag, his wife and consort) will work above thee<br>\n([[Nintu]]?)

And Nammu told him that with the help of Enki (her son) she can create humans in the image of gods.\n\n===Confuser of languages===\nIn the Sumerian epic entitled ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'', in a speech of [[Enmerkar]], an incantation is pronounced that has a mythical introduction. Kramer's translation is as follows:<ref>[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1823.htm Another translation] describes 'Hamazi, the many-tongued' and instead calls on Enki to change the languages of mankind into one.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Once upon a time there was no snake, there was no scorpion,<br />\nThere was no hyena, there was no lion,<br />\nThere was no wild dog, no wolf,<br />\nThere was no fear, no terror,<br />\nMan had no rival.\n\nIn those days, the lands of [[Subartu|Subur]] (and) [[Hamazi]],<br />\nHarmony-tongued Sumer, the great land of the decrees of princeship,<br />\nUri, the land having all that is appropriate,<br />\nThe land [[Amorites|Martu]], resting in security,<br />\nThe whole universe, the people in unison<br />\nTo Enlil in one tongue [spoke].\n\n(Then) Enki, the lord of abundance (whose) commands are trustworthy,<br />\nThe lord of wisdom, who understands the land,<br />\nThe leader of the gods,<br />\nEndowed with wisdom, the lord of [[Eridu]]<br />\nChanged the speech in their mouths, [brought] contention into it,<br />\nInto the speech of man that (until then) had been one.}}\n\n===Enki and the Deluge===\n{{Main article|Sumerian creation myth}}\nIn the Sumerian version of the [[flood myth]], the causes of the flood and the reasons for the hero's survival are unknown due to the fact that the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] has stated that it can probably be reasonably inferred that the hero [[Ziusudra]] survives due to Enki's aid because that is what happens in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.:|edition=Revised|date=1961|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8122-1047-6|pages=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\nIn the later Legend of [[Atrahasis]], Enlil, the king of the gods, sets out to eliminate humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods, except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, [[Enlil]] convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell [[humankind]] that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day Deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil is unfair to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This is one of the oldest of the surviving [[Middle East]]ern [[Flood (mythology)|Deluge myths]].\n\n===Enki and Inanna===\n\nThe myth ''Enki and Inanna''<ref>\"Inanna: Lady of Love and War, Queen of Heaven and Earth, Morning and Evening Star\", consulted 25 August 2007 [http://www.gatewaystobabylon.com/gods/ladies/ladyinanna1.html]</ref><ref name=\"gfixkf\">Wolkstein, Diana and Noah Kramer, Samuel \"Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth\"</ref> tells the story of how the young goddess of the [[E-anna|\u00c9-anna]] temple of [[Uruk]] feasts with her father Enki.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Enchlin|first1=Kim|title=Inanna|date=2015|publisher=Penguin|location=Toronto, Canada|page=55}}</ref> The two deities participate in a drinking competition; then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the ''[[Me (mythology)|Mes]]''. The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant [[Isimud]] for the ''Mes'', only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset, he sends [[Gallu|''Galla'']] to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay of Uruk. Eventually, Enki admits his defeat and accepts a peace treaty with Uruk.\n\nPolitically, this myth would seem to indicate events of an early period when political authority passed from Enki's city of Eridu to Inanna's city of Uruk.\n\nIn the myth of ''Inanna's descent'',<ref name=\"gfixkf\"/> Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister [[Ereshkigal]], who is mourning the death of her husband [[Gugalana]] (''gu'', bull, ''gal'', big, ''ana'', sky/heaven), slain by [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Enkidu]], sets out to visit her sister. Inanna tells her servant Ninshubur (''Lady Evening'', a reference to Inanna's role as the [[Venus|evening star]]) to get help from [[Anu]], [[Enlil]] or Enki if she does not return in three days. After Inanna has not come back, Ninshubur approaches Anu, only to be told that he knows the goddess' strength and her ability to take care of herself. While Enlil tells Ninshubur he is busy running the cosmos, Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla (Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails) to recover the young goddess.\nThese beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman ''[[Galli]]'', androgynous beings of the [[Third gender|third sex]], similar to the American Indian [[Two-Spirit|berdache]], who played an important part in early religious ritual.<ref>De Shong Meador, Betty, (2006)\"Inanna: Lady of the Largest Heart: Poems of the Sumerian High Priestess Enheduanna\" (Texas Press)</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Inanna and Shukaletuda}}In the story ''[[Inanna and Shukaletuda]]'',<ref>Lishtar \"The Avenging Maiden and the Predator Gardener: a study of Inanna and Shukaletuda\" [http://www.gatewaystobabylon.com/essays/shukaletuda.html]</ref> [[Shukaletuda]], the gardener, set by Enki to care for the date palm he had created, finds Inanna sleeping under the palm tree and rapes the goddess in her sleep. Awaking, she discovers that she has been violated and seeks to punish the miscreant. Shukaletuda seeks protection from Enki, whom Bottero<ref>Bott\u00e9ro, Jean (1992) \"Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods\" (University of Chicago Press)</ref> believes to be his father. In classic Enkian fashion, the father advises Shukaletuda to hide in the city where Inanna will not be able to find him. Enki, as the protector of whoever comes to seek his help, and as the empowerer of Inanna, here challenges the young impetuous goddess to control her anger so as to be better able to function as a great judge.\n\nEventually, after cooling her anger, she too seeks the help of Enki, as spokesperson of the \"assembly of the gods\", the Igigi and the Anunnaki. After she presents her case, Enki sees that justice needs to be done and promises help, delivering knowledge of where the miscreant is hiding.\n\n===Enki and the Kur===\nIn the earliest surviving version of the myth of the slaying of the [[Kur]], Enki is the hero responsible for the Kur being slain. Unfortunately, this myth is highly fragmentary and what little that is known about it comes solely from the prologue at the beginning of the epic poem, \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World.\" In later versions of this myth, the hero is either [[Ninurta]] or Inanna.<ref name=\"Kramer, Samuel Noah 1961\">Kramer, Samuel Noah (1961) ''Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.: Revised Edition'' (University of Pennsylvania press)</ref>\n\nBased on what little has survived of the account, it seems that the legend begins with the Kur abducting the goddess, [[Ereshkigal]], and dragging her down to the Netherworld. Enki sets out in a boat to attack the Kur and avenge the abduction of Ereshkigal. The Kur is described as defending itself using a storm of hailstones of all sizes and by attacking Enki using the waters beneath the boat. The account never actually tells who the winner of the fight is, but it can probably be assumed that Enki is the ultimate victor.<ref name=\"Kramer, Samuel Noah 1961\"/><ref>http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1814.htm</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nEnki and later Ea were apparently depicted, sometimes, as a man covered with the skin of a fish, and this representation, as likewise the name of his temple E-apsu, \"house of the watery deep\", points decidedly to his original character as a god of the waters (see [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]]). Around the excavation of the 18 shrines found on the spot, thousands of [[carp]] bones were found, consumed possibly in feasts to the god. Of his cult at Eridu, which goes back to the oldest period of Mesopotamian history, nothing definite is known except that his temple was also associated with Ninhursag's temple which was called ''Esaggila'', \"the lofty head house\" (''[[\u00c9 (temple)|E]]'', house, ''sag'', head, ''ila'', high; or Akkadian goddess = Ila), a name shared with Marduk's temple in Babylon, pointing to a staged tower or [[ziggurat]] (as with the temple of [[Enlil]] at [[Nippur]], which was known as ''E-kur'' (''kur'', hill)), and that incantations, involving ceremonial rites in which water as a sacred element played a prominent part, formed a feature of his worship. This seems also implicated in the [[epic poetry|epic]] of the [[hieros gamos]] or sacred [[marriage]] of Enki and Ninhursag (above), which seems an [[etiology|etiological]] myth of the fertilisation of the dry ground by the coming of irrigation water (from Sumerian ''a'', ''ab'', water or semen). The early inscriptions of [[Urukagina]] in fact go so far as to suggest that the divine pair, Enki and Ninki, were the progenitors of seven pairs of gods, including Enki as god of [[Eridu]], [[Enlil]] of [[Nippur]], and Su'en (or [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]]) of [[Ur]], and were themselves the children of An (sky, heaven) and Ki (earth).<ref name=\"MastersThesis\">[http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/bitstream/handle/10062/958/espakpeeter.pdf;jsessionid=F71776D1F928C8B023CAFF1BB333185A?sequence=5 Espak, Peeter., ''Ancient Near Eastern Gods Ea and Enki; Diachronical analysis of texts and images from the earliest sources to the neo-sumerian period'', Masters thesis for Tartu University, Faculty of Theology, Chair for Ancient Near Eastern Studies, 2006.]</ref> The pool of the Abzu at the front of his temple was adopted also at the temple to Nanna ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]]) the Moon, at [[Ur]], and spread from there throughout the Middle East. It is believed to remain today as the sacred pool at [[Mosques]], or as the holy water font in Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.<ref>Bottero, Jean (1995), \"Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods\" (University Of Chicago Press)</ref>\n\nWhether Eridu at one time also played an important political role in Sumerian affairs is not certain, though not improbable. At all events the prominence of \"Ea\" led, as in the case of Nippur, to the survival of Eridu as a sacred city, long after it had ceased to have any significance as a political center. Myths in which Ea figures prominently have been found in [[Assurbanipal]]'s library, and in the [[Hattusas]] [[archive]] in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Anatolia]]. As Ea, Enki had a wide influence outside of Sumer, being equated with [[El (god)|El]] (at [[Ugarit]]) and possibly [[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]] (at [[Ebla]]) in the [[Canaanite mythology|Canaanite]] [[Elohim|'ilhm]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], he is also found in [[Hurrian]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] mythology, as a god of contracts, and is particularly favourable to humankind. It has been suggested that etymologiically Ea was comes from the term ''*hyy'' (life), referring to Enki's waters as life giving.<ref name=Opening>{{cite book|author1=Alfonso Archii|editor1-last=Melville|editor1-first=Sarah|editor2-last=Slotsky|editor2-first=Alice|title=Opening the Tablet Box: Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Benjamin R.

He was also the creator and protector of man, and of the world in general. Traces of this version of Ea appear in the Marduk epic celebrating the achievements of this god and the close connection between the Ea cult at Eridu and that of Marduk. The correlation between the two rises from two other important connections: (1) that the name of Marduk's sanctuary at Babylon bears the same name, ''Esaggila'', as that of a temple in Eridu, and (2) that Marduk is generally termed the son of Ea, who derives his powers from the voluntary abdication of the father in favour of his son. Accordingly, the incantations originally composed for the Ea cult were re-edited by the priests of Babylon and adapted to the worship of [[Marduk]], and, similarly, the hymns to Marduk betray traces of the transfer to Marduk of attributes which originally belonged to Ea.\n\nIt is, however, as the third figure in the triad (the two other members of which were [[Anu]] and [[Enlil]]) that Ea acquires his permanent place in the pantheon. To him was assigned the control of the watery element, and in this capacity he becomes the ''[[b\u00ealu|shar]] apsi''; i.e. king of the Apsu or \"the abyss\". The Apsu was figured as the abyss of water beneath the earth, and since the gathering place of the dead, known as Aralu, was situated near the confines of the Apsu, he was also designated as [[EN (cuneiform)|En]][[En-Ki|-Ki]]; i.e. \"lord of that which is below\", in contrast to Anu, who was the lord of the \"above\" or the heavens. The cult of Ea extended throughout Babylonia and [[Assyria]]. We find temples and shrines erected in his honour, e.g. at [[Nippur]], [[Girsu]], [[Ur]], [[Babylon]], [[Sippar]], and [[Nineveh]], and the numerous epithets given to him, as well as the various forms under which the god appears, alike bear witness to the popularity which he enjoyed from the earliest to the latest period of Babylonian-Assyrian history. The consort of Ea, known as Ninhursag, Ki, Uriash [[Damkina]], \"lady of that which is below\", or [[Damgalnunna]], \"big lady of the waters\", originally was fully equal with Ea, but in more [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] Assyrian and [[Neo-Babylonian]] times plays a part merely in association with her lord. Generally, however, Enki seems to be a reflection of pre-patriarchal times, in which relations between the sexes were characterised by a situation of greater [[gender equality]]. In his character, he prefers persuasion to conflict, which he seeks to avoid if possible.\n\n==Ea and West Semitic deities==\nIn 1964, a team of Italian archaeologists under the direction of [[Paolo Matthiae]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] performed a series of excavations of material from the third-millennium BCE city of [[Ebla]]. Much of the written material found in these digs was later translated by [[Giovanni Pettinato]].\n\nAmong other conclusions, he found a tendency among the inhabitants of [[Ebla]], after the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], to replace the name of [[El (god)|El]], king of the gods of the [[Canaanite pantheon]] (found in names such as Mikael and Ishmael), with ''Ia'' (Mikaia, Ishmaia).<ref>Freeman, Tzvi. \"Is there evidence of Abraham's revolution? - The Big Picture\".

Trained in stage acting, which he enjoyed doing most, he became \"one of the greatest '[[character actor]]s' ever to appear on stage and screen\",<ref name=\"TCM\"/> with over 90 film credits. On stage, he often co-starred with his wife, [[Anne Jackson]], becoming one of the best-known acting couples in the American theater.  As a stage and screen character actor, Wallach had one of the longest ever careers in show business, spanning 62 years from his Broadway debut to his last major Hollywood studio movie.\n\nWallach initially studied [[method acting]] under [[Sanford Meisner]], and later became a founding member of the [[Actors Studio]], where he studied under [[Lee Strasberg]]. His versatility gave him the ability to play a wide variety of different roles throughout his career, primarily as a [[supporting actor]].\n\nFor his debut screen performance in ''[[Baby Doll]]'' (1956), he won a [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles|BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination. Among his other most famous roles are Calvera in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960), Guido in ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), and Tuco (\"The Ugly\") in ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).  Other notable portrayals include outlaw Charlie Gant in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), [[Don Altobello]] in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'',  Cotton Weinberger in ''[[The Two Jakes]]'' (both 1990), and Arthur Abbott in ''[[The Holiday]]'' (2006).  One of America's most prolific screen actors, Wallach remained active well into his nineties, with roles as recently as 2010 in ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'' and ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]''.\n\nWallach received [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]], [[Tony Award]]s and [[Emmy Award]]s for his work, and received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] at the second annual [[Governors Awards]], presented on November 13, 2010.\n\nIn March 2017, the [[Harry Ransom Center]] announced the acquisition of Wallach's papers, along with those of his wife.

Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelly notes that while Sinatra's test was good, it had none of the \"consummate acting ability\" of Wallach. Producer [[Harry Cohn]] and director [[Fred Zinnemann]] were \"dazzled\" by Wallach's screen test and wanted him to play the part. However, Wallach had previously been offered an important role in another [[Tennessee Williams]] play, ''[[Camino Real (play)|Camino Real]]'', to be directed by [[Elia Kazan]], and turned down the movie role. Wallach said that when he learned that the play had finally received financing, he \"grabbed\" the opportunity: \"It was a remarkable piece of writing by the leading playwright in America and it was going to be directed by the country's best.

Their music is characterised by a fusion of [[Beatlesque]] [[pop music|pop]], [[classical music|classical]] [[arrangement]]s, and [[Future#Science fiction|futuristic iconography]].<ref name=AllMusicBio/> After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist [[Richard Tandy]] were the group's only consistent members.\n\nELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, [[the Move]], of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including two LPs that reached the top of British charts: the [[disco]]-inspired ''[[Discovery (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Discovery]]'' (1979) and the [[science-fiction]]-themed [[concept album]] ''[[Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Time]]'' (1981). In 1986, Lynne lost interest in the band and ceased its operation. Bevan responded by forming his own band, [[ELO Part II]], which later became [[The Orchestra (band)|the Orchestra]]. With the exception of a short-lived reunion in 2000\u201301, ELO remained largely inactive until the 2010s. In 2014, Lynne re-formed the band again with Tandy as '''Jeff Lynne's ELO''', where he resumed concert touring and new recordings under the moniker.\n\nDuring ELO's original 14-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elo.biz/bandhistory.html |title=Electric Light Orchestra \u2013 Band History |publisher=Elo.biz |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511065413/http://www.elo.biz/bandhistory.html |archivedate=11 May 2010|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> collecting 19 [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|CRIA]], 21 [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and 38 [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/index.php |title=RIAA |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004174019/http://www.riaa.com/index.php |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> For a period in the mid 1970s, the band saw more success in the United States, where they were billed as \"the English guys with the big fiddles\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |title=Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |accessdate=27 July 2007 |work=Dutch Progressive Rock Page|author=Rob Michel}}</ref> From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated twenty Top 20 songs on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In January 1970, when [[Carl Wayne]] left the Move, Lynne accepted Wood's second invitation to join the band on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project. On 12 July 1970, when Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and \"[[10538 Overture]]\" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. To help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album ''[[Message from the Country]]'' was also recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings. The resulting debut album ''[[The Electric Light Orchestra (album)|The Electric Light Orchestra]]'' was released in 1971. It was released in the United States in 1972 as ''No Answer'', the name being chosen because a record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company and get the name of the album\u2014since they were unable to contact them they left a note saying \"No Answer\".<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/noanswer.asp Electric Light Orchestra's No Answer]. snopes.com.

Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits [[Mike de Albuquerque]] and [[Colin Walker (cellist)|Colin Walker]] joining the band on bass and cello respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy3.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/epm/7973?q=colin+walker+elo&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=Electric Light Orchestra|last=Larkin|first=Colin|date=20 July 2016|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe new line-up performed at the 1972 [[Reading Festival]]. Barcus Berry instrument [[Pickup (music technology)|pick-ups]], now sported by the band's string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by all the sound of the electrified instruments. The band released their second album, ''[[ELO 2]]'' in 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the [[Chuck Berry]] classic \"[[Roll Over Beethoven]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\" /> ELO also made their first appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' show. During the recording of the third album, Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, [[Mik Kaminski]] joined as violinist and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much. Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, ''[[On the Third Day]]'', was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single \"[[Showdown (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Showdown]]\".

Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne. Following the release of ''Eldorado'' [[Kelly Groucutt]] was recruited as bassist, and in early 1975 [[Melvyn Gale]] replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and regularly appeared on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' (1973, 1975, 1976 & 1977) more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances.\n\n''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face the Music]]'' was released in 1975, producing the hit singles \"[[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]]\", their third UK top 10, and \"[[Strange Magic]]\".<ref name=\"UK Charts\"/> The opening instrumental \"[[Fire on High]]\", with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television program ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'' in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.\n\n{{listen\n|filename= Electric Light Orchestra - Livin' Thing.ogg\n|title= \"Livin' Thing\" from ''A New World Record'' (1976)\n|description=\"[[Livin' Thing]]\" was a Top 10 hit for the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at number four.\n|pos=right}}\n\n[[File:Electric Light Orchestra (logo - 1976).png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Revised logo designed in 1976 by artist [[John Kosh|Kosh]].

During 1979 Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 [[Knebworth Festival]] concerts. That allowed [[Led Zeppelin]] the chance to headline instead. In 1980 Jeff Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', with the other half written by [[John Farrar]] and performed by the film's star [[Olivia Newton-John]]. The movie performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]]. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John (\"[[Magic (Olivia Newton-John song)|Magic]]\", a #1 hit in the United States, and \"[[Suddenly (Olivia Newton-John and Cliff Richard song)|Suddenly]]\" with [[Cliff Richard]]) and ELO (\"[[I'm Alive (Electric Light Orchestra song)|I'm Alive]]\", which went gold, \"[[All Over the World (ELO song)|All Over the World]]\" and \"[[Don't Walk Away (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Don't Walk Away]]\"). The title track, performed by both Newton-John and ELO, is ELO's only song to top the singles chart in the United Kingdom.<ref>Guinness World Records: \"British Hit Singles 14th Edition\", page 195. 0-85112-156-X</ref> More than a quarter of a century later, ''[[Xanadu (musical)|Xanadu]]'', a Broadway musical, based on the film, opened on 10 July 2007 at the Helen Hayes Theatre to uniformly good reviews.

With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. ''Time'' topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until ''Alone in the Universe'' in 2015. Singles from the album included \"[[Hold On Tight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Hold On Tight]]\", \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", \"[[The Way Life's Meant to Be]]\", \"[[Here Is the News]]\" and \"[[Ticket to the Moon]]\". The band embarked on [[Time Tour|their last world tour]] to promote the LP. For the tour Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst synthesiser players Louis Clark and Dave Morgan also joined the band.\n\n===1983\u20131986: ''Secret Messages'', ''Balance of Power'', disbanding===\n[[File:Electric Light Orchestra (1986).jpg|thumb|right|ELO performing in 1986 (Lynne and Tandy pictured)]]\n\nJeff Lynne wanted to follow ''Time'' with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive in the oil crisis and as a result, the new album was edited down from double album to a single disc and released as ''[[Secret Messages]]'' in 1983 (many of the out-takes were later released on ''[[Afterglow (box set)|Afterglow]]'' or as b-sides of singles). The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5; but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP, as drummer Bevan was now playing drums for [[Black Sabbath]] and bassist Groucutt had left the band during the recording of the album (leaving Lynne to once again record many of the bass parts). Rumours of the group disbanding were publicly denied by Bevan and although ''Secret Messages'' debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it fell off the charts, failing to catch fire with a lack of hit singles in the UK (though \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Is King]]\" was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response. By 1983 Bevan was expressing a desire to join [[Black Sabbath]] permanently and Lynne and Tandy were recording tracks for the ''[[Electric Dreams (soundtrack)|Electric Dreams]]'' soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record ''[[Balance of Power (album)|Balance of Power]]'', released early in 1986. Though the single \"[[Calling America]]\" placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the [[United States|States]], subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesisers, played by Tandy.\n\nThe band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark, and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on ''[[American Bandstand]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erY78_dwlH0|title=ELO  -  Calling Am\u00e9rica  AB  5 Jul 1986|date=31 May 2011|work=YouTube}}</ref> ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', then at [[Disneyland]] that summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9s5RZFJgE|title=ELO - Disney's Summer Vacation Party (TV Show - 1986)|date=17 October 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref> The [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]] was a charity concert organised by Bevan in ELO's hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNzKdM99Jo|title=Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) Concert at Birmingham NEC 1986 - Heartbeat 86|date=28 May 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref> A hint of Lynne's future was seen when [[George Harrison]] appeared onstage during the encore at Heartbeat, joining in the all-star jam of \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\". ELO's last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany playing as opening act to [[Rod Stewart]]. ELO effectively disbanded after that final show in Stuttgart in 1986, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison's Lynne-produced album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' and the pair's follow-up (with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Petty]] as [[Traveling Wilburys]]) ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' were released.\n\n;ELO Part II\n{{Main|ELO Part II}}\n[[File:Electric Light Orchestra 3.jpg|right|thumb|ELO Part II in concert]]\n\nBevan (under an agreement with Lynne who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as [[ELO Part II]], initially with no other former ELO members. ELO Part II released their debut album ''[[Electric Light Orchestra Part Two (album)|Electric Light Orchestra Part Two]]'' in 1990. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell joined the band for the first tour in 1991. McDowell left after that tour. Bevan, Groucutt, Kaminski and Clark recorded a second album, ''[[Moment of Truth (ELO Part II album)|Moment of Truth]]'', in 1994 and toured extensively until 1999. Bevan retired from the line-up in 1999 and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000.\n\n===2000\u20132001: Reformation===\nLynne's comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, ''[[Flashback (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Flashback]]'', containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO's only UK number one hit \"[[Xanadu (Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra song)|Xanadu]]\". In 2001 ''[[Zoom (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Zoom]],'' ELO's first album since 1986, was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zoom-mw0000110819/releases|title=Zoom|work=AllMusic}}</ref> Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[Ringo Starr]] and [[George Harrison]]. Upon completion of the album, Lynne reformed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend [[Rosie Vela]] (who had released her own album, ''Zazu'', in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Former ELO member Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' and a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] concert shot at [[CBS Television City]], later titled ''[[Zoom Tour Live]]'', that was released on DVD.

The film was written by Raimi and [[Scott Spiegel]], produced by [[Robert Tapert]], and stars [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]].\n\nFilming took place in Michigan and North Carolina in 1986, and the film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987. It was a minor box office success, achieving just under $6 million. It garnered positive reviews in which critics praised Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance. Like the original, ''Evil Dead II'' has accumulated a [[Cult film|cult following]]. The film was followed by a third installment, ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', in 1992 and a television series, ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'', in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a brief (and altered/reimagined/truncated) recap of the first movie. [[Ash Williams]] and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of [[archaeologist]] Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Book of the Dead, ''[[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]]'', which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a \"[[deadite]]\". Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel and bury her near the cabin.\n\nAt dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. Ash briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the force is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash attempts to flee the area, but finds that the bridge leading to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases Ash back to the cabin where Linda's revived head attacks him, biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless deadite Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Then Ash's possessed right hand tries to kill him, and Ash is forced to sever his hand with his chainsaw. Ash then attempts to shoot the severed hand hiding in the wall of the cabin. The hand mocks him and ultimately gets away. \n\nMeanwhile, Knowby's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of locals Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane by the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life with objects in the room laughing hysterically at him.\n\nThe four new arrivals meet Ash at the cabin and listen to a recording of Knowby detailing how his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, forcing him to kill her. They find Mrs. Knowby, now a deadite, in the cabin's root cellar, and it attacks and possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe tries to escape but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. Annie translates two of the pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, holding them at gunpoint to force them to go look for Bobby Joe. Ash is possessed once again and turns on his remaining companions, incapacitating Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) and drags him to the cellar door, where he is killed by Henrietta in a gory bloodbath. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self when he sees his girlfriend Linda's necklace.\n\nAsh, with Annie's help, modifies the chainsaw and attaches it to his stump, where his right hand had been. Ash eventually finds the missing pages of the ''Necronomicon'' and kills Henrietta, who has turned into a long-necked monster. After Ash kills Henrietta, Annie chants an incantation that sends the Kandarian Demon back to its origin. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex/portal which not only draws in the demon, but nearby trees, Ash's [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and Ash himself. Meanwhile, Ash's severed [[Alien hand syndrome|possessed hand]] stabs Annie.\n\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the year 1300 AD. He is then confronted by a group of knights who initially mistake him for a deadite, but they are quickly distracted when a real one shows up. Ash blasts the harpy-like deadite with his shotgun and is hailed as a hero who has come to save the realm, at which point he breaks down and screams in anguish.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]], a man who travels to the cabin in the woods to spend the weekend with his girlfriend Linda. As the story follows, he must defeat the evil powers around him that keep growing. After enough attacks, he decides to take the evil head-on equipped with a shotgun and a chainsaw and sets out to face the enemy.\n* Sarah Berry as Annie Knowby, Professor Knowby's daughter who travels to the cabin looking forward to share her discoveries of the ''Book of the Dead'' with her father. She thinks Ash murdered her parents at first, but when the Kandarian Demon unleashes against them, she realizes the truth and finds out her only way to survive is to help Ash defeat the spirit.\n* [[Dan Hicks (actor)|Dan Hicks]] as Jake, a white-trash guy who freaks out before the demon. When things turn bad, he thinks they have to escape before they all get killed. He is accidentally stabbed in the chest by Annie when trying to escape a possessed Ash. Badly wounded but still alive, Annie tries dragging him to safety in the living room near the trapdoor to the fruit cellar, where he is attacked and eaten alive by Henrietta.\n* [[Kassie DePaiva|Kassie Wesley]] as Bobby Joe, Jake's foul-mouthed, self-centered girlfriend. She tries to escape the cabin, only to be killed by the woods themselves (in a similar fashion to how Cheryl was raped in [[The Evil Dead|the first film]]).\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Possessed Henrietta, Annie's possessed mother who uses her memories to lure her in order to kill her and everybody else, but is killed when Ash stabs her through the chest with his chainsaw.\n* Denise Bixler as Linda, Ash's girlfriend. She gets possessed, then tries to kill Ash. In a desperate effort, he beheads her with a shovel before burying her. Later on, her corpse rises from the grave and resumes her intentions to kill Ash with both her severed head and her body acting separately. He finally gets rid of her by chopping her up with a chainsaw. Bixler replaces [[Betsy Baker]], who portrayed Linda in the first film.\n* Richard Domeier as Professor Ed Getley, Professor Knowby's associate and Annie's boyfriend. After being attacked by the possessed Henrietta, he gets possessed. He meets his doom when Ash dismembers him with an axe.\n* John Peaks as Professor Knowby, the archaeologist who found the ''Book of the Dead''. When he took it to his cabin to translate it, he accidentally unleashed the Kandarian Demon. His fate remains unknown, since he only appears as a floating head from another plane of existence.\n* Lou Hancock as Henrietta Knowby, Professor Knowby's wife. She gets possessed when her husband accidentally unleashes the demon of the ''Book of the Dead''. According to the Professor's recordings he was forced to kill Henrietta when she became demonically possessed and attacked him. He then buried her body in the fruit cellar where she reanimates and remains a recurring villain (portrayed by Ted Raimi) through the second half of the film.\n* William Preston Robertson provides the voice of the Evil Dead, the film's main antagonist. It is a sinister, otherworldly spiritual presence summoned by Professor Knowby's translations of the ''Necronomicon'', and proceeds to isolate and kill the cabin's inhabitants.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe concept of a [[sequel]] to ''The Evil Dead'' was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Raimi wanted to toss his hero, Ash, through a time portal, back into the [[Middle Ages]]. That notion eventually led to the third installment, ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.\n\nAfter the release of ''The Evil Dead'', Raimi moved on to ''[[Crimewave]]'', a cross between a [[crime film]] and a [[Comedy film|comedy]] produced by Raimi and [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]]. [[Irvin Shapiro]], a publicist who was primarily responsible for the mainstream release of ''The Evil Dead'', suggested that they next work on an ''Evil Dead'' sequel. Raimi scoffed at the idea, expecting ''Crimewave'' to be a hit, but Shapiro put out ads announcing the sequel regardless.\n\nAfter ''Crimewave'' was released to little audience or critical reaction, Raimi and Tapert, knowing that another flop would further stall their already lagging careers, took Shapiro up on his offer. Around the same time, they met Italian film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the owner of production and distribution company [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|DEG]]. He had asked Raimi if he would direct a theatrical adaptation of the [[Stephen King]] (written under his [[Richard Bachman]] pseudonym) novel ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]''. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis continued to be interested in the young filmmaker.<ref name=companion>{{cite book|title=The Evil Dead Companion|last=Warren|first=Bill|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2001|isbn=9780312275013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBrJ3M71rUIC}}</ref>{{rp|135}}\n\nThe ''Thinner'' adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful [[horror fiction]]. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', based on his short story \"[[Trucks (short story)|Trucks]].\" He had dinner with a crew member who had been interviewed about the ''Evil Dead'' sequel, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|104}}\n\nThough initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed after being presented with the extremely high Italian revenue for the first film. Although Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, they were allotted only $3.6 million. As such, the planned medieval storyline had to be scrapped.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|106}}\n\n===Script===\nThough they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of ''Crimewave''. Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the [[Super 8 mm film]]s they had produced during their childhood in [[Michigan]]. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that ''Evil Dead II'' should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|109\u2013110}}\n\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]], where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors [[Frances McDormand]], [[Kathy Bates]], and [[Holly Hunter]] (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, ''Crimewave'' and [[Josh Becker]]'s ''[[Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except]]'', the script took a long time to finish.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|109}}\n\nAmong the film's many inspirations include [[The Three Stooges]] and other [[slapstick comedy]] films; Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager, entitled ''[[Attack of the Helping Hand]]'', which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising [[Hamburger Helper]]. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a [[Popeye]]-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|111}}\n\nWhile Raimi and Campbell have stated that ''Evil Dead 2'' was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first movie and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of ''The Evil Dead'' yet remains intact in ''Evil Dead 2''. The corpses of Ash\u2019s friends from the first movie are absent, and they are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.\n\n===Filming===\nWith the script completed, and a production company secured, [[principal photography]] began. The production commenced in [[Wadesboro, North Carolina]], not far from De Laurentiis' offices in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. [[Steven Spielberg]] had previously filmed ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for ''Evil Dead II''. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|113}}\n\nThe film's production was not nearly as chaotic or strange as the original film's production, largely because of Raimi, Tapert and Campbell's additional film making experience. However, there are nevertheless numerous stories about the strange happenings on the set. For instance, the rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Se\u00f1or Cojones\" by the crew (\"[[Spanish profanity#Cojones|cojones]]\" is [[Spanish language|Spanish slang]] for \"[[testicles]]\").\n\nEven so, there were hardships, mostly involving [[Ted Raimi]]'s costume. Ted, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a [[fake Shemp]], but in ''Evil Dead II'' he gets the larger role of the historian's demonically-possessed wife, Henrietta. Raimi was forced to wear a full-body, [[latex]] costume, crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\", or on one day, both. Raimi became extremely overheated, to the point that his costume was literally filled with liters of sweat; special effects artist [[Gregory Nicotero]] describes pouring the fluid into several [[Dixie Cup|Dixie cups]] so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.<ref name=companion/>{{rp|125}}\n\nThe crew sneaked various [[in-joke]]s into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of [[Freddy Krueger]] (the primary antagonist of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' series]] of [[slasher film]]s) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by [[Heather Langenkamp]]), dozes off watching the original ''Evil Dead'' on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' poster seen in the original ''Evil Dead'' film, which was itself a reference to a torn ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' poster in ''The Hills Have Eyes''.\n\nAt the film's [[wrap party]], the crew held a talent contest, where Raimi and Campbell sang [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\", with Nicotero on [[guitar]].<ref>Mentioned in Evil Dead II audio commentary</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Evil Dead II'' opened on March 13, 1987 to a weekend gross of $807,260. At this time, it was only in 310 theatres, resulting in its smaller gross. However, after spending a little over a month in theatres, the film ultimately grossed $5,923,044 domestically.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=evildead2.htm|title=Evil Dead 2 (1987)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 98% of 53 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 8/10.

Hubble also became a member of the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].

After the death of his father in 1913, Edwin returned to the Midwest from Oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law. Instead, he proceeded to teach Spanish, [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at [[New Albany High School (Indiana)|New Albany High School]] in [[New Albany, Indiana]], where he also coached the boys' basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the [[University of Chicago]] to study astronomy at the university's [[Yerkes Observatory]], where he received his Ph.D. in 1917. His [[dissertation]] was titled \"Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/photographicinve00hubbrich|title=Photographic investigations of faint nebulae|first=Edwin Powell|last=Hubble|publisher=Chicago, Ill., The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=September 15, 2016|via=Internet Archive|date=1920}}</ref>  In Yerkes, he had access to one of the most powerful telescopes in the world at the time, which had an innovative 24 inch (61&nbsp;cm) reflector.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-Hubble|title=Edwin Hubble {{!}} American astronomer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=November 20, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubble identity card.jpg|left|thumb|Hubble's identity card in the [[American Expeditionary Forces]].]]\nAfter the United States declared war on [[Germany]] in 1917, Hubble rushed to complete his Ph.D. dissertation so he could join the military. Hubble volunteered for the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to the newly created [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|86th Division]], where he served in 2nd Battalion, 343 Infantry Regiment. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel,<ref>{{cite news |title=Major Edwin Hubble is Made Lieutenant Colonel |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&query=Major+Edwin+Hubble+is+Made+Lieutenant+Colonel&t=965 |accessdate=October 19, 2015 |work=Springfield Missouri Republican |date=August 11, 1918 |page=6}}</ref> and was found fit for overseas duty on July 9, 1918, but the 86th Division never saw combat. After the end of [[World War I]], Hubble spent a year in Cambridge, where he renewed his studies of Astronomy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Edwin Hubble: Mariner of the Nebulae|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226105215|author=Gale E. Christianson|page=183}}</ref> In 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]]'s [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], near [[Pasadena, California]], by [[George Ellery Hale]], the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} reflector [[Hale Telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] near San Diego, California.\n\nHubble also worked as a civilian for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in Maryland during [[World War II]] as the Chief of the [[External Ballistics Branch]] of the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior [[ballistics]] which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles. His work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics, the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera, which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight. The results of his studies were credited with greatly improving design, performance, and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets. For his work there, he received the [[Legion of Merit]] award.<ref>Sharov, Alexander S., Igor D. Novikov \"Edwin Hubble, The Discoverer of the Big Bang Universe\".

Christianson|page=183|quote=One morning, while driving north with Grace after the failed eclipse expedition of 1923, he broached Whitehead's idea of a God who might have chosen from a great many possibilities to make a different universe, but He made this one. By contemplating the universe, one might approximate some idea of its Creator. As time passed, however, he seemed even less certain: \"We do not know why we are born into the world, but we can try to find out what sort of a world it is \u2014 at least in its physical aspects.\" His life was dedicated to science and the objective world of phenomena. The world of pure values is one which science cannot enter, and science is unconcerned with the transcendent, however, compelling a private revelation or individual moment of ecstasy. He pulled no punches when a deeply depressed friend asked him about his belief: \"The whole thing is so much bigger than I am, and I can't understand it, so I just trust myself to it, and forget about it.\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hubble Time|date=2000|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595142477|author=Tom Bezzi|page=93|quote=John terribly depressed, and asked Edwin about his belief. Edwin said, \"The whole thing is so much bigger than I am, and I can't understand it, so I just trust myself to it, and forget about it.\" It was not his nature to speculate. Theories, in his opinion, were an appropriate cocktail conversation. He was essentially an observer, and as he said in The Realm of the Nebulae: \"Not until the empirical resources are exhausted, need we pass on to the dreamy realms of speculation.\" Edwin never exhausted those empirical resources. \"I am an observer, not a theoretical man,\" he attested, and a lightly spoken word in a lecture or in a letter showed that observation was his choice.}}</ref>\n\nHubble had a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in [[Colorado]].

At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Using the Hooker Telescope at [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mt. Wilson]], Hubble identified [[Cepheid variable]]s (a kind of [[star]] that is used as a means to determine the distance from the galaxy<ref>A Science Odyssey:People and Discoveries</ref><ref>1929:Edwin Hubble Discovers the universe is expanding</ref> \u2013 see also [[standard candle]]) in several [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|spiral nebulae]], including the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Galaxy|Triangulum]]. His observations, made in 1922\u20131923, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own, suspected by researchers at least as early as 1755 when [[Immanuel Kant]]'s General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens appeared. This idea had been opposed by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by [[Harvard University]]-based [[Harlow Shapley]].

This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.<ref name=\"Gale E. Christianson 1996\" />\n\nHubble also devised the most commonly used [[Galaxy morphological classification|system for classifying galaxies]], grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the [[Hubble sequence]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Toward a new millennium in galaxy morphology|author1=David L.

Combining his  measurements of galaxy distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by [[Vesto Slipher]], and by his assistant [[Milton&nbsp;L. Humason]], he found a roughly linear relation between  the distances of the galaxies and their redshifts,<ref name=\"Hubbles Law\" /> a discovery that later became known as [[Hubble's law]].\n\nThis meant, the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. If interpreted that way, Hubble's measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the [[Hubble Constant]] of 500&nbsp;km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted value of 70&nbsp;km/s/Mpc due to errors in their distance calibrations.\n\nYet the reason for the redshift remained unclear. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]], a Belgian Catholic priest and physicist, predicted on theoretical grounds based on Einstein's equations for [[General Relativity]] the [[redshift]]-distance relation, and published observational support for it, two years before the discovery of Hubble's law.<ref name=\"nature.com\">[https://www.nature.com/articles/479171a Lost in translation: Mystery of the missing text solved Mario Livio ''Nature'' 479, 171\u2013173 (10 November 2011)]</ref> However, many cosmologists and astronomers (including Hubble himself) failed to recognize the work of Lema\u00eetre; Hubble remained doubtful about Lema\u00eetre's interpretation for his entire life.{{citation needed|reason=the paragraph up to this point is not cited|date=April 2017}} In 1931 he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist [[Willem de Sitter]] expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Hubble's diagram and cosmic expansion\n|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=101|issue=1|pages=8\u201313|author=Robert P.

We use the term 'apparent' velocities to emphasize the empirical features of the correlation. The interpretation, we feel, should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority.}}\n\nToday, the \"apparent velocities\" in question are understood as an increase in [[proper distance]] that occurs due to the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]]. Light traveling through stretching space will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism different from the [[Doppler effect]] (although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a [[coordinate transformation]] for nearby galaxies).\n\nIn the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and [[shape of the universe|spatial curvature]]. These data seemed to indicate that the universe was [[Euclidean geometry|flat]] and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to [[Allan Sandage]],\n\n{{quote|Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession. To the very end of his writings he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift \"represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature.\"<ref>[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/1996/sandage_hubble.html Sandage, Allan (1989), \"Edwin Hubble 1889\u20131953\"], ''The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada'', Vol. 83, No.6. Retrieved March 26, 2010.</ref>}}\n\nThere were methodological problems with Hubble's survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]].\nEarlier, in&nbsp;1917, [[Albert Einstein]] had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a [[cosmological constant]] (a&nbsp;\"[[Wiktionary:fudge factor|fudge factor]]\") to the equations to avoid this \"problem\". When Einstein learned of Hubble's redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by General Relativity must be real, and in later life he said that changing his equations was \"the biggest blunder of [his] life.\" In fact, Einstein apparently once visited Hubble and tried to convince him that the universe was expanding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosmological Constant|author=Public Broadcasting Station (PBS)|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=May 29, 2011|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/strange/html/strange_cosmo.html}}</ref> Hubble also discovered the [[asteroid]] [[1373 Cincinnati]] on August 30, 1935. In 1936 he wrote ''The Observational Approach to Cosmology'' and ''The Realm of the Nebulae'' which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subject's history.\n\nIn December 1941, Hubble reported to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] that results from a six-year survey with the Mt. Wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite journal|title=Savant Refutes Theory of Exploding Universe \u2013 Mt.

Historians quoted in the article were sceptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure Hubble retained priority. However, the observational astronomer [[Sidney van den Bergh]] published a paper,<ref name=\"Bergh\">{{cite arxiv |last1=Bergh |first1=Sidney van den |title=The Curious Case of Lemaitre's Equation No. 24 |eprint=1106.1195 |date=6 June 2011|class=physics.hist-ph }}</ref> suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator, they may still have been deliberate.\n\nIn November 2011, the astronomer [[Mario Livio]] reported in ''Nature'' that documents in the Lema\u00eetre archive demonstrated that the redaction had indeed been carried out by Lema\u00eetre himself, who apparently saw little point in including scientific content which had already been reported by Hubble.<ref name=\"nature.com\"/>\n\n== No Nobel Prize ==\n<!-- This heading refers to Hubble not receiving the prize -->\nAt the time, the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] did not recognize work done in astronomy.

However, the new residence being constructed for the emperor had not been completed; and initially, he must live elsewhere in the palace compound.<ref name=\"t122\"/>\n* '''877''' (''Gangy\u014d 1, 2nd month''): Ambassadors from ''[[Baekje]]'' arrived in the province of Izumo; but they were turned back.<ref name=\"t122\"/>\n* '''877''' (''Gangy\u014d 1, 6th month''): There was a great drought; and sacrifices were made at the temples of [[Hachiman shrine|Hachiman]], [[Kamo Shrine|Kamo]] and other temples in [[Ise Province]].  Eventually, it rained.<ref name=\"t122\"/>\n* '''883''' (''Gangy\u014d 7, 1st month''): In his early teens, Y\u014dzei often spent time alone; and sometimes he would feed live frogs to snakes so that he could watch the reptile swallowing; or sometimes, he would find pleasure in setting dogs and monkeys to fight.  In time, these amusements became more dangerous.  He himself executed criminals.  When he became angry, he sometimes chased after those who dared speak up; and he sometimes tried to use his sword.  Fujiwara no Mototsune, the ''[[Kanpaku]]'', used every possible opportunity to turn Y\u014dzei towards more seemly conduct, but the emperor closed his ears to all remonstrances.<ref>Titsingh, pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n* '''884''' (''Gangy\u014d 8, 1st month''): The extravagant and dangerous habits of the emperor continued unabated.  At one point, Mototsune came to the court and discovered that Y\u014dzei had arranged a bizarre scenario for his diversion:  He ordered some men to climb high into trees, and then he ordered others to use sharp lances to poke at these men in trees until they fell to their deaths.  This extraordinary event convinced Motosune that the emperor was too \"undignified\" to reign.  Mototsune reluctantly realized that someone needed to devise a strategy for deposing the emperor.  Shortly thereafter, Mototsune approached Y\u014dzei and remarked that it must be boring to be so often alone, and then Mototsune suggested that the emperor might be amused by a horse race.  Y\u014dzei was attracted to this proposition, and he eagerly encouraged Mototsune to set a time and place for the event.  It was decided that this special amusement for the emperor would take place on the 4th day of the 2nd month of Gangy\u014d 8.<ref name=\"t124\">Titsingh, p. 124.</ref>\n* '''4 March 884''' (''Gangy\u014d 8, 4th day of the 2nd month'')<!-- \u5143\u6176\u516b\u5e74\u4e8c\u6708\u56db\u65e5 -->: The pretext of a special horse race enticed the emperor to leave his palace.  Y\u014dzei traveled in a carriage which was quickly surrounded by a heavy guard.  The carriage was redirected to ''Yo se\u00ed in'' palace (''Yang tchhing yuan'') at ''Ni zio'', a town situated a short distance to the south-west of Miyako.  Mototsune confronted the emperor, explaining that his demented behavior made him incapable of reigning, and that he was being dethroned.  At this news, Y\u014dzei cried sincerely, which did attract feelings of compassion from those who witnessed his contrition.<ref name=\"t124\"/>\n\nAccording to very scanty information from the Imperial archives, including sources such as ''[[Rikkokushi]],'' and ''[[Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku]],'' Emperor Y\u014dzei murdered one of his retainers, an action that caused massive scandal in the Heian court. Japanese society during the Heian era was very sensitive to issues of \"pollution,\" both spiritual and personal.  Deaths (especially killing animals or people) were the worst acts of pollution possible, and warranted days of seclusion in order to purify oneself. Since the Emperor was seen as a divine figure and linked to the deities, pollution of such extreme degree committed by the highest source was seen as extremely ruinous. Many of the high court officials construed Emperor Y\u014dzei's actions as exceeding the bounds of acceptable behavior, and as justifiable cause for the emperor to be forcibly deposed.\n\nIn [[Kitabatake Chikafusa]]'s 14th-century account of Emperor Y\u014dzei's reign, the emperor is described as   possessing a \"violent disposition\" and unfit to be a ruler.  In the end, when Fujiwara no Mototsune, who was ''[[Sessh\u014d]]'' (regent for the child-emperor, 876\u2013880), ''Kampaku'' (chief advisor or first secretary for the emperor, 880\u2013890), and ''[[Daij\u014d Daijin]]'' (Great Minister of the Council of State), decided that Y\u014dzei should be removed from the throne, he discovered that there was general agreement amongst the ''[[kuge]]'' that this was a correct and necessary decision.<ref name=\"v171\">Varley, p.171.</ref>\n\nY\u014dzei was succeeded by his father's uncle, [[Emperor Koko|Emperor K\u014dk\u014d]]; and in the reign of K\u014dk\u014d's son, [[Emperor Uda]], the madness re-visited the tormented former emperor:\n\n* '''889''' (''[[Kanpy\u014d (era)|Kanpy\u014d]] 1, 10th month''):  The former emperor Y\u014dzei was newly attacked by the mental illness. Y\u014dzei would enter the palace and address courtiers he would meet with the greatest rudeness. He became increasingly furious.  He garroted women with the strings of musical instruments and then threw the bodies into a lake.  While riding on horseback, he directed his mount to run over people.  Sometimes he simply disappeared into the mountains where he chased wild boars and [[Sika Deer]],<ref>Titsingh, p. 127.</ref> which in [[Shinto]] cosmology, were considered to be messengers of the ''kami.''\n\nY\u014dzei lived in retirement until the age of 80.<ref name=\"v171\"/>\n\n[[Image:Tomb of Emperor Yosei.jpg|right|thumbnail|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Y\u014dzei, Kyoto]]\nThe actual site of Y\u014dzei's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Kyoto.\n\nThe [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Y\u014dzei's [[mausoleum]].

One of these clans, the [[Minamoto clan]] (\u6e90\u6c0f), is  also known as Genji.  Some of Uda's grandchildren were granted the surname ''Minamoto'' (Minamoto is the most used surname for former Japanese royalty.). In order to distinguish Uda's descendants from other Minamoto clan families (\u6e90\u6c0f) or Genji, they became known as the [[Uda Genji]] (\u5b87\u591a\u6e90\u6c0f). Some of the [[Uda Genji]] moved to [[\u014cmi Province]] and known as [[Sasaki clan]] (\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u6c0f) or [[:ja:\u8fd1\u6c5f\u6e90\u6c0f|\u014cmi Genji]] (\u8fd1\u6c5f\u6e90\u6c0f).\n\nAmong the [[Uda Genji]], [[Minamoto no Masanobu|Minamoto no Masazane]] (\u6e90\u96c5\u4fe1), a son of [[:ja:\u6566\u5b9f\u89aa\u738b|Prince Atsumi]] (\u6566\u5b9f\u89aa\u738b) succeeded in the court. Masazane became ''[[sadaijin]]'' (Minister of the Left).  One of Masazane's daughters, Minamoto no Rinshi (\u6e90\u502b\u5b50) married [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] and from this marriage three empresses dowagers and two regents (''sessh\u014d'') were born.\n\nFrom Masanobu, several [[kuge]] families originated including the Niwata, Ayanok\u014dji, Itsutsuji, \u014chara and Jik\u014dji. From his fourth son Sukeyosi, the Sasaki clan originated, and thus Ky\u014dgoku clan originated. These descendants are known as \u014cmi Genji today. From this line, [[Sasaki Takauji]] made a success at the Muromachi shogunate and the [[Amago clan]] originated from his brother.\n\n===Events of Uda's life===\nUda's father, Emperor K\u014dk\u014d, demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence. Sadami was given the clan name of [[Minamoto]] and named Minamoto no Sadami. Later, in 887, when  K\u014dk\u014d needed to appoint his successor, Sadami was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince rank with support of ''[[Sessho and Kampaku|kampaku]]'' [[Fujiwara no Mototsune]], since Sadami was adopted by a half-sister of Mototsune.  After the death of his father in November of that year, Sadami''-shinn\u014d'' ascended to the throne.\n\n* '''September 17, 887''' (''[[Ninna]] 3, 26th day of the 8th month'')<!-- [http://web.me.com/meyer.eva/www.yukikurete.de/nengo_calc.htm   NengoCalc] \u4ec1\u548c\u4e09\u5e74\u516b\u6708\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u65e5 -->:  Emperor K\u014dk\u014d died; and his third son received the succession (''senso'').

In the seventh month of 896, Emperor Uda dispatched Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capitol and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused, in keeping with Chinese practices.  Emperor Uda also issued edicts reinforcing peasant land rights from encroachment by powerful families in the capital or monastic institutions, while auditing tax collections made in the provinces.<ref name=\"borgen\" />\n\nEmperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China (\"ken-toh-shi\" \u9063\u5510\u4f7f).

three main groups of [[mammal]]s within the seal lineage, [[Pinniped]]ia. All true seals are members of the family '''Phocidae''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|o\u028a|s|\u1d7b|d|i\u02d0}}. They are sometimes called '''crawling seals''' to distinguish them from the [[fur seal]]s and [[sea lion]]s of the family [[Eared seal|Otariidae]]. Seals live in the [[ocean]]s of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more [[tropical]] [[monk seal]]s, are mostly confined to [[Polar region|polar]], subpolar, and [[temperate]] climates.  The [[Baikal seal]] is the only species of exclusively [[freshwater seal]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Phylogeny===\nIn the 1980s, [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis of the phocids has led to a few conclusions about the interrelatedness of the various genera. The four genera ''[[leopard seal|Hydrurga]]'', ''[[Weddell seal|Leptonychotes]]'', ''[[crabeater seal|Lobodon]]'', and ''[[Ross seal|Ommatophoca]]'' form a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group, the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Lobodontini]]. Likewise, the Phocinae subfamily (''[[bearded seal|Erignathus]]'', ''[[hooded seal|Cystophora]]'', and [[Phocini]]) is also monophyletic. More recently, five species have been split off from ''Phoca'', forming three additional genera. However, the subfamily Monachinae (the lobodonts  ''[[elephant seal|Mirounga]]'') is probably [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]].<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id = 14001028}}</ref>\n[[File:Cranio Pliophoca etrusca, Orciano.JPG|thumb|Fossil ''Pliophoca'' skull]] \nSuperfamily [[Pinniped]]ia\n* '''Family Phocidae'''<ref>Peter Saundry. 2010.

seal is ''[[Noriphoca]] gaudini'' from the late [[Oligocene]] or earliest [[Miocene]] ([[Aquitanian (stage)|Aquitanian]]) of [[Italy]].<ref name=Noriphoca /> Other early fossil phocids date from the mid-Miocene, 15 million years ago in the north Atlantic. Until recently, many researchers believed that phocids evolved separately from otariids and [[Walrus|odobenids]]; and that they evolved from [[otter]]-like animals, such as ''[[Potamotherium]]'', which inhabited European freshwater lakes. Recent evidence strongly suggests a monophyletic origin for all pinnipeds from a single ancestor, possibly ''[[Enaliarctos]]'', most closely related to the [[bear]]s.\n\n[[Monk seal]]s and [[elephant seal]]s are believed to have first entered the Pacific through the open straits between North and South America, which only closed in the [[Pliocene]]. The various Antarctic species may have either used the same route, or traveled down the west coast of Africa.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Savage, RJG |author2= Long, MR |last-author-amp=yes|year=1986 |title= Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 94\u201395|isbn= 0-8160-1194-X}}</ref>\n\n==Biology==\n===External anatomy===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Phoca vitulina 02 MWNH 1464.JPG|thumb|[[Harbor seal]] skull (''Phoca vitulina'')]]\nAdult phocids vary from {{convert|1.17|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight in the [[ringed seal]] to {{convert|4.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in land-based members of the [[Carnivora]], although they retain powerful [[canine tooth|canines]]. Some species lack [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s altogether. The [[dentition|dental formula]] is:\n{{DentalFormula|upper=2-3.1.4.0-2|lower=1-2.1.4.0-2}}\n\nWhile otariids are known for speed and maneuverability, phocids are known for efficient, economical movement. This allows most phocids to forage far from land to exploit prey resources, while otariids are tied to rich [[upwelling]] zones close to breeding sites. Phocids swim by sideways movements of their bodies, using their hind flippers to fullest effect.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= McLaren, Ian|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 270\u2013275|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref> Their fore flippers are used primarily for steering, while their hind flippers are bound to the [[pelvis]] in such a way that they cannot bring them under their bodies to walk on them. They are more streamlined than fur seals and sea lions, so can swim more effectively over long distances. However, because they cannot turn their hind flippers downward, they are very clumsy on land, having to wriggle with their front flippers and abdominal [[muscle]]s.\n\n[[File:Seal kidney-- FMVZ USP-08.jpg|thumb|Seal kidney]]\nPhocid respiratory and circulatory systems are adapted to allow diving to considerable depths, and they can spend a long time underwater between breaths. Air is forced from the [[lung]]s during a dive and into the upper respiratory passages, where gases cannot easily be absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps protect the seal from [[Decompression sickness|the bends]]. The [[middle ear]] is also lined with blood sinuses that inflate during diving, helping to maintain a constant pressure.<ref name=EoM/>\n\nPhocids are more specialized for [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] life than otariids. They lack external ears and have sleek, streamlined bodies. Retractable [[nipple]]s, internal [[testicle]]s, and an internal [[penile sheath]] provide further streamlining. A smooth layer of [[blubber]] lies underneath the skin. Phocids are able to divert [[blood]] flow to this layer to help control their temperatures.\n\n===Communication===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nUnlike otariids, true seals do not communicate by 'barking'. Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Earless seal (Puerto Madryn, Argentina).jpg|thumb|left|Southern elephant seals in Argentina|alt=Photo of seven adult and juvenile southern elephant seals packed closely on beach]]\n\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\n\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must [[fasting|fast]] while [[lactation|lactating]]. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the [[humpback whale]]s' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\n\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the [[monk seal]] to just three to five days in the [[hooded seal]]. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\n\n===Growth and maturation===\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories, it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even  months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The energetics of lactation in the Northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x/abstract|journal = Journal of Zoology|date = 1986-03-01|issn = 1469-7998|pages = 21\u201333|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x|first = D.

However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for [[military intelligence|military]] purposes. Spying involving [[corporation]]s is known as [[industrial espionage]].\n\nOne of the most effective ways to gather data and information about the [[enemy]] (or potential enemy) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can return information concerning the size and strength of [[enemy force]]s. They can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect.<ref>Fischbacher-Smith, D., 2015. The enemy has passed through the gate: Insider threats, the dark triad, and the challenges around security. Journal of Organizational Effectiveness: People and Performance, 2(2), pp.134-156.</ref> In times of crisis, spies steal technology and [[sabotage]] the enemy in various ways. [[Counterintelligence]] is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. Almost all [[Sovereign state|nations]] have strict laws concerning espionage and the penalty for being caught is often severe. However, the benefits gained through espionage are often so great that most governments and many large corporations make use of it.\n\nInformation collection techniques used in the conduct of [[clandestine human intelligence]] include  [[clandestine HUMINT operational techniques|operational techniques]], [[Recruitment of spies|asset recruiting]], and [[tradecraft]].\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of espionage}}<!-- Historical content must be added here.

The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred [[HUMINT|human sources]] over [[OSINT|research in open sources]], while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] and [[IMINT]]. In the Soviet Union, both political ([[KGB]]) and [[military intelligence]] ([[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]<ref>{{cite book| first = Victor| last = Suvorov| authorlink = Victor Suvorov| title = Inside the Aquarium| publisher = Berkley| year = 1987| ISBN = 0-425-09474-X}}</ref>) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.\n<!--this is financial intelligence (FININT), not espionage. If it can be sourced, this should move to FININT. Since January of 2000, a long list of agencies have been data mining the world's stock exchanges; for the US, this program was formalized on October 26, 2001, in the form of the [[Patriot Act]]. This helps track the financing of people who might be laundering money. This is done without warrants.\nThe PATRIOT act is by no means the only legislation involved here. See, for example, the [[Bank Secrecy Act]], the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and, to some extent, the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]-->\n\n== Targets of espionage ==\nEspionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development. Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nBroad areas of espionage targeting expertise include:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n* [[Natural resource]]s: strategic production identification and assessment (food, energy, materials). Agents are usually found among bureaucrats who administer these resources in their own countries\n* [[Public opinion|Popular sentiment]] towards domestic and foreign policies (popular, middle class, elites). Agents often recruited from field journalistic crews, exchange postgraduate students and sociology researchers\n* Strategic economic strengths (production, research, manufacture, infrastructure). Agents recruited from science and technology academia, commercial enterprises, and more rarely from among military technologists\n* [[Military capability]] intelligence (offensive, defensive, maneuver, naval, air, space). Agents are trained by military espionage education facilities, and posted to an area of operation with covert identities to minimize prosecution\n* [[Counterintelligence]] operations targeting opponents' intelligence services themselves, such as breaching confidentiality of communications, and recruiting defectors or moles\n\n== Methods and terminology ==\nAlthough the news media may speak of \"spy satellites\" and the like, espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines. It is a specific form of human source intelligence (HUMINT). Codebreaking ([[cryptanalysis]] or [[COMINT]]), aircraft or satellite photography, ([[IMINT]]) and research in open publications (OSINT) are all intelligence gathering disciplines, but none of them is considered espionage. Many HUMINT activities, such as prisoner [[interrogation]], reports from military [[reconnaissance]] patrols and from diplomats, etc., are not considered espionage.  Espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information (classified) to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information.\n\nUnlike other forms of [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection disciplines]], espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of [[deception|subterfuge]]. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the [[Oslo Report]], or the insistence of [[Robert Hanssen]] in never meeting the people who bought his information.\n\nThe US defines espionage towards itself as \"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\". ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (1990) defines espionage as: \"...&nbsp;gathering, transmitting, or losing&nbsp;... information related to the [[defense (military)|national defense]]\". Espionage is a violation of United States law, {{UnitedStatesCode|18|792|798}} and Article 106a of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=US Department of Defense |authorlink=U.S. Department of Defense |title=Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |date=2007-07-12 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108082044/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-08 |df= }}</ref> The United States, like most nations, conducts espionage against other nations, under the control of the [[National Clandestine Service]].

Within the [[United States Intelligence Community]], \"asset\" is a more common usage. A [[case officer]] or [[Special Agent]], who may have [[diplomatic protection|diplomatic status]] (i.e., [[official cover]] or [[non-official cover]]), supports and directs the human collector. Cutouts are [[courier]]s who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages. A [[safe house]] is a refuge for spies. Spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source.\n\nIn larger networks the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection, including [[clandestine cell system]]s.  Often the players have never met.  Case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and to supervise intelligence agents, who in turn spy on targets in their countries where they are assigned. A spy need not be a citizen of the target country\u2014hence does not automatically commit [[treason]] when operating within it. While the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information, sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity (cover background), called a ''legend'' in [[tradecraft]], may attempt to infiltrate a target organization.\n\nThese agents can be [[mole (espionage)|moles]] (who are recruited before they get access to secrets), [[Defection|defectors]] (who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country) or [[Clandestine HUMINT#Defector in place|defectors in place]] (who get access but do not leave).\n\nA ''legend'' is also employed for an individual who ''is not'' an illegal agent, but is an ordinary citizen who is \"relocated\", for example, a \"protected witness\". Nevertheless, such a non-agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as controller. As in most, if not all synthetic identity schemes, for whatever purpose (illegal or legal), the assistance of a controller is required.\n\nSpies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted, such as giving false reports about their country's military movements, or about a competing company's ability to bring a product to market. Spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration, such as [[sabotage]].\n\nMany governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as [[SCG International Risk]], [[International Intelligence Limited]] and others.\n\nMany organizations, both national and non-national, conduct espionage operations. It should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country.  National and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targets.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks.\n\nCommunications both are necessary to espionage and [[clandestine operation]]s, and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated SIGINT detection and interception capability. Agents must also transfer money securely.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n== Industrial espionage ==\n{{Main|Industrial espionage}}\nReportedly [[Canada]] is losing $12 billion<ref>\"[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/06/15/spies050615.html Defectors say China running 1,000 spies in Canada]\".

In popular usage, this term is often erroneously applied to a member of an intelligence service who recruits and handles agents; in espionage such a person is referred to as an ''intelligence officer'', ''intelligence operative'' or ''case officer''.  There are several types of agent in use today:\n*[[Double agent]]: \"engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services (or more in joint operations), who provides information about one or about each to the other, and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary. [[Peddler]]s, [[fabricator (intelligence)|fabricator]]s, and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents. The fact that double agents have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations, who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity.\"<ref name=\"double_agent\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol6no1/html/v06i1a05p_0001.htm |title=Double Agent |publisher=cia.gov}}</ref>\n*[[Re-doubled agent|Redoubled agent]]: forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service after being caught as a double agent.\n*Unwitting double agent: offers or is forced to recruit as a double or redoubled agent and in the process is recruited by either a third-party intelligence service or his own government without the knowledge of the intended target intelligence service or the agent. This can be useful in capturing important information from an agent that is attempting to seek allegiance with another country. The '''double agent''' usually has knowledge of both intelligence services and can identify operational techniques of both, thus making third-party recruitment difficult or impossible. The knowledge of operational techniques can also affect the relationship between the [[operations officer]] (or [[case officer]]) and the agent if the case is transferred by an [[operational targeting officer]] to a new operations officer, leaving the new officer vulnerable to attack. This type of transfer ''may'' occur when an officer has completed his term of service or when his ''cover'' is blown.\n*[[Triple agent]]: works for three intelligence services.\n*Intelligence agent: provides access to [[sensitive information]] through the use of special privileges. If used in ''corporate intelligence'' gathering, this may include gathering information of a corporate business venture or [[Portfolio (finance)|stock portfolio]]. In ''economic intelligence'', \"Economic Analysts may use their specialized skills to analyze and interpret economic trends and developments, assess and track foreign financial activities, and develop new econometric and modeling methodologies.\"<ref name=\"Economic_intelligence\">Cia.gov</ref> This may also include information of trade or tariff.\n*Access agent: provides access to other potential agents by providing [[Offender profiling|profiling]] information that can help lead to recruitment into an intelligence service.\n*Agent of influence: provides [[political influence]] in an area of interest, possibly including [[propaganda|publications]] needed to further an intelligence service agenda. The use of the media to print a story to [[disinformation|mislead]] a foreign service into action, exposing their operations while under surveillance.\n*[[Agent provocateur]]: instigates trouble or provides information to gather as many people as possible into one location for an arrest.\n*[[Facilities agent]]: provides access to buildings, such as [[Garage (residential)|garages]] or offices used for [[staging area|staging]] operations, resupply, etc.\n*Principal agent: functions as a [[Agent handling|handler]] for an established network of agents, usually considered \"blue chip.\"\n*[[Confusion agent]]: provides misleading information to an enemy intelligence service or attempts to discredit the operations of the ''target'' in an operation.\n*[[Sleeper agent]]: recruited to ''wake up'' and perform a specific set of tasks or functions while living under cover in an area of interest. This type of agent is not the same as a ''[[deep cover]] operative'', who continually contacts a case officer to file [[intelligence report]]s. A sleeper agent is not in contact with anyone until ''activated''.\n*[[Illegal agent]]: lives in another country under [[Identity document forgery|false credentials]] and does not report to a local station. A nonofficial cover operative can be dubbed an \"illegal\"<ref name=\"Illegal\">[https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/how-do-spies-operate.html Illegal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106175822/https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/how-do-spies-operate.html |date=January 6, 2011 }} Mi5.gov -How spies operate.</ref> when working in another country without diplomatic protection.\n\n== Law ==\nEspionage is a crime under the [[legal code]] of many nations. In the United States it is covered by the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. The risks of espionage vary. A spy breaking the host country's laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed. A spy breaking their own country's laws can be imprisoned for espionage or/and [[treason]] (which in the US and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime), or even executed, as the [[Rosenbergs]] were. For example, when [[Aldrich Ames]] handed a stack of dossiers of U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents in the [[Eastern Bloc]] to his KGB-officer \"handler\", the [[KGB]] \"rolled up\" several networks, and at least ten people were secretly shot. When Ames was arrested by the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), he faced life in prison; his contact, who had [[diplomatic immunity]], was declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' and taken to the airport. Ames' wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate; he did, and she was given a five-year sentence. [[Hugh Francis Redmond]], a CIA officer in China, spent nineteen years in a Chinese prison for espionage\u2014and died there\u2014as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA Status Improves Contractor's Case for Immunity|url=http://newamericamedia.org/2011/02/cia-status-improves-contractors-case-for-immunity.php|publisher=New America Media}}</ref>\n\nIn United States law, treason,<ref>[http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+1130+29++%28treason%29 treason] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024319/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+1130+29++%28treason%29 |date=December 3, 2012 }}</ref> espionage,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024325/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+486+45++%28espionage%25 espionage]</ref> and spying<ref>[http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+600+1++%28spying%29%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20 spying] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024508/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+600+1++%28spying%29%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20 |date=December 3, 2012 }}</ref> are separate crimes.  Treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels.\n\nThe United States in [[World War I]] passed the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. Over the years, many spies, such as the [[Soble spy ring]], [[Robert Lee Johnson (spy)|Robert Lee Johnson]], [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|the Rosenberg ring]], [[Aldrich Hazen Ames]],<ref name=jyaames /> [[Robert Philip Hanssen]],<ref name=fashans /> [[Jonathan Pollard]], [[John Anthony Walker]], [[James Hall III]], and others have been prosecuted under this law.\n\n===History of espionage laws===\nFrom ancient times, the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution. This was true right up until the era of [[World War II]]; for example, [[Josef Jakobs]] was a Nazi spy who parachuted into Great Britain in 1941 and was executed for espionage.\n\nIn modern times, many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution. For example, [[Aldrich Hazen Ames]] is an American CIA analyst, turned KGB mole, who was convicted of espionage in 1994; he is serving a [[life sentence]] without the possibility of parole in the high-security [[United States Penitentiary, Allenwood|Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary]].<ref name=\"Federal Bureau of Prisons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&LastName=Ames&Middle=&FirstName=Aldrich+&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=23&y=24 |title=Aldrich Hazen Ames Register Number: 40087-083 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons |work=Bop.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}} ''(Search result)''</ref> Ames was formerly a 31-year [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[counter-intelligence|counterintelligence]] officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by [[spying]] for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/aldrich-hazen-ames|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013065115/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/aldrich-hazen-ames|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-10-13|title=FBI \u2014 Aldrich Hazen Ames|work=FBI}}</ref> So far as it is known, Ames compromised the second-largest number of CIA agents, second only to [[Robert Hanssen]], who is also serving a prison sentence.\n\n=== Use against non-spies ===\nEspionage laws are also used to prosecute non-spies. In the United States, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] was used against socialist politician [[Eugene V. Debs]] (at that time the Act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting). The law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals, for example of [[Father Coughlin]] in [[World War II]]. In the early 21st century, the act was used to prosecute [[whistleblower]]s such as [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], [[John Kiriakou]], and [[Edward Snowden]], as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons, such as [[Stephen Jin-Woo Kim]].<ref name=josh_gerstein1 /><ref>See the article on [[John Kiriakou]]</ref>\n\n{{as of|2012}}, India and Pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other's country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of espionage attached. Some of these include cases where Pakistan and India both deny citizenship to these people, leaving them [[statelessness|stateless]]. The BBC reported in 2012 on one such case, that of Mohammed Idrees, who was held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2\u20133 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999. Much of the 13 years was spent in prison waiting for a hearing, and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families. The Indian [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] and [[Human Rights Law Network]] both decried his treatment. The BBC attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the [[Kashmir conflict]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/43/ws-nowhereman.html Your World: The Nowhere Man], Rupa Jha, October 21, 2012, BBC (retrieved 2012-10-20) (Program link:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00z57wt The Nowhere Man])</ref>\n\n=== Espionage laws in the UK ===\nEspionage is illegal in the UK under the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920. The UK law under this legislation considers espionage as \"concerning those who intend to help an enemy and deliberately harm the security of the nation\". According to [[MI5]], a person commits the offence of 'spying' if they, \"for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State\": approaches, enters or inspects a prohibited area; makes documents such as plans that are intended, calculated, or could directly or indirectly be of use to an enemy; or \"obtains, collects, records, or publishes, or communicates to any other person any secret official code word, or pass word, or any sketch, plan, model, article, or note, or other document which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\". The illegality of espionage also includes any action which may be considered 'preparatory to' spying, or encouraging or aiding another to spy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/the-threats/espionage/espionage-and-the-law.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925142433/https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/the-threats/espionage/espionage-and-the-law.html |archivedate=2014-09-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAn individual convicted of espionage can be imprisoned for up to 14 years in the UK, although multiple sentences can be issued.\n\n=== Government intelligence laws and its distinction from espionage ===\nGovernment intelligence is very much distinct from espionage, and is not illegal in the UK, providing that the organisations of individuals are registered, often with the ICO, and are acting within the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). 'Intelligence' is considered legally as \"information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions. It includes information that may be both public and private, obtained from many different public or secret sources. It could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources, or be a combination of the two.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/the-threats/espionage/what-is-espionage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101174455/https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/the-threats/espionage/what-is-espionage.html |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nHowever, espionage and intelligence can be linked. According to the MI5 website, \"foreign intelligence officers acting in the UK under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution. Such persons can only be tried for spying (or, indeed, any criminal offence) if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand. Those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution\".\n\nThere are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance. Generally, the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government, and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens. Those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only RIPA, but also the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. However, there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted.\n\n=== Military conflicts ===\n[[File:L'espion - Alphonse de Neuville - 1880.jpg|thumb|French spy captured during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].]]\nIn military conflicts, espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other. To make the mission easier and successful, soldiers or agents wear [[disguise]]s to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering. However, if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises, they are not entitled to [[prisoner-of-war]] status and subject to [[prosecution]] and punishment\u2014including [[execution]].\n\nThe [[Hague Convention of 1907]] addresses the status of wartime spies, specifically within \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: CHAPTER II Spies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/1d1726425f6955aec125641e0038bfd6?OpenDocument |title=Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex: Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land. The Hague, 18 October 1907. |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}</ref> Article 29 states that a person is considered a spy who, acts clandestinely or on false pretenses, infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the [[belligerent]] during times of war. Soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are [[Combatant#Privileged combatants|lawful combatants]] entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy. Article 30 states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial. However, Article 31 provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant, he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war. Note that this provision does not apply to citizens who committed [[treason]] against their own country or co-belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crime Wars: The Global Intersection of Crime, Political Violence, and International Law |author1=Paul Battersby |author2=Joseph M.

Five days later, six were executed by [[electric chair]] at the District of Columbia jail. Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to prison terms. In 1948, they were released by President [[Harry S. Truman]] and deported to the [[American Zone of Occupation#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of occupied Germany]].\n\nThe U.S. codification of enemy spies is Article 106 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. This provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be \"lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft, within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States, or elsewhere\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/mcm/bl106.htm|title=UCMJ \u2013 Article 106 \u2013 Spies|work=About.com US Military|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515214735/http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/mcm/bl106.htm|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Spy fiction ==\n{{Main|Spy fiction}}\nSpies have long been favorite topics for novelists and film makers.<ref>Brett F. Woods, ''Neutral Ground: A Political History of Espionage Fiction'' (2008) [https://www.questia.com/library/120076034/neutral-ground-a-political-history-of-espionage online]</ref>  An early example of espionage literature is ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' by the English novelist [[Rudyard Kipling]], with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the [[Great Game]] between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] and [[Russia]] in 19th century [[Central Asia]]. An even earlier work was [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s classic novel, ''The Spy,'' written in 1821, about an American spy in New York during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].\n\nDuring the many 20th century spy scandals, much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real-life secret agents. These sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off-limits to [[Human interest story|human interest news reporting]], a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work. To fill in the blanks, the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by 20th and 21st century fiction and film. Attractive and sociable real-life agents such as [[Valerie Plame]] find little employment in serious fiction, however.  The fictional secret agent is more often a loner, sometimes amoral\u2014an [[existentialism|existential]] hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society. Loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner [[private investigator]] characters that sold well from the 1920s to the present.<ref>Toby Miller, ''Spyscreen: Espionage on Film and TV from the 1930s to the 1960s'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).</ref>\n\n[[Johnny Fedora]] achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early [[Cold War espionage]], but [[James Bond]] is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle.  His less fantastic rivals include Le Carre's [[George Smiley]] and [[Harry Palmer]] as played by [[Michael Caine]].\n\nJumping on the spy bandwagon, other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists, such as  ''[[The Baroness (novels)|The Baroness]]'', which has more graphic action and sex, as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists.\n\nIt also made its way into the [[videogame]] world, hence the famous creation of [[Hideo Kojima]], the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' Series.\n\nEspionage has also made its way into comedy depictions.  The 1960s TV series ''[[Get Smart (TV series)|Get Smart]]'' portrays an inept spy, while the 1985 movie ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' depicts a pair of none-too-bright men sent to the Soviet Union to investigate a missile.\n\n=== World War II: 1939\u20131945 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n| '''Author(s)''' || '''Title''' || '''Publisher''' || '''Date'''  || '''Notes'''\n|-\n| [[Constance Babington Smith|Babington-Smith, Constance]] || ''Air Spy: The Story of Photo Intelligence in World War II'' || \u2014 || 1957 || \u2014\n|-\n| [[Moe Berg|Berg, Moe]] || ''The Catcher Was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg'' || Vintage Books || 1994 || \u2014 Major league baseball player and OSS Secret Intelligence (SI) spy in Yugoslavia\n|-\n| Bryden, John || ''Best-Kept Secret: Canadian Secret Intelligence in the Second World War'' || Lester || 1993 || \u2014\n|-\n| [[Helias Doundoulakis|Doundoulakis, Helias]]|| ''Trained to be an OSS Spy'' || Xlibris || 2014 || OSS Secret Intelligence (SI) spy in Greece\n|-\n| [[Virginia Hall|Hall, Virginia]]|| ''The Spy with the Wooden Leg: The Story of Virginia Hall'' || Alma Little || 2012 || SOE and OSS spy in France \n|-\n| [[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, F.

''Exile III'' was also ported to [[Linux]] by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the [[Avernum|''Avernum'' series]]. Common to all games in the ''Exile'' series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of Exile I and II had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with Exile III's graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn each game, the player is required to create six characters to form a party of adventurers or may instead use a default party. The characters' general, combat, magic and miscellaneous skills can be customized along with the character names and graphics. From Exile II onward, characters can have their traits and race configured.\n\nThe games have three modes including Outdoor Mode, Town Mode and Combat Mode. In Outdoor Mode, the party can enter a town, engage a group of enemies in Combat Mode and rest (if the party has food). In Town Mode, the party can talk to people, purchase from shops (provided they have enough gold), train the characters (provided they have sufficient gold and skill points), find sub-quests, pick up items (From Exile 2 onward, items can be stolen) and enter Combat Mode. In Combat Mode, the party can attack enemies, defend themselves and pick up adjacent items. Combat Mode can be ended at any time in towns, but can only end outdoors when all enemies are killed.\n\nMagic is divided into Mage and Priest spell types. Spells for attacking can be only be cast in Combat Mode. Some spells, such as Light spells, can be cast at any time. Other spells can only be cast outdoors or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with spells up to level 3, but higher level or certain spells must be purchased or found in special encounters.\n\n==Games==\n[[Image:Exile shot.png|thumb|175px|right|A screenshot from the Mac edition of Exile I]]\n\n===''Exile I: Escape from the Pit''===\nThe first game of the ''Exile'' trilogy released in January 1995 sees a party of newly created [[Player character|characters]] thrown from the world above into the subterranean world known as Exile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/exile/winexile.html|title=Exile: Escape From the Pit v2.0 for Windows|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Once here, the party discovers a civilization formed from the outcasts of the Empire above, a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. The party meets with many of those who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the peoples of Exile.\n\nThe characters become a rallying point around which the people of Exile who desire vengeance gather to focus their energies into finding a way to strike back against the cruel Emperor of the surface. Together, the party manages to assassinate Emperor Hawthorne in his throne room, banish the demon king Grah-hoth who was becoming a significant threat to the citizens of Exile, and secure an escape route to the surface..\n\n===''Exile II: Crystal Souls''===\nThe second ''Exile'' game follows directly from the first, released in November 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/exile2/winexile2.html|title=Exile II: Crystal Souls 2.0.1 for Windows|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The Empire has begun to recognise the threat the Exiles pose and begin sending their army down into Exile in huge numbers. To make matters worse, unknown [[fence|barriers]] of [[Magic (paranormal)|energy]] are sprouting up around the world &ndash; sometimes aiding the Exiles, sometimes helping the Empire who can afford the losses much more easily than the Exiles.\n\nA new party of characters meets one of the creatures causing the barriers sprouting up in Exile and go to meet with the unknown race to negotiate. In the end, the party is more successful - and the [[Vahnatai]] join with the Exiles to drive out the Empire. With the support of the Vahnatai the Exiles turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repulse their invasion.\n\n===''Exile III: Ruined World''===\nThe final release in the ''Exile'' trilogy takes place some time after ''Exile II'', released in January 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/exile3/winexile3.html|title=Exile III: Ruined World for Windows v1.0|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The Linux version was ported by [http://www.boutell.com/ Boutell.com] in Summer, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gacetadelinux.com/en/lg/issue55/issue55.html|title=Exile III: Ruined World for Linux|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> A lot of preparation has taken place and now the Exiles are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. However, while the members of the expedition are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes the party encounters are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste.\n\nWhile [[Reconnaissance|scouting]] the land, as were the expedition members' orders from the nation of Exile, the members are asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. They bring the Exiles and the Empire together as allies trying to find the cause of the destruction.\n\n[[Image:BOEcombat1.GIF|right|thumb|A screenshot of combat in the Mac edition of Blades of Exile]]\n\n===''Blades of Exile''===\n''Blades of Exile'' released in December 1997, consists of three short [[scenarios]] set after the main trilogy as well as an [[Level editor|editor]] that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the Exile game world at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/blades/winBOE.html|title=Blades of Exile|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997.

Each iteration sported a new layout and color scheme, as well the individual elements, like the inventory and character roster boxes, were also changed to display information differently. Between ''Exile I'' and ''Exile II'' the most notable difference is a background color change as well as a change to the border of the play window. Between ''Exile II'' and ''Exile III'' the interface was changed significantly in that the colors and window styles were changed again but the player roster was overhauled and an inventory window was added.

This pilgrimage involved travelling to 33 locations across the eight provinces of the [[Bando]] area.\n\nHe was told to visit these 33 sites, in order to bring release from suffering, by [[Kannon Bosatsu]] in a vision.\n\nIt is said that the first site of the pilgrimage was the Sugimoto-dera in Kamakura. This site is also the first site on the Kamakura pilgrimage.\n\nIt is suggested by many scholars that the mental health of Kazan, particularly in later life, was not stable; and therefore, living as a monk may have caused deteriorating behavior.\n\n[[Image:Go-shichi no kiri crest 2.svg|thumb|left|140px|Decorative emblems (''kiri'') of the Hosokawa clan are found at [[Ryoan-ji]].

Costello failed to chart with his early singles, which included  \"Less Than Zero\" and the ballad \"Alison\". Stiff's records were initially distributed only in the UK, which meant that Costello's first album and singles were available in the US as imports only.

Added to the U.S. version of ''My Aim Is True'', the song contained scathing verses about the vicarious enjoyment of TV violence over a reggae beat.

Costello also found time in 1979 to produce [[Specials (album)|the debut album]] for the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska revival band [[the Specials]] and worked as a backing vocalist on 'This Is Your Life', an album by New Wave band Twist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Twist-This-Is-Your-Life/release/4207066 |title=Twist (9) - This Is Your Life (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-23}}</ref>\n\nCostello's standing in the U.S. was bruised for a time when in March 1979, during a drunken argument with [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]] in a [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[Holiday Inn]] bar, the singer referred to [[James Brown]] as a \"jive-ass [[nigger]]\", then upped the ante by pronouncing [[Ray Charles]] a \"blind, ignorant nigger\".<ref>{{Cite book|first=Greil|last=Marcus|title=In The Fascist Bathroom | year=1993 | work=Penguin Books | location=London, England | isbn=0-14-014940-6 | page=229}}</ref> Costello apologised at a New York City press conference a few days later, claiming that he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious in order to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, \"it became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster.\" In his liner notes for the expanded version of ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'' Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, though Charles himself had forgiven Costello saying \"Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper.\" Costello worked extensively in Britain's [[Rock Against Racism]] campaign both before and after the incident.  In an interview with [[Questlove]] (drummer for [[the Roots]], whom Costello collaborated with in 2013), he addressed the controversy, stating: \"It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that,\" and further elaborating with, \"I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Courtney E.|title=Elvis Costello Opens Up About 1979 Racial Slurs in Interview With ?uestlove|url=http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/|website=Radio.com|accessdate=10 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916121400/http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/|archive-date=16 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCostello is also an avid country music fan and has cited [[George Jones]] as his favourite country singer. In 1977, he appeared on Jones' duet album ''[[My Very Special Guests]]'', contributing \"Stranger in the House\", which they later performed together on an [[HBO]] special dedicated to Jones.\n\n===1980s===\nThe soul-infused ''Get Happy!!'' was the first of Costello's many experiments with genres beyond those with which he is ordinarily associated.  It also marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner.  The single, \"[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]\" was an old [[Sam and Dave]] song (though Costello increased the [[tempo]] considerably). Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature word play, to the point that he later felt he had become something of a self-parody and toned it down on later releases; he has mockingly described himself in interviews as \"rock and roll's [[Scrabble]] champion.\" His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave]] festival in August near Toronto.\n\nIn January 1981, Costello released ''[[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|Trust]]'' amidst growing tensions within the Attractions, particularly between Bruce and Pete Thomas. In the U.S., the single \"Watch Your Step\" was released and played live on [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''Tomorrow'' show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the U.K., the single \"[[Clubland (song)|Clubland]]\" scraped the lower reaches of the charts; follow-up single \"From a Whisper to a Scream\" (a duet with [[Glenn Tilbrook]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the charts. Costello also co-produced Squeeze's popular 1981 album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'' (with [[Roger Bechirian]]) and also performed backing vocals on the group's hit \"Tempted\".\n\nOctober saw the release of ''[[Almost Blue]]'', an album of country music cover songs written by the likes of [[Hank Williams]] (\"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)\"), [[Merle Haggard]] (\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\") and [[Gram Parsons]] (\"How Much I Lied\"). The album, which received mixed reviews, was a tribute to the country music that Costello had grown up listening to, especially George Jones. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: \"WARNING: This album contains country & western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners.\" ''Almost Blue'' did spawn a surprise UK hit single in a version of George Jones' \"[[Good Year for the Roses]]\" (written by [[Jerry Chesnut]]), which reached No.&nbsp;6.\n\n''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) had a much darker sound, due in part to the lavish production of [[Geoff Emerick]], famed for engineering several [[The Beatles|Beatles]] records. ''Imperial Bedroom'' remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again failed to produce any hit singles. Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. The album also featured Costello's song \"[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]\", inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter [[Chet Baker]], who would later perform and record a version of the song (''Chet Baker in Tokyo'').\n\nIn 1983, he released ''[[Punch the Clock]]'', featuring female backing vocal duo ([[Afrodiziak]]) and a four-piece horn section ([[the TKO Horns]]), alongside the Attractions. [[Clive Langer]] (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became \"[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]\", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for former [[Soft Machine]] founder [[Robert Wyatt]].\n\nUnder the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released \"Pills and Soap\", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by [[Thatcherism]], released to coincide with the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 U.K. general election]]. ''Punch the Clock'' also generated an international hit in the single \"[[Everyday I Write the Book]]\", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first [[Top 40]] hit single in the U.S. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] song \"Tomorrow's Just Another Day\" released as a [[B-side]].\n\nTensions within the band\u2014notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas\u2014were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'' (1984). Costello would later say of this record that they had \"got it as wrong as you can in terms of the execution\". The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 [[Rykodisc]] re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words \"Congratulations! You've just purchased our worst album\". Costello's retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, ''Elvis Costello: The Man'' in the UK, Europe and Australia, and ''[[The Best of Elvis Costello & The Attractions]]'' in the U.S.\n\nIn 1985, he appeared in the [[Live Aid]] benefit concert in England, singing the Beatles' \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" as a solo artist. (The event was overrunning and Costello was asked to \"ditch the band\".) Costello introduced the song as an \"old northern English folk song\", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend [[T-Bone Burnett]] for the single \"The People's Limousine\" under the moniker of The Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced ''[[Rum Sodomy & the Lash]]'' for the Irish punk/folk band [[the Pogues]].\n\nGrowing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the U.S. with Burnett, a band containing a number of [[Elvis Presley]]'s sidemen (including [[James Burton]] and [[Jerry Scheff]]), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced ''[[King of America]]'', an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by \"The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates\" in the UK and Europe and \"The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello\" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at [[Self Aid]], a benefit concert held in [[Dublin]] that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.\n\nLater that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded ''[[Blood and Chocolate (album)|Blood and Chocolate]]'', which was lauded for a [[post-punk]] fervour not heard since 1978's ''This Year's Model''. It also marked the return of producer [[Nick Lowe]], who had produced Costello's first five albums. While ''Blood and Chocolate'' failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, \"I Want You.\" On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the [[emcee]] that he played during the [[vaudeville]]-style tour to support ''Blood and Chocolate''. (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single \"Imperial Bedroom\" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite & the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for ''Blood & Chocolate'', Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to tensions between Costello and Bruce Thomas. Costello would continue to work with Attraction Pete Thomas as a session musician for future releases.\n\nCostello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after ''Blood & Chocolate''. In 1987 he released compilation album, ''[[Out of Our Idiot]]'' on his U.K. label, [[Demon Records]] consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and in early 1989 released ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', which spawned his biggest single in the U.S., the Top 20 hit \"[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]\", one of several songs Costello co-wrote with [[Paul McCartney]]. At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] on 6 September in Los Angeles, \"Veronica\" won the MTV Award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/winners-by-category.jhtml 1989 MTV Video Music Awards: Video Vanguard Award] MTV.com. Retrieved 7 December 2011</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Costello released ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]'', which featured the single \"The Other Side of Summer\". He also co-composed and co-produced, with [[Richard Harvey]], the [[G.B.H. (soundtrack)|title and incidental music for the mini-series]] ''[[G.B.H. (TV series)|G.B.H.]]'' by [[Alan Bleasdale]]. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.\n\nIn 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the [[Brodsky Quartet]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Juliet Letters (review) |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=18 March 1993 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318}}</ref><ref>1993 Review of \"The Juliet Letters\" by Bradley Smith. Retrieved May 2009 {{Dubious|date=July 2011|publication not listed, unverifiable}}</ref> on ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''. During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for [[Wendy James]], and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album ''Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears''. Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, ''[[Brutal Youth]]''. In 1995, he released ''[[Kojak Variety]]'', an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''. This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.\n\nIn the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of ''All This Useless Beauty''. An ensuing summer and fall tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell for the band. With relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final U.S. show in [[Seattle]], Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello would still continue to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both would be members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.\n\nTo fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled ''[[Extreme Honey]]'' (1997). It contained an original track titled \"The Bridge I Burned\", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 [[Meltdown Festival]], which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live [[Extended play|EP]] with jazz guitarist [[Bill Frisell]], which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.\n\nIn 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with [[Polygram Records]], sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the [[Universal Music Group]]. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with [[Burt Bacharach]]. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on a song called \"God Give Me Strength\" for the movie ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''. This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album ''[[Painted From Memory]]'', released under his new contract in 1998, on the [[Mercury Records]] label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his marriage to [[Cait O'Riordan]]. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with a full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" for the soundtrack to ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote \"I Throw My Toys Around\" for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' and performed it with [[No Doubt]]. The same year, he collaborated with [[Paddy Moloney]] of [[The Chieftains]] on \"The Long Journey Home\" on the soundtrack of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]/[[Disney]] [[The Irish in America: Long Journey Home]] miniseries. The soundtrack won a [[Grammy]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=1999 Grammy Awards|work=Billboard|date=6 March 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Costello contributed a version of \"[[She (Charles Aznavour)|She]]\", released in 1974 by [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Herbert Kretzmer]], for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'', with [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] producing. For the 25th anniversary of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the [[Beastie Boys]]' \"Sabotage\", and they acted as his backing group for \"Radio Radio\".\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Elvis costello.jpg|thumb|Elvis Costello performing at a [[Advertising campaign|Promotional]] concert (Summer 2006)]]\n[[File:Elvis Costello 15 June 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Costello performing at Glastonbury, 2005]]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalog in the U.S., from ''My Aim Is True'' (1977) to ''All This Useless Beauty'' (1996), on double-disc collections on the [[Rhino Records]] label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalog. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of ''My Aim Is True'' and ''This Year's Model'' with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.\n\nIn 2000, Costello appeared at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|the Town Hall]], New York, in Steve Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'', alongside [[Ron Sexsmith]] and [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]]. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]]. He released the album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]'' in 2002 on [[Island Records]], and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, [[Davey Faragher]], formerly of [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]]). He appeared as himself in the \"[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]\" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.\n\nOn 23 February 2003, Costello, along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Van Zandt]], and [[Dave Grohl]], performed a version of [[the Clash]]'s \"[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]\" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]], who had died the previous December.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |title=Great Bruce Springsteen Collaborations: 'London Calling' With Dave Grohl and Elvis Costello |author= |year= |publisher=Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone.com |accessdate=27 September 2015 }}</ref> In March, Elvis Costello & the Attractions were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. He announced his engagement in May to Canadian [[jazz]] singer and pianist [[Diana Krall]], whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia. That September, he released ''[[North (Elvis Costello album)|North]]'', an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall. Also that year, Costello made an appearance in the television series ''[[Frasier]]'' as a folk singer in the Cafe Nervosa, sending Frasier and Niles on a search for a new coffee bar.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0582393/ \"''Frasier'':Farewell, Nervosa\"].

Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, ''[[The Girl in the Other Room]]'', the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, ''[[Il Sogno]]'', was performed in New York. The work, a ballet after [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from the classical music critics. Performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], the recording was released on CD in September by [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. In September 2004, Costello released the album ''[[The Delivery Man]]'', recorded in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], on [[Lost Highway Records]], and it was hailed as one of his best.\n\n[[File:Elvis Costello - European Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|Costello's hand prints on the European Walk of Fame, [[Rotterdam]]]]\nA CD recording of a collaboration with [[Marian McPartland]] on her show ''[[Piano Jazz]]'' was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano. In November, Costello started recording a new album with [[Allen Toussaint]] and producer [[Joe Henry]]. ''[[The River in Reverse]]'' was released in the UK on the [[Verve Records|Verve]] label the following year in May.\n\nA 2005 tour included a gig at [[Glastonbury]] that Costello considered so dreadful that he said \"I don't care if I ever play England again.

I don't dig it, they don't dig me....British music fans don't have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say [[Willie Nelson]].

The result was Costello's ''The River in Reverse'' which is a collaboration with New Orleanian, Allen Toussaint and recorded with The Crescent City Horns. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn a studio recording of Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'' (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with [[Barbara Bonney]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the ''Billboard'' classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris in 2008, with Sting, [[Joe Sumner]] (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], entitled ''My Flame Burns Blue''. The soundtrack for ''[[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]]'' featured Costello's interpretation of \"Beautiful\" by [[Christina Aguilera]], with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.\n\nCostello was commissioned to write a [[chamber opera]] by the Danish Royal Opera, [[Copenhagen]], on the subject of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s infatuation with Swedish soprano [[Jenny Lind]]. Called ''The Secret Songs'' it was unfinished.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/05/15/uk-costello-idUKTRE54E5WH20090515 |title=Elvis Costello Reveals 'Secret' New Album' |agency=Reuters |first=Gary |last=Graff |date=15 May 2009 |work=Billboard}}</ref> In a performance in 2007 directed by [[Kasper Bech Holten]] at the Opera's studio theatre ([[Takkelloftet|Takelloftet]]), finished songs were interspersed with pieces from Costello's 1993 collaborative classical album ''[[The Juliet Letters]]'', featuring Danish soprano Sine Bundgaard as Lind.

These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the [[Zener cards]] experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a \u201cclosed\u201d ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases likelihood of card counting and in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage. For example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder\u2019s glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could\u2019ve been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next.<ref>Milton, J. & Wiseman, R.

Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clairvoyance]]\n* [[Extrasensory Perception (book)|''Extrasensory Perception'' (book)]]\n* [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]]\n* [[List of psychic abilities]]\n* [[Outline of parapsychology]]\n* [[Remote Viewing]]\n* [[Telepathy]]\n* [[Inner eye]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Georges Charpak]], Henri Broch, and Bart K.

(In economics, \"scale\" is synonymous with quantity.)\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's [[Marginal_cost|marginal cost]] of producing a good or service is beneath its [[Average_cost|average cost]] of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale.\nSome economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a [[Economies of scale#Physical and engineering basis|physical or engineering basis]].\n\nAnother source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to [[Adam Smith]] and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = O'Sullivan\n  | first = Arthur\n  | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n  | first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin\n  | title = Economics: Principles in Action\n  | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n  | date = 2003\n  | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ\n  | pages = 157\n  | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> [[Diseconomies of scale]] are the opposite.\n\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase.  Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, [[pulp and paper industry]]. A common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomical distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently.  They will therefore avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins.  Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity grade production to specialty products.<ref>Manufacture of specialty grades by small scale producers is a common practice in steel, paper and many commodity industries today.

In wholesale and retail distribution, increasing the speed of operations, such as order fulfillment, lowers the cost of both fixed and [[working capital]]. Other common sources of economies of scale are [[Purchase|purchasing]] (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-[[interest]] charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), [[marketing]] (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in [[media market]]s), and technological (taking advantage of [[returns to scale]] in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the [[long run average cost]]s (LRAC) of production by shifting the [[cost curve|short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve]] down and to the right.\n\nEconomies of scale is a practical concept that may explain real-world phenomena such as patterns of international trade or the number of firms in a market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for [[free trade]] policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country\u2014for example, it would not be efficient for [[Liechtenstein]] to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a \"[[natural monopoly]]\". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery. \n\nThe management thinker and translator of the [[Toyota Production System]] for service, Professor [[John Seddon]], argues that attempting to create economies by increasing scale is powered by myth in the service sector. Instead, he believes that economies will come from improving the flow of a service, from the first receipt of a customer\u2019s demand to the eventual satisfaction of that demand. In trying to manage and reduce unit costs, firms often raise total costs by creating [[failure demand]]. Seddon claims that arguments for an economy of scale are a mix of (a) the plausibly obvious and (b) a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/connected_republic/attachments/33/Why_do_we_believe_in_economy_of_scale.pdf|format=PDF|title=Why do we believe in economy of scale? : Professor John Seddon, managing director Vanguard|date=July 2010|website=S3.amazonaws.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Physical and engineering basis==\nSome of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the [[square-cube law]], by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube.  This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.<ref>See various estimating guides, such as Means.  Also see various engineering economics texts related to plant design and construction, etc.</ref>\n\nIn structural engineering, the strength of [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s increases with the cube of the thickness.\n\n[[Drag (physics)|Drag]] loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.\n\nHeat losses from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square-cube law.<ref>The relationship is rather complex.  See engineering texts on heat transfer.</ref>\n\n===Capital and operating cost===\n\nOverall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale.  A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six power rule).<ref>{{ Cite journal\n | last = Moore\n | first =Fredrick T.\n | author1-link =In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to size, output, or scale of operation, with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units of output. Often operational efficiency is also greater with increasing scale, leading to lower variable cost as well. Economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. For example, a large manufacturing facility would be expected to have a lower cost per unit of output than a smaller facility, all other factors being equal, while a company with many facilities should have a cost advantage over a competitor with fewer.

Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or \"stretched\" to increase payload.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=127\u2013128}}</ref>\n\nMany manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity.  This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.\n\n===Economical use of byproducts===\n\n[[Karl Marx]] noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982}}</ref>  Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products.  In the pulp and paper industry it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce [[process steam]] and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.\n\n==Economies of scale and returns to scale==\n\nEconomies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale.  Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has ''constant'' returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are ''decreasing'' if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and ''increasing'' if more than double the output.  If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]], returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function.  Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.\n\nIf the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gelles |first=Gregory M. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Douglas W. |title=Returns to Scale and Economies of Scale: Further Observations |journal=Journal of Economic Education |volume=27 |date=1996 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013261 |jstor=1183297 |doi=10.1080/00220485.1996.10844915}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Frisch |first=R. |authorlink=Ragnar Frisch |title=Theory of Production |location=Dordrecht |publisher=D.

For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels.  Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.\n\nThe literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of [[reverse auction]]s, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.<ref name=\"ShalevAsbjornsen2010\">{{cite journal |last=Shalev |first=Moshe Eitan |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Stee |title=Electronic Reverse Auctions and the Public Sector \u2013 Factors of Success |journal=Journal of Public Procurement |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=428\u2013452 |date=2010 |ssrn=1727409 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, surprisingly enough, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.<ref name=\"ShalevAsbjornsen2010\" />\n\n== Distributional consequences ==\nIn his 1844 ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts]]'', [[Karl Marx]] observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the [[wikt:sophistry|sophistical]] nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:\n\n: As for large landed property, its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large-scale agriculture with large-scale landed property, as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage, for one thing, received its greatest possible extension, and, for another, only then would be of social benefit.<ref name=marx1844>[[Karl Marx]], ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', M. Milligan, trans. (1988), p. 65-66</ref>\n\nInstead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by [[Cooperative|associations]]:\n\n:Association, applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land-division, namely, equality. In the same way association re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom, overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, for the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man.<ref name=marx1844/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Economics}}\n*[[Economies of scope]]\n*[[Ideal firm size]]\n*[[Long tail]]\n*[[Mass production]]\n*[[Network effect]]\n*[[Economies of density]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* F\u00e4re, R., S.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he made [[sexploitation film|sexploitation movies]] and wrote over 80 [[pulp magazine|pulp]] crime, horror and sex novels. In 1975, he was awarded a [[The Golden Turkey Awards|Golden Turkey Award]] as Worst Director of All Time, renewing public interest in his work.{{sfn|Craig|2009|p=276}} Wood's career and [[Camp (style)|camp]] approach has earned him and his films a [[cult following]].\n\nFollowing the publication of [[Rudolph Grey]]'s 1992 oral biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.'', the public took a greater interest in Wood, leading up to director [[Tim Burton]]'s biopic of Wood's life, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), a critically acclaimed film starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Wood that earned two [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Early years==\nWood's father, Edward Sr., worked for the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], where Ed Wood Jr. was born in 1924. According to Wood's second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter.{{sfn|Grey|1994|p=16}} For the rest of his life, Wood [[Cross-dressing|crossdressed]], infatuated with the feel of angora on his skin.{{sfn|Benshoff|1997|p=157}}{{sfn|Weaver|2004|p=358}}\n\nDuring his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comics and [[pulp magazine]]s, and adored movies, most notably [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], serials, and anything involving the [[occult]]. [[Buck Jones]] and [[Bela Lugosi]] were two of his earliest childhood idols. He would often skip school in favor of watching pictures at the local movie theater, where [[film still|stills]] from the day's movie would often be thrown in the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage them to add to his extensive collection.\n\nOn his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] \"Cine Special\". One of his first pieces of footage, and one that imbued him with pride, showed the airship ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' passing over the [[Hudson River]] at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its [[Hindenburg disaster|historic crash]] at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]]. One of Wood's first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. He later fronted a singing quartet called \"Eddie Wood's Little Splinters\", having learned to play a variety of string instruments.\n\n===Military service===\nIn 1942, Wood enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]], just months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Assigned to the 2nd [[Marine defense battalions|Defense Battalions]], he reached the rank of corporal before he was discharged. He was involved in the [[Battle of Tarawa]], among others, and during the war, he lost his two front teeth to a Japanese soldier's rifle butt and was shot several times in the leg by a [[machine gunner]] (shown false in ''The Unknown War of Edward D. Wood Jr.: 1942\u20131946'' by James Pontolillo). Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed.\n\n==Career==\n{{main|Ed Wood filmography}}\n\n===Directing and screenwriting===\nIn 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns with names such as ''[[Crossroads of Laredo]]'' and ''Crossroad Avenger: The Legend of the Tucson Kid''. In 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in ''Casual Company'', a play derived from his unpublished novel, which was based on his service in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25.{{sfn|Grey|1994|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nIn 1952, Wood was introduced to actor [[Bela Lugosi]] by friend and fellow writer-producer [[Alex Gordon (writer-producer)|Alex Gordon]], Wood's roommate at the time, who went on to help create [[American International Pictures]]. Lugosi's son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela Lugosi Jr.]], has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi's stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not refuse any work,<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Thompson, Brett|year=1996 |title=The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr. |medium=Documentary|publisher=Wood-Thomas Pictures}}</ref> while most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'' suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]]. Lugosi had become dependent on [[morphine]] as a way of controlling his debilitating [[sciatica]] over the years, and was in a horrendous physical state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/26050/10-absurd-facts-about-worst-director-all-time|title=10 Absurd Facts About the Worst Director of All Time|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref>\n\nWood billed himself under a number of different pseudonyms, including Ann Gora (in reference to [[Angora rabbit|Angora]] - his favorite female textile) and Akdov Telmig (The backwards form of his favorite drink, the [[Gimlet (cocktail)|vodka gimlet]]).\n\n===''Glen or Glenda''===\nIn 1953 Wood wrote and directed the exploitation semi-documentary film ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (originally titled ''I Changed My Sex!'') with producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]]. The film starred Wood (under the alias \"Daniel Davis\"), his girlfriend [[Dolores Fuller]], and Lugosi (in voiceover) as the god-like narrator. The film, loosely based on transgendered woman [[Christine Jorgensen]], was panned by critics (then and now), and considered one of Wood's worst films, though many others have praised its camp qualities. It is notable for its emphatic and groundbreaking portrayal of [[LGBT]] issues at a time when the media was very hostile to such ideas.\n\n===''Jail Bait''===\nIn 1954, Wood directed and produced a crime film, ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (originally titled ''The Hidden Face''), along with co-writer Alex Gordon, which starred [[Lyle Talbot]] and [[Steve Reeves]] (in one of his first acting jobs). Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy working on another film project when filming started and had to bow out.\n\n===''Bride of the Monster''===\nIn 1955 Wood produced and directed the horror film ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' (originally titled ''Bride of the Atom''), based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he called ''The Atomic Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autry.com/clubhouse/alex/remembrance.html |title=Alex Gordon |publisher=Autry.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> It starred Bela Lugosi, Swedish wrestler [[Tor Johnson]], and [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]].\n\nFollowing the making of the film, Lugosi admitted himself to the state hospital for treatment of his drug addiction.\n\n===''Plan 9 from Outer Space''===\nIn 1956 Wood produced, wrote, and directed the science fiction film ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (originally titled ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''), which starred Lugosi (in his final film role; Lugosi died during production), Tor Johnson, Vampira ([[Maila Nurmi]]), [[Tom Mason]] (who doubled for Lugosi in several scenes), and [[the Amazing Criswell]] as the film's narrator. ''Plan 9'' premiered (as ''Grave Robbers'') at a very small screening in 1957, was only released theatrically under the title ''Plan Nine from Outer Space'' in 1959, and was finally sold to [[Late night television in the United States|late night television]] in 1961, thereby finding its audience over the years.\n\nIt became Wood's best-known film and received a [[cult following]] after 1980, when [[Michael Medved]] declared this film \"[[List of films considered the worst|the worst film ever made]]\" in his book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''.\n\n===''The Violent Years''===\nIn 1956 Wood wrote and produced the exploitation film ''[[The Violent Years]]'' (originally titled ''Teenage Girl Gang'') with director William M. Morgan, starring ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Jean Moorhead]].\n\n===''Night of the Ghouls''===\nIn 1958 Wood wrote, produced, and directed ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]'' (originally titled ''Revenge of the Dead''), starring Kenne Duncan, Tor Johnson (as \"Lobo\" from ''Bride of the Monster''), Criswell, Duke Moore, and Valda Hansen. The film may have been released marginally in March 1959, and then promptly vanished from sight for nearly three decades, when it was resurrected on home video. For many years, it was thought to be a lost film. (Wood also co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Bride and the Beast (film)|The Bride and the Beast]]'' (1958), directed by Adrian Weiss.)\n\n===''The Sinister Urge''===\nIn 1962 Wood wrote and directed the exploitation film ''[[The Sinister Urge (film)|The Sinister Urge]]'' (originally titled ''Racket Queen''), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, and Carl Anthony. Filmed in just five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has [[grindhouse]] elements. The film contains an \"eerily prescient\"{{sfn|Craig|2009|p=208}} scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, \"I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies\". Wood's own career soon spiraled downward into a blur of \"smut racket\" nudie cutie flicks, [[softcore pornography]] and [[X rating|X-rated]] novels and films.\n\nThe scenes of teenagers at a pizza place were shot in 1956 for the unfinished juvenile delinquency film ''Rock and Roll Hell'' (a.k.a. ''Hellborn''). This includes a fight scene performed by Ed Wood (uncredited) and Conrad Brooks.\n\n===''Orgy of the Dead''===\nIn 1963 Wood wrote the screenplay for ''Shotgun Wedding'', an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and the grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]'', originally titled ''Nudie Ghoulies''. Wood handled various production details while [[Stephen C. Apostolof]] directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased ''Night of the Ghouls''. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. ''[[Venus Flytrap (film)|Venus Flytrap]]'' (1970), a US/Japan [[horror film]], was based on an unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.{{sfn|Weldon|1996|p=464}}\n\n===''Necromania''===\nIn 1969, Wood appeared in ''The Photographer'' (a.k.a. ''Love Feast'' or  ''Pretty Models All in a Row''), the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with models. He had a smaller role in Robertson's second film, ''Mrs. Stone's Thing'', as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.\n\nIn 1970, Wood made his own pornographic film, ''[[Take It Out in Trade]]'', a softcore take on [[Philip Marlowe]] detective films. The following year, he produced, wrote, and directed ''[[Necromania]]'' (sometimes subtitled ''A Tale of Weird Love'') under the pseudonym \"Don Miller\". The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic film. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraney's [[Something Weird]] imprint in the late 1980s, then was re-released on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Wood worked with friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually co-writing scripts, but also serving as an assistant director and associate producer. (Together they had made Wood's ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]'' in 1965.) His last known on-screen appearance was in Apostolof's ''Fugitive Girls'' (a.k.a. ''Five Loose Women'') in 1974, where he played both a gas station attendant called \"Pops\" and a sheriff on the women's trail.\n\n===Books and novels===\nBeginning in the early 1960s up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers. Thirty-two stories known to be written by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as \"Ann Gora\" and \"Dr. T.K. Peters\") are collected in ''Blood Splatters Quickly'', published by [[OR Books]] in 2014. Novels include ''Black Lace Drag'' (1963) (reissued in 1965 as ''Killer in Drag''), ''Orgy of the Dead'' (1965), ''Devil Girls'' (1967), ''Death of a Transvestite'' (1967), ''The Sexecutives'' (1968), ''The Photographer'' (1969), ''[[Take It Out in Trade]]'' (1970), ''The Only House in Town'' (1970),  ''[[Necromania]]'' (1971), ''The Undergraduate'' (1972), ''A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies'' (1973) and ''Fugitive Girls'' (1974).\n\nIn ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'', [[Maila Nurmi]] said she declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for the film version of his ''Necromania'', claiming she was recovering from a major stroke at the time.{{sfn|Grey|1994|p=135}}\n\nIn 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-[[memoir]] ''[[Hollywood Rat Race]]'', which was eventually published in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to \"just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll get better\", and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub [[cabaret]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationships and marriages===\nWood had a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter [[Dolores Fuller]], whom he met in late 1952. The two lived together for a time and Wood cast Fuller in three of his films: ''Glen or Glenda'', ''Jail Bait'', and ''Bride of the Monster''. Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a [[crossdresser]] and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman in ''Glen or Glenda''. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress in the lead role of ''Bride of the Monster'' (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller and reduced her part to a 1-minute cameo) and because of Wood's excessive drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/11/local/la-me-dolores-fuller-20110511|title=Dolores Fuller dies at 88; actress dated director Ed Wood|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=May 11, 2011|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhile making ''Bride of the Monster'' in late 1955, Wood married Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, the airplane stewardess in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''. The marriage was annulled in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/norma-mccarty-dead-1201285478/|title=Norma McCarty, Actress and Wife of Ed Wood, Dies at 93|last=Holman|first=Jordyn|date=August 18, 2014|publisher=variety.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWood married his second wife, Kathy O'Hara, in 1959.

Wood Jr.'', Wood's wife Kathy recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls' clothing as a child.{{sfn|Grey|1994|p=16}} Kathy stated that Wood's transvestism was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from [[Angora wool|angora]] fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood's films).{{sfn|Grey|1994|p=141}} Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as Shirley, his female alter ego (who also appeared in many of his screenplays and stories).{{sfn|Craig|2009|p=108}}\n\n==Death==\nBy 1978, Wood's depression had worsened, and he and his wife Kathy had both become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend, actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking [[vodka]]. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink, which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, \"Kathy, I can't breathe!\", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement in the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a [[heart attack]]. Kathy later said, \"I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell\".{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=81}}\n\nWood was [[Cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were scattered at sea.{{sfn|Grey|1994|p=160}}\n\n==Legacy and homages==\nIn 1986 in an essay paying homage to Wood in ''[[Incredibly Strange Films]]'', Jim Morton wrote: \"Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a man born to film. Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat\".{{sfn|Morton|1986|p=158}}\n\nIn 1994 director Tim Burton released the biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]] in the title role and [[Martin Landau]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]] for [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]. [[Conrad Brooks]] appeared in the movie, in a cameo role of Barman. The film received mass critical acclaim, but did poorly at the box office. It has since developed a [[cult following]].\n\nIn 1996 Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-steve-galindo/ioh-my-godi-god-is-the-pr_b_362417.html | title=Oh My God?: God Is the Producer of Our Lives But We Are the Directors | date=November 18, 2009| publisher=Huffpost Entertainment}}</ref> Founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts more than 3,500 baptized followers.

Producers of ''MST3K'' considered including ''Plan 9'', but found it had too much dialogue for the show's format.\n\nIn 1998, Wood's previously unfilmed script ''[[I Woke Up Early the Day I Died]]'' was finally produced, starring [[Billy Zane]] and [[Christina Ricci]], with appearances by [[Tippi Hedren]], [[Bud Cort]], [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Karen Black]], [[John Ritter]] and many others. Outside of a brief New York theatrical engagement, the film did not receive a commercial release in the United States, and was only available on video in Germany due to contractual difficulties.\n\nIn 2001, horror film director and heavy metal musician [[Rob Zombie]] released ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'', which is titled after [[The Sinister Urge (film)|Wood's film]].\n\nIn 2002, American horror-punk supergroup [[Murderdolls]] released the album ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls]]'', which features the single \"Dead in Hollywood\" and makes a reference to Wood with the lyrics, \"You can knock on Ed Wood, but it won't do you no good/Cause all of my heroes are dead in Hollywood.\"\n\nIn 2005, the ''Plan 9'' cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series ''[[Deadly Cinema]]''; the following year, clips of this episode were featured in the documentary ''Vampira: The Movie''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vampirathemovie.com/cast.php |title=Cast of Vampira: The Movie |publisher=Vampirathemovie.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, ''MST3K'' head writer and host [[Michael J.

This exhaustive two-hour documentary by Mark Patrick Carducci chronicles the making of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' and features interviews with Maila Nurmi (Vampira), Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, et al. In 2000, Image Entertainment included the documentary on the DVD reissue of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' (in a two-disc set with ''[[Robot Monster]]'').\n* ''Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora'', released in 1994 by [[Rhino Home Video]], is a one-hour documentary on Wood's life and films. This includes rare outtakes and interviews with Dolores Fuller, Kathy Wood, Stephen Apostolof, and Conrad Brooks.  [[Gary Owens]] narrates; [[Ted Newsom]] wrote and directed.\n* ''The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr.'', written and directed by Brett Thompson, came out in 1995. This documentary about the life and films of Ed Wood features interviews with Wood's friends and co-workers and closely resembles Wood's own style, albeit with slightly better miniatures.\n* ''The Incredibly Strange Film Show'' presented by ''Jonathan Ross''.\n\n==Lost films==\nWood's 1972 film ''The Undergraduate'' is considered to be a [[lost film]], as was his 1970 film ''Take It Out in Trade''.

It was one of the first attempts to establish a neutral data exchange format for the [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) industry. The goal was to establish a common format from which the proprietary formats of the EDA systems could be derived. When customers needed to transfer data from one system to another, it was necessary to write translators from one format to other. As the number of formats (''N'') multiplied, the translator issue became an ''N''-squared problem. The expectation was that with EDIF the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems.\n\nRepresentatives of the EDA companies [[Daisy Systems]], [[Mentor Graphics]], [[Motorola]], [[National Semiconductor]], [[Tektronix]], [[Texas Instruments]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] established the ''EDIF Steering Committee'' in November 1983. Later [[Hilary Kahn]], a computer science professor at the [[University of Manchester]], joined the team and led the development from version EDIF 2 0 0 till the final version 4 0 0.\n\n== Syntax ==\n\nThe general format of EDIF involves using parentheses to delimit data definitions, and in this way it superficially resembles [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords (like ''library'', ''cell'', ''instance'', etc.), strings (delimited with double quotes), integer numbers, symbolic constants (e.g. ''GENERIC'', ''TIE'', ''RIPPER'' for cell types) and \"Identifiers\", which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters. \nEDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using  keywords instead.\nSo, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this: \n<source lang=\"lisp\">\n(edif fibex  (edifVersion 2 0 0)\n  (edifLevel 0) (keywordMap (keywordLevel 0))\n  (status (written (timeStamp 1995 1 1 1 1 1) (program \"xxx\" (version \"v1\"))))\n  (library xxx (edifLevel 0)\n    (technology (numberDefinition (scale 1 (e 1 -6) (unit distance))))\n    (cell dff_4 (cellType generic)\n      (view view1 (viewType netlist)\n        (interface\n          (port aset (direction INPUT))\n          (port clok (direction INPUT))\n    ...\n    (cell yyy (cellType generic)\n      (view schematic_ (viewType netlist)\n        (interface\n          (port CLEAR (direction INPUT))\n          (port CLOCK (direction INPUT)) ... )\n        (contents\n           (instance I_36_1 (viewRef view1 (cellRef dff_4)))\n           (instance (rename I_36_3 \"I$3\") (viewRef view1 (cellRef addsub_4)))\n           ...\n           (net CLEAR\n             (joined\n               (portRef CLEAR)\n                 (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_1))\n                 (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_3))))\n    ...\n</source>\n\n== Versions ==\n\nThe 1 0 0 release of EDIF was made in 1985.\n\n=== EDIF 2 0 0 ===\nThe first \"real\" public release of EDIF was version 2 0 0, which was approved in March 1988 as the standard ANSI/EIA-548-1988. It is published in a single volume. This version has no formal [[scope statement]] but what it tries to capture is covered by the defined '''viewType'''s:\n* ''BEHAVIOR to describe the behavior of a cell''\n* ''DOCUMENT to describe the documentation of a cell''\n* ''GRAPHIC to describe a ''dumb'' graphics and text representation of displayable or printable information''\n* ''LOGICMODEL to describe the logic-simulation model of the cell''\n* ''MASKLAYOUT to describe an integrated circuit layout''\n* ''NETLIST to describe a netlist''\n* ''PCBLAYOUT to describe a printed circuit board''\n* ''SCHEMATIC to describe the schematic representation and connectivity of a cell''\n* ''STRANGER to describe an as yet unknown representation of a cell''\n* ''SYMBOLIC to describe a symbolic layout''\nThe industry tested this release for several years, but finally only the NETLIST view was the one widely used and some EDA tools are still supporting it today for EDIF 2 0 0. \n\nTo overcome problems with the main 2 0 0 standard several further documents got released:\n* Electronic Industries Association\n** ''EDIF Monograph Series, Volume 1, Introduction to EDIF'', EIA/EDIF-1, Sept. 1988\n** ''EDIF Monograph Series, Volume 2, EDIF Connectivity'', EIA/EDIF-2, June 1989\n** ''Using EDIF 2 0 0 for schematic transfer'', EIA/EDIF/AG-1, July 1989\n* Documentation from Hilary J. Kahn, Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester\n** ''EDIF 2 0 0, An Introductory Tutorial\", September 1989\n** ''EDIF Questions and answers, volume one'', November 1988\n** ''EDIF Questions and answers, volume two'', February 1989\n** ''EDIF Questions and answers, volume three'', July 1989\n** ''EDIF Questions and answers, volume four'', November 1989\n** ''EDIF Questions and answers, volume five'', June 1991\n\n=== EDIF 3 0 0 ===\nBecause of some fundamental weaknesses in the 2 0 0 release a new not compatible release 3 0 0 was released in September 1993,  given the designation of [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]] standard EIA-618. It later achieved [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] designations. It is published in 4 volumes. The main focus of this version were the viewTypes NETLIST and SCHEMATIC from 2 0 0. MASKLAYOUT, PCBLAYOUT and some other views were dropped from this release and shifted for later releases because the work for these views was not fully completed.\n\nEDIF 3 0 0 is available from the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] as IEC 61690-1\n\n=== EDIF 4 0 0 ===\nEDIF 4 0 0 was released in late August 1996, mainly to add \"Printed Circuit Board\" extensions (the original PCBLAYOUT view) to EDIF 3 0 0. This more than doubled the size of EDIF 3 0 0, and is published in HTML format on CD.\n\nEDIF 4 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as [[IEC 61690-2]]\n\n== Evolution ==\n=== Problems with 2 0 0 ===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}\n\nTo understand the problems users and vendors encountered with EDIF 2 0 0, one first has to picture all the elements and dynamics of the electronics industry. The people who needed this standard were mainly design engineers, who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers. These engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s, and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically. The first suppliers were Electronic Design Automation vendors (e.g., Daisy, Mentor, and Valid formed the earliest predominating set). These companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market.\n\nOne of the tactics used by these companies to \"capture\" their customers was their proprietary databases. Each had special features that the others did not. Once a decision was made to use a particular vendor's software to enter a design, the customer was ever after constrained to use no other software. To move from vendor A's to vendor B's systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system. This expense of \"migration\" was the main factor that locked design engineers into using a single vendor.\n\nBut the \"customers\" had a different desire. They saw immediately that while vendor A might have a really nice analog simulation environment, vendor B had a much better PCB or silicon layout auto-router. And they wished that they could pick and choose amongst the different vendors.\n\nEDIF was mainly supported by the electronics design end-users, and their companies. The EDA vendors were involved also, but their motivation was more along the lines of wanting to not alienate their customers. Most of the EDA vendors produced EDIF 2 0 0 translators, but they were definitely more interested in generating high-quality EDIF readers, and they had absolutely no motivation at all to write any software that generated EDIF (an EDIF Writer), beyond threats from customers of mass migration to another vendor's software.\n\nThe result was rather interesting. Hardly any software vendor wrote EDIF 2 0 0 output that did not have severe violations of syntax or semantics. The semantics were just loose enough that there might be several ways to describe the same data. This began to be known as \"flavors\" of EDIF. The vendor companies did not always feel it important to allocate many resources to EDIF products, even if they sold a large number of them. There were several stories of active products with virtually no-one to maintain them for years. User complaints were merely gathered and prioritized. The harder it became to export customer data to EDIF, the more the vendors seemed to like it. Those who did write EDIF translators found they spent a huge amount of time and effort on generating sufficiently powerful, forgiving, artificially intelligent readers, that could handle and piece together the poor-quality code produced by the extant EDIF 2 0 0 writers of the day.\n\nIn designing EDIF 3 0 0, the committees were well aware of the faults of the language, the calumny heaped on EDIF 2 0 0 by the vendors and the frustration of the end users. So, to tighten the semantics of the language, and provide a more formal description of the standard, the revolutionary approach was taken to provide an information model for EDIF, in the information modeling language [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]]. This helped to better document the standard, but was done more as an afterthought, as the syntax crafting was done independently of the model, instead of being generated from the model. Also, even though the standard says that if the syntax and model disagree, the model is the standard, this is not the case in practice. The [[Backus-Naur form|BNF]] description of the syntax is the foundation of the language inasmuch as the software that does the day-to-day work of producing design descriptions is based on a fixed syntax. The information model also suffered from the fact that it was not (and is not) ideally suited to describing EDIF. It does not describe such concepts as name spaces very well at all, and the differences between a definition and a reference is not clearly describable either. Also, the constructs in EXPRESS for describing constraints might be formal, but constraint description is a fairly complicated matter at times. So, most constraints ended up just being described as comments. Most of the others became elaborate formal descriptions which most readers will never be able to decipher, and therefore may not stand up to automated debugging/compiling, just as a program might look good in review, but a compiler might find some interesting errors, and actually running the program written might find even more interesting errors. (Additionally, analogous EXPRESS compilers/executors didn't exist when the standard was written, and may not still exist today!)\n\n=== Solutions to EDIF 2 0 0 problems ===\n\nThe solution to the \"flavor\" problem of EDIF 2 0 0 was to develop a more specific semantic description in EDIF 3 0 0 (1993). Indeed, reported results of people generating EDIF 3 0 0 translators was that the writers were now ''much'' more difficult to get right, due to the great number of semantic restrictions, and the readers are comparatively trivial to develop.\n\nThe solution to vendor \"conflict of interest\" was neutral third-party companies, who could provide EDIF products based on vendor interfaces. This separation of the EDIF products from direct vendor control was critical to providing the end-user community with tools that worked well. It formed naturally and without comment. [[Engineering DataXpress]] was perhaps the first such company in this realm, with [[Electronic Tools Company]] seeming to have captured the market in the mid to late 1990s. Another dynamic in this industry is EDIF itself. Since they have grown to a rather large size, generating readers and writers has become a very expensive proposition. Usually the third-party companies have congregated the necessary specialists and can use this expertise to more efficiently generate the software. They are also able to leverage code sharing and other techniques an individual vendor could not.  By 2000, almost no major vendor produced its own EDIF tools, choosing instead to [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] third-party tools. \n\nSince the release of EDIF 4 0 0, the entire EDIF standards organisation has essentially dissolved. There have been no published meetings of any of the technical subcommittees, the EDIF Experts group, etc. Most of the individuals involved have moved on to other companies or efforts. The newsletter was abandoned, and the Users' Group no longer holds yearly meetings. EDIF 3 0 0 and 4 0 0 are now [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and European (EN) standards.  EDIF Version 3 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-1, and EDIF Version 4 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-2.\n\n=== EDIF Descendants ===\n* [[LKSoft]] took concepts from EDIF 2 0 0 to create a proprietary data format with the default extension \".cam\" for their '''CircuitCAM''' system offered by [[LPKF Laser & Electronics AG]]. To efficiently work on EDIF like formats LKSoft has developed the ''EDIF Procedural Interface'', an API for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].\n* [[Zuken]], formerly Racal-Redac Ltd., took concepts from the early EDIF 4 0 0 development to create a new proprietary format called CADIF for their '''Visula''' PCB-CAD system. This format is also widely used by 3rd party vendors.\n* STEP-AP210, a part of [[ISO 10303]], practically inherited all of the EDIF 4 0 0 functionality except for schematics.\n\n==See also==\n*[[gedif]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://reliability.ee.byu.edu/edif BYU EDIF Tools] A Java framework for parsing/manipulating EDIF files, developed and maintained by [[BYU]]'s Configurable Computing Lab\n* [http://torc.isi.edu Torc] Open-source C++ API for reconfigurable computing, including parsing and manipulation of EDIF 2 0 0, from [http://www.isi.edu ISI]'s Reconfigurable Computing Group\n* [http://www.elgris.com/content/edif_overview.html EDIF Overview] from Elgris Technologies, Inc.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060101191742/http://www.edif.org/ www.edif.org at the Internet Archive] Archive of www.edif.org (now defunct) containing an introduction to the EDIF format\n* [http://www.rulabinsky.com/cavd/text/chapd.html Computer Aids for VLSI Design - Appendix D: Electronic Design Interchange Format by Steven M.

According to the text it was written by [[Enos (Book of Mormon)|Enos]], a [[Nephite]] prophet.\n\nThe short book consists of a single chapter and relates Enos' conversion after praying all day and all night, and his subsequent dialogue with the Lord.  It also discusses the [[salvation|redemption]] of the Nephites and their enemies, the [[Lamanite]]s.<ref>http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/enos-son-of-jacob?lang=eng&letter=e</ref> The narrative of the Book of Enos is often used in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as an example of faith.<ref>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/10/finding-faith-in-the-lord-jesus-christ?lang=eng&query=book+of+enos</ref>\n\n== Narrative ==\n\nOne time Enos was hunting in the woods and he remembered the gospel according to his father, and he got on his knees and cried all day and into the night for the salvation of his soul. Then the voice of God told Enos that his sins were forgiven.  Enos believed the voice, but he was curious about how the forgiveness was actually accomplished.  God told Enos he was forgiven because he had faith in Christ, even though he never heard or saw Christ, and indeed it would be far in the future before he came in the flesh.\n\nEnos then prayed for the salvation of the Nephites, but God said they would be blessed or cursed according to how they obeyed the commandments.  Enos, fearing that the Nephites would refuse to obey the commandments of God, then prayed for the Lamanites who oppressed them, that at least they would avoid destruction. And he prayed that God would preserve a record of the Nephites so that someday the Lamanites too might be brought to salvation, even though anything the Nephites said and did now in Enos' time would have nothing to do with salvation on that future day, but only faith in Christ, whose death and resurrection would be in the past instead of the future. Nevertheless, God made a covenant with Enos that he would bring the records of the Nephites to the Lamanites in due time.\n\nEnos took up the mantle of prophet and went among his people the Nephites lest they be destroyed as God had warned. Enos does not say whether he was successful at converting the Nephites back to the true faith, but he does say the Nephites failed to convert the Lamanites back to the true faith.\n\nHe characterized the Lamanites as having a hatred that was fixed. The Lamanites were led by their evil nature to become a wild and bloodthirsty people. They were full of idolatry and filthiness and fed upon beasts of prey.  They dwelt in tents, wandered about in the wilderness, wore a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads were shaven.  Their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. Many of them ate nothing except raw meat. They were continually seeking to destroy the Nephites who tilled the land, grew fruit in orchards, and tended flocks of cattle and goats and horses.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Book of Mormon]]\n\n{{Portal|Book of Mormon}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{wikisource-inline|Book of Mormon/Enos|Book of Enos}}\n* [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos ''The Book of Enos'' from the official website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]\n\n[[Category:Books of the Book of Mormon|Enos]]", "sha1": "mllxw7k6au8aqoqrrtvuug54jod4ua2"}}, {"title": "Environmental skepticism", "ns": "0", "id": "10530", "revision": {"id": "847094430", "parentid": "846757729", "timestamp": "2018-06-22T22:00:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shortsword", "id": "29982132"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Three minor spelling/grammar fixes, and an added Wikilink", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Environmental skepticism''' is the belief that claims by [[environmentalism|environmentalists]], and the [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] who support them, are false or exaggerated.<ref name=\"DryzekNorgaard2011\">{{cite book|author1=John S.

Unlike woodwind instruments with [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]], a flute is an [[aerophone]] or [[reedless wind instrument]] that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]], flutes are categorized as [[edge-blown aerophones]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = edge-blown aerophone - OnMusic Dictionary|url = http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/1278-edge-blown_aerophone|website = OnMusic Dictionary|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}<!--Cited source does not mention the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system at all. In any case, this citation belongs somewhere in the body of the text, not in the lede, which should only summarize what is in the text, not present otherwise unsupported material.--> A [[musician]] who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.\n\nFlutes are the [[paleolithic flutes|earliest extant musical instruments]], as paleolithic instruments with hand-bored holes have been found. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the [[Swabian Jura]] region of present-day [[Germany]]. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{Cite journal| last = Wilford  | first = John N.| title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music | laysource = The New York Times | volume =459| issue =   7244| pages =  248\u201352| date = June 24, 2009  | laysummary = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html| pmid = 19444215| doi = 10.1038/nature07995 |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..248C | journal = Nature }}.

After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the [[whistle]], [[gemshorn]], [[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[tin whistle]], [[tonette]], [[fujara]], and [[ocarina]] have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a \"[[fipple]]\"). These are known as '''fipple flutes'''. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.\n\nAnother division is between '''side-blown''' (or '''[[transverse flute|transverse]]''') flutes, such as the Western concert flute, [[piccolo]], [[fife (musical instrument)|fife]], [[dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]] and [[bansuri]]; and '''[[end-blown flute]]s''', such as the [[ney]], [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[kaval]], [[danso]], [[shakuhachi]], [[Anasazi flute]] and [[quena]]. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], which are also played [[Vertical flute|vertically]] but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.\n\nFlutes may be open at one or both ends. The [[ocarina]], [[Xun (instrument)|xun]], [[pan pipes]], [[police whistle]], and [[bosun's whistle]] are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.\n\nFlutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple [[Acoustic resonance#Resonance of a tube of air|resonators]] may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).\n\nFlutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use [[nose flute]]s. The [[flue pipe]]s of [[Pipe organ|organs]], which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.\n\n===Western transverse flutes===\n{{Main article|Western concert flute}}\n[[File:Flute with musicial notes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Western concert flute]]]]\n\n====Wooden one-keyed transverse flute====\nUsually in D, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such the instrument is often indicated as [[baroque flute]]. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the [[historically informed performance]] practice.\n\n====Western concert flute====\n[[File:Western concert flute.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|An illustration of a [[Western concert flute]]]]\nThe [[Western concert flute]], a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An ''[[embouchure]] hole'' is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's [[Range (music)|range]] were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by [[Theobald Boehm]] and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors.<ref>[[Theobald Boehm|Boehm, Theobald]]. (1964). ''The Flute and Flute-Playing in Acoustical, Technical, and Artistic Aspects'', translated by Dayton C. Miller, with a new introduction by Samuel Baron. New York: Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-21259-9}}, pp.  8\u201312.</ref> With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the [[Boehm system]]. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually [[African Blackwood]].\n\nThe standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three [[octave]]s starting from [[middle C]] or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means the concert flute is one of the highest common [[orchestra]] and [[concert band]] instruments.\n\n====Western concert flute variants====\n[[File:Joueuse de fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry.jpg|thumb|right|Center: Piccolo. Right: larger flute]]\nThe [[piccolo]] plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute.  Lower members of the flute family include the [[Alto flute|G alto]] and [[Bass flute|C bass]] flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The [[Contrabass flute|contrabass]], [[Double contrabass flute|double contrabass]], and [[Hyperbass flute|hyperbass]] are other rare forms of the flute pitched two, three, and four octaves below middle C respectively.\n\nOther sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the treble G flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D{{music|flat}} piccolo, [[soprano flute]] (the primary instrument, equivalent to today's concert C flute), F alto flute, and B{{music|flat}} bass flute.\n\n===Indian flutes===\n{{Further information|Bansuri|Venu}}\n[[File:Indian bamboo flute.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] eight-holed bamboo flute]]\n\n[[File:Eight Flute1.JPG|thumb|An eight-holed classical Indian bamboo flute.]]\n\nThe bamboo flute is an important instrument in [[Indian classical music]], and developed independently of the Western flute.

The second, the [[Venu]] or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the [[Carnatic music]] of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists.

Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a ''[[di mo]]'', which is usually a thin tissue paper.  It gives the flute a bright sound.\n\nCommonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (\u6886\u7b1b), qudi (\u66f2\u7b1b), xindi (\u65b0\u7b1b), and dadi (\u5927\u7b1b).

The object of the game is to [[Scoring in association football|score]] by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. \n\nAssociation football is one of a family of [[Football|football codes]], which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] were originally codified in England by [[The Football Association]].\n\nPlayers are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] within the [[penalty area]]. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into [[extra time]] or a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] depending on the format of the competition. Association football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA; {{lang-fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association}}), which organises World Cups for both [[FIFA World Cup|men]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women]] every four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0%2C3509%2C10%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Etymology|Names}}\n\n== Name ==\n{{Main article|Names for association football}}\n<!--\nKeep this overview section streamlined!

The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=0-415-35018-2}}</ref> which led to formation of a [[Sheffield & Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867.

The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.<ref name=\"FAhistory\"/> These rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia.

Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play.

These colours were first introduced at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and used consistently since.}}\nA [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \"penal fouls\", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].<ref name=\"fouls\"/>\n\nThe referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \"booked\", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \"unsporting behaviour\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.<ref name=\"fouls\"/>\n\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005}}</ref> The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \"a few seconds\".

Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.<ref name=FAsuspensions>For example, see [[The Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web|title=DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref> Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.{{efn|For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] for [[Luis Su\u00e1rez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]]}} Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.<ref name=FAsuspensions/>\n\nSanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [[English Football League]]  deduct 12 points from any team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Football League administration penalty raised to 12 points|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}</ref> Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture.

The countries that benefited most were the [[Soviet Bloc]] countries of [[Eastern Europe]], where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Games]], the [[IOC]] decided to admit professional players. [[FIFA]] still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and [[CONCACAF]] to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting [[UEFA]] and [[CONMEBOL]] teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad.

It was the corporate successor to his earlier Greater New York Film Rental Company and Box Office Attractions Film Company.\n\nThe company's first film studios were set up in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] but in 1917, William Fox sent [[Sol M. Wurtzel]] to [[Hollywood, California]] to oversee the studio's new [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] production facilities where a more hospitable and cost effective climate existed for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, the company bought the [[patent]]s of the [[Movietone sound system]] for recording sound on to [[film]].\n\nAfter the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Crash of 1929]], William Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney Kent, the new owners merged the company with [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] to form [[20th Century Fox]] in 1935.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] entered the film industry in 1904 when he purchased a one-third share of a [[Brooklyn]] [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] for $1,667.{{efn|${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1667|1904}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars}}{{sfn|Solomon|2011|pp=10\u201311}} He reinvested his profits from that initial location, expanding to fifteen similar venues in the city, and purchasing [[film print|prints]] from the major studios of the time: [[Biograph Studios|Biograph]], [[Essanay]], [[Kalem]], [[Lubin Manufacturing Company|Lubin]], [[Path\u00e9]], [[Selig Polyscope Company|Selig]], and [[Vitagraph]].{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=11}} After experiencing further success presenting live [[vaudeville]] routines along with motion pictures, he expanded into larger venues beginning with his purchase of the disused Gaiety theater,{{efn|Unrelated to the [[Broadway theatre]] operating at the same time, also called the [[Gaiety Theatre (New York City)|Gaiety]]}} and continuing with acquisitions throughout New York City and New Jersey, including the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]].{{sfn|Solomon|2011|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nFox invested further in the film industry by founding the Greater New York Film Rental Company as a [[film distributor]].{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=12}} However, the major film studios formed the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] in 1908 and the [[General Film Company]] in 1910, in an effort to create a [[monopoly]] on the creation and distribution of motion pictures. Fox refused to sell out to the monopoly, and sued under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], eventually receiving a $370,000{{efn|${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|370000|1913}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars}} settlement, and ending restrictions on the length of films and the prices that could be paid for screenplays.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=12}}\n\nIn 1914, reflecting the broader scope of his business, he renamed it the Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=13}} He entered into a contract with the [[Balboa Amusement Producing Company]] film studio, purchasing all of their films for showing in his New York area theaters and renting the prints to other exhibitors nationwide.{{sfn|Slide|2001|pp=26\u201327}} He also continued to distribute material from other sources, such as [[Winsor McCay]]'s early animated film ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=182}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=112}} Later that year, Fox concluded that depending on other companies for the products he depended on was insufficient. He purchased the [[\u00c9clair (company)|\u00c9clair]] studio facilities in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], along with property in [[Staten Island]],{{sfn|Golden|1996|p=30}}{{sfn|Shepherd|2013|p=197}} and arranged for actors and crew. The company became a film studio, with its name shortened to the Box Office Attractions Company; its first release was ''[[Life's Shop Window]]''.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|pp=14, 227}}\n\n===Fox Film Corporation===\n[[File:Fox-Stage-1918-1.jpg|thumb|This large stage at the Fox Studio on North Western Avenue was used as the men's dressing room when more than 2,000 people were needed for the Jerusalem street scenes in [[Theda Bara]]'s ''[[Salom\u00e9 (1918 film)|Salom\u00e9]]'' (1918)]]\n[[File:The Heart Snatcher - Roy Del Ruth - 1920, Fox Film Corporation - EYE FLM6884 - OB 685715.ogv|thumb|Silent film ''The Heart Snatcher'' (1920) directed by [[Roy Del Ruth]] for Fox Film Corporation.]]\nAlways more of an entrepreneur than a showman, Fox concentrated on acquiring and building theaters; pictures were secondary.

The company leased the [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale]] studio of the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] until its own studio, located at Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, was completed in 1916.<ref>{{cite book |last=Slide |first=Anthony |date=1998 |title=The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Scarecrow Press |pages=78\u201379 |isbn=0-8108-3426-X |author-link=Anthony Slide }}</ref> In 1917, William Fox sent [[Sol M. Wurtzel]] to Hollywood to oversee the studio's [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] production facilities where a more hospitable and cost-effective climate existed for filmmaking.\n\nWith the introduction of sound technology, Fox moved to acquire the rights to a [[sound-on-film]] process. In the years 1925\u201326, Fox purchased the rights to the work of [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], the U.S. rights to the [[Tri-Ergon]] system invented by three German inventors, and the work of [[Theodore Case]]. This resulted in the [[Movietone sound system]] later known as \"Fox Movietone\" developed at the [[Movietone Studio]]. Later that year, the company began offering films with a music-and-effects track, and the following year Fox began the weekly ''[[Fox Movietone News]]'' feature, that ran until 1963. The growing company needed space, and in 1926 Fox acquired<span style=\"white-space:nowrap\"> 300&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(1.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>)</span> in the open country west of Beverly Hills and built \"Movietone City\", the best-equipped studio of its time.\n\n===Decline===\nWhen rival [[Marcus Loew]] died in 1927, Fox offered to buy the Loew family's holdings. Loew's Inc. controlled more than 200 theaters, as well as the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] studio. When the family agreed to the sale, the merger of Fox and Loew's Inc. was announced in 1929. But MGM studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] was not included in the deal and fought back. Using political connections, Mayer called on the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[antitrust]] unit to delay giving final approval to the merger.  Fox was badly injured in a car crash in the summer of 1929, and by the time he recovered he had lost most of his fortune in the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|fall 1929 stock market crash]], ending any chance of the merger going through even without the Justice Department's objections.\n\nOverextended and close to bankruptcy, Fox was stripped of his empire in 1930 and ended up in jail for later [[bribery]] charges. Fox Film, with more than 500 theatres, was placed in receivership. A bank-mandated reorganization propped the company up for a time, but it soon became apparent that despite its size, Fox could not stand on its own. William Fox resented the way he was forced out of the company and portrayed it as an active conspiracy against him in the 1933 book ''[[Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox]]''.\n\n===Merger===\n{{main|20th Century Fox}}\nUnder new president Sidney Kent, the new owners began negotiating with the upstart, but powerful independent Twentieth Century Pictures in the early spring of 1935.  The two companies merged that spring as [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] (50 years later, the hyphen was dropped).  For many years, 20th Century Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915.  For instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary.  However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, even though most film historians agree it was founded in 1915.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2010/02/10/is-fox-really-75-this-year-somewhere-the-fantastic-mr-william-fox-begs-to-differ Is Fox really 75 this year?

''[[Fox News (1919\u20131930)|Fox News]]'' premiered on 11 October 1919, with subsequent issues released on the Wednesday and Sunday of each week. ''Fox News'' gained an advantage over its more established competitors when President [[Woodrow Wilson]] endorsed the newsreel in a letter, in what may have been the first time an American president commented on a film.{{sfn|Fielding|2011|p=60}} In subsequent years, ''Fox News'' remained one of the major names in the newsreel industry by providing often-exclusive coverage of major international events, including reporting on [[Pancho Villa]], the airship ''[[Roma (airship)|Roma]]'', the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and a 1922 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].{{sfn|Fielding|2011|p=61}} The silent newsreel series continued until 1930.<ref name=Wilsbacher />\n\nIn 1926, a subsidiary, Fox Movietone Corporation, was created, tasked with producing newsreels using Fox's recently acquired sound-on-film technology. The first of these newsreels debuted on 21 January 1927. Four months later, the 25 May release of a sound recording of [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s departure on his [[transatlantic flight]] was described by film historian Raymond Fielding as the \"first sound news film of consequence\".{{sfn|Fielding|2011|pp=102\u2013104}} ''[[Movietone News]]'' was launched as a regular newsreel feature 3 December of that year.{{sfn|Fielding|2011|p=105}} Production of the series continued after the merger with Twentieth Century Pictures, until 1963, and continued to serve 20th Century Fox after that, as a source for film industry stock footage.<ref name=Wilsbacher />\n\nUnlike Fox's early feature films, the ''Fox News'' and ''Fox Movietone News'' libraries have largely survived. The earlier series and some parts of its sound successor are now held by the [[University of South Carolina]], with the remaining ''Fox Movietone News'' still held by the company.<ref name=Wilsbacher />\n\n===Serials===\nFox Film briefly experimented with [[serial film]]s, releasing the 15-episode ''[[Bride 13]]'' and the 20-episode ''[[Fant\u00f4mas (1920 serial)|Fant\u00f4mas]]'' in 1920. William Fox was unwilling to compromise on production quality in order to make serials profitable, however, and none were subsequently produced.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=57}}\n\n===Short films===\nHundreds of one- and two-reel [[short films]] of various types were also produced by Fox. Beginning in 1916,{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=23}} the [[Sunshine Comedy]] division created two-reel [[comedy film|comedy]] shorts. Many of these, beginning with 1917's ''[[Roaring Lions and Wedding Bliss]]'', starring [[Lloyd Hamilton]], were [[slapstick]], intended to compete with [[Mack Sennett]]'s popular offerings.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|pp=30\u201331}} Sunshine releases continued until the introduction of sound.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|pp=49\u201350}} Other short film series included ''Imperial Comedies'', ''Van Bibber Comedies'' (with [[Earle Foxe]]), ''O'Henry'', ''Married Life of Helen and Warren'', and ''Fox Varieties''.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=71}} Fox's expansion into Spanish-language films in the early 1930s also included shorts.{{sfn|Solomon|2011|p=145}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=FtLeeFilmComm>{{Cite web |title=Studios and Films |work= |publisher=Fort Lee Film Commission |date= |url=http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425014840/http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html |archivedate= April 25, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>\n<ref name=FtLeeFilmComm2>{{Cite book |author=Fort Lee Film Commission |title=Fort Lee Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C |isbn=0-7385-4501-5}}</ref>\n<ref name=Koszarski>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Koszarski |title=Fort Lee: The Film Town |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w0r8YKan04C |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-86196-652-X}}</ref>\n<ref name=Pierce>{{cite journal |author-last=Pierce |author-first=David |title=The Legion of the Condemned \u2014 Why American Silent Films Perished |journal=Film History |volume=9 |issue=1 |pp=5\u201322}}</ref>\n<ref name=Wilsbacher>{{cite web |author-last=Wilsbacher |author-first=Greg |title=The Fox Movietone News Donation: A Brief History |website=Moving Image Research Collections |publisher=University of South Carolina |url=http://library.sc.edu/mirc/foxhistory.php |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226120119/http://library.sc.edu/mirc/foxhistory.php |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |author-last=Canemaker |author-first=John |title=Winsor McCay: His Life and Art |edition=Revised |year=2005 |publisher=Abrams Books |isbn=978-0-8109-5941-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Crafton |author-first=Donald |title=Before Mickey: The Animated Film 1898\u20131928 |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-11667-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Fielding |author-first=Raymond |title=The American Newsreel: A Complete History, 1911\u20131967 |edition=2nd |year=2011 |origyear=1972 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-6610-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Golden |author-first=Eve |title=Vamp: The Rise and Fall of Theda Bara |year=1996 |publisher=Vestal Press |isbn=978-1-879511-32-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Shepherd |author-first=David J. |title=The Bible on Silent Film: Spectacle, Story and Scripture in the Early Cinema |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-04260-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Slide |author-first=Anthony |title=The New Historical Dictionary of the American Film Industry |edition=2nd |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-1-57886-015-9 |year=2001 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-last=Solomon |author-first=Aubrey |title=The Fox Film Corporation, 1915\u20131935: A History and Filmography |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0-7864-6286-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category inline|Fox Film Corporation}}\n\n[[Category:Fox Film]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1915]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 1935]]\n[[Category:Defunct American film studios]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Film distributors of the United States]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]", "sha1": "9dvao8vefs0pb3qd0zl3b7d04zzuqe3"}}, {"title": "First National Pictures", "ns": "0", "id": "10574", "revision": {"id": "861773153", "parentid": "860908852", "timestamp": "2018-09-29T22:34:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lord Cornwallis", "id": "5957417"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Filmography */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox company\n| name = First National Pictures\n| logo = First-National-Pictures-Logo.jpg\n| logo_size =\n| logo_alt =\n| logo_caption = \n| logo_padding =\n| image = \n| image_size =\n| image_alt =\n| image_caption = \n| trading_name = \n| native_name = \n| native_name_lang =    <!-- Use ISO 639-1 code, e.g. \"fr\" for French.

It was founded in 1917 as '''First National Exhibitors' Circuit, Inc.''', an association of independent theater owners in the United States, and became the country's largest theater chain. Expanding from exhibiting movies to distributing them, the company reincorporated in 1919 as '''Associated First National Theatres, Inc.''', and '''Associated First National Pictures, Inc.''' In 1924 it expanded to become a motion picture production company as '''First National Pictures, Inc.''', and became an important studio in the film industry. In September 1928, control of First National passed to [[Warner Bros.]], into which it was completely absorbed on November 4, 1929. A number of Warner Bros. films were thereafter branded First National Pictures until 1936, when First National Pictures, Inc., was dissolved.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early history ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 140\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =Thomas-Tally-1915.jpg\n| alt1     =\n| caption1 =[[Thomas L.

It eventually controlled over 600 cinemas, more than 200 of them first-run houses (as opposed to the less lucrative second-run or neighborhood theaters to which films moved when their initial box office receipts dwindled).\n\nFirst National was the brainchild of [[Thomas L. Tally]], who was reacting to the overwhelming influence of [[Paramount Pictures]], which dominated the market. In 1912, he thought that a conglomerate of theaters throughout the nation could buy or produce and distribute its own films. In 1917 Tally and [[James Dixon Williams|J. D. Williams]] formed First National Exhibitors' Circuit.\n\nThe first film released through First National was the 1916 British film, ''[[The Mother of Dartmoor]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Between 1917 and 1918, the company made contracts with [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]], the first million-dollar deals in the history of film. Chaplin's contract allowed him to produce his films without a set release schedule. However, the production of the feature film ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' ran so long that the company started to complain. To address their concerns Chaplin invited the exhibitors to the studio, and they were so impressed by the project and charmed by the players, especially co-star [[Jackie Coogan]], that they agreed to be patient. That patience was ultimately rewarded when ''The Kid'' became a major critical and box office success.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Kevin Brownlow, David Gill |year=1983 |title=Unknown Chaplin: The Great Director |trans-title= |medium=Television production |url= |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher=Thames Television}}</ref> First National's distribution of films by independent producers is credited with launching careers including that of [[Louis B.

Highly regarded by critics, it brought him three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Picture, and made him the second director, after [[Billy Wilder]], to be honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which he directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. He next directed 1979's ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. While notorious for its lengthy and strenuous production, the film is widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]].

He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for ''[[The Bellboy and the Playgirls]]'', also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by [[Roger Corman]] and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, ''Nebo zovyot'', which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled ''[[Battle Beyond the Sun]]'', released in 1962.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on ''[[Tower of London (1962 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1962), sound man for ''[[The Young Racers]]'' (1963) and associate producer of ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" />\n\nWhile on location in Ireland for ''The Young Racers'' in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /> Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-3 |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213223755/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-3 |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}</ref> and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in 1967.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Biography\" /><ref name=\"UCLATFT\">[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/about/executive-board/francis-ford-coppola/ \"Profile: Francis Ford Coppola\"], UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television, Executive Board</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', starring [[Petula Clark]] in her first American film and veteran [[Fred Astaire]]. Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt{{According to whom|date=March 2014}} contributed to her [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]]. In his book ''The American Cinema'', [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote, \"[Coppola] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making...

However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] that [[Patton (film)#Opening|the opening scene]] would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-4 |title=An Interview with Francis Ford Coppola |publisher=achievement.org |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213223651/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/cop0int-4 |archivedate=December 13, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n{{Quotation| I wrote the script of ''Patton''.

Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|title=Godfather The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola|year=2004|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2304-6|page=32|chapter=1 Point of Departure}}</ref>\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monologue, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\n====''The Godfather'' (1972)====\n{{Main|The Godfather}}\nThe release of ''The Godfather'' in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the [[Corleone family]], received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], which he shared with Mario Puzo and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s: for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming ''The Godfather''. He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book| author = Christopher Frayling| title = Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215| year = 1981| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-7100-0503-8| page = 215 }}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]  and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time }}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation,'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[United States Presidential election, 1968|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the #1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> and is ranked at #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at #4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first in 1939 with ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' and ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: [[Herbert Ross]] in 1977 with ''[[The Goodbye Girl]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'', and [[Steven Soderbergh]] in 2000 with ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' and ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''. Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures.\n\n====''Apocalypse Now'' (1979)====\n{{Main|Apocalypse Now}}\nFollowing the success of ''The Godfather'', ''The Conversation'' and ''The Godfather Part II'', Coppola began filming ''Apocalypse Now'', an adaptation of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' set in [[Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]] (Coppola himself briefly appears as a TV news director). The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels and an unprepared [[Marlon Brando|Brando]] with a bloated appearance (which Coppola attempted to hide by shooting him in the shadows).

E. Hinton]]. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. ''The Outsiders'' is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars. These included major roles for [[Matt Dillon]], [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[C. Thomas Howell]]. Also in the cast were [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Diane Lane]] and [[Tom Cruise]]. Matt Dillon and several others also starred in Coppola's related film, ''[[Rumble Fish]]'', which was also based on a S. E. Hinton novel and filmed at the same time as ''The Outsiders'' on-location in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the musical score, including the title song \"Stay Gold\", which was based upon a famous [[Robert Frost]] poem and performed for the movie by [[Stevie Wonder]]. The film was a moderate box-office success, drawing a revenue of $25 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=outsiders.htm |title=The Outsiders|date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> against a budget of $10 million.\n\n====''Rumble Fish'' (1983)====\n{{Main|Rumble Fish}}\n''Rumble Fish'' was based on the [[Rumble Fish (novel)|novel]] of the same name by [[S.

Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionist films, ''Rumble Fish'' centres on the relationship between a revered former gang leader ([[Mickey Rourke]]) and his younger brother, Rusty James ([[Matt Dillon]]). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meagre $2.5 million against a budget of $10 million and once again aggravated Coppola's financial troubles.\n\n====''The Cotton Club'' (1984)====\n{{Main|The Cotton Club (film)}}\nIn 1984 Coppola directed the [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]]-produced ''The Cotton Club''. The film was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction.

It starred [[Robin Williams]] as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so at the age of ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With [[Diane Lane]], [[Brian Kerwin]] and [[Bill Cosby]], ''Jack'' also featured [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Fran Drescher]] and [[Michael McKean]] in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', in which [[Tom Hanks]] also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for ''Jack'', he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.\n\n====''The Rainmaker'' (1997)====\n{{Main|The Rainmaker (1997 film)}}\nThe last film Coppola directed in the 90s, ''The Rainmaker'', was based on the [[1995 in literature|1995]] [[The Rainmaker (John Grisham)|novel]] of the same name by [[John Grisham]].

Edgar Hoover]] and the children's novel ''[[The Secret Garden#Dramatic adaptations|The Secret Garden]]''. These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the ''Pinocchio'' project for Warners, as well as ''[[The Secret Garden (1993 film)|The Secret Garden]]'' (which was made in 1993 and produced by [[American Zoetrope]], but directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]]) and ''Hoover'', which never came to fruition. (A film was eventually to be made by [[Clint Eastwood]] in 2011 as ''[[J. Edgar]]'', which was distributed by Warners.)\n\nBut, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warners came to disagreement over the compensation to be paid to Coppola for his directing services on ''Pinocchio''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schleimerlaw.com/CourtAppealCoppola.htm |title=In the Court of Appeal of the State of California Second Appelate District |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref> The parties deferred this issue and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the ''Pinocchio'' film project. However, they also awarded him a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version.

However, studio executives strongly disliked all the scripts, including ''THX'' and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film.

In 1809, Finland was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]] as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].

But women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature, until 1919.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Finland declared itself independent. In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]], with the Bolshevik-leaning [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Red Guard]] supported by the equally new [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], fighting the [[Whites (Finland)|White Guard]], supported by the [[German Empire]]. After a brief attempt to [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|establish a kingdom]], the country became a republic. During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union sought repeatedly to occupy Finland, with Finland losing parts of [[Karelia]], [[Salla]], [[Kuusamo]], [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] and some islands, but retaining independence.\n\nFinland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the [[Cold War]] era. Finland joined the [[OECD]] in 1969, the [[Partnership for Peace|NATO Partnership for Peace]] in 1994,<ref name=\"nato.int\">[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49594.htm Relations with Finland].

After [[World War II]], the Soviet Union demanded war reparations from Finland not only in money but also in material, such as ships and machinery. This forced Finland to industrialise.

Two were found in the Swedish province of [[Uppland]] and have the inscription ''finlonti'' ([[Runestone U 582|U 582]]). The third was found in [[Gotland]]. It has the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Runestone G 319|G 319]]) and dates back to the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arkisto.fi/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |accessdate=22 January 2007}}</ref> The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name ''Finns'', which is mentioned at first known time AD 98 (disputed meaning).\n\n=== Suomi ===\nThe name ''Suomi'' ({{Langnf|fi|2=Finnish|3=\"Finland\"}}) has uncertain origins, but a candidate for a source is the Proto-Baltic word ''*\u017aem\u0113'', meaning \"land\". In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the [[Finnic languages]]), this name is also used in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Alternatively, the Indo-European word *''g\u02b0m-on'' \"man\" (cf. Gothic ''guma'', Latin ''homo'') has been suggested, being borrowed as *''\u0107oma''. The word originally referred only to the province of [[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]], and later to the northern coast of [[Gulf of Finland]], with northern regions such as [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] still sometimes being excluded until later. Earlier theories suggested derivation from ''suomaa'' ([[fen]] land) or ''suoniemi'' (fen cape), and parallels between ''saame'' ([[Sami people|Sami]], a Finno-Ugric people in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]), and ''[[Tavastia (historical province)|H\u00e4me]]'' (a province in the inland) were drawn, but these theories are now considered outdated.<ref>[http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/1998_613.pdf kotikielenseura.fi], SUOMI (TTAVIA ETYMOLOGIOITA).</ref>\n\nThe first survived use of word ''Suomi'' is in 811 in the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] where it is used as a person name connected to a peace treaty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/annalesregnifrancorum.html|title=Annesl Regni Francorum|website=www.thelatinlibrary.com|access-date=2018-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=''Keskiajan suomen kielen dokumentoitu sanasto ensiesiintymisvuosineen'' |last=Heikkil\u00e4 |first=Mikko K. |publisher=Mediapinta |year=2017 |isbn=978-952-236-859-1 |location= |pages=44}}</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nIn the earliest historical sources from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around [[Turku]] from [[Perni\u00f6]] to [[Uusikaupunki]]. This region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland. Finland became a common name for the whole country in a centuries-long process that started when the [[Catholic Church]] established missionary diocese in [[Nousiainen]] in the northern part of the province of Suomi possibly sometime in the 12th century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Suomen museo 2003: \"The Origins of Finland and H\u00e4me\" |last=Salo |first=Unto |publisher=Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistys |year=2004 |isbn=951-9057-55-2 |location=Helsinki |pages=55}}</ref>\n\nThe devastation of [[Finland during the Great Northern War]] (1714\u20131721) and during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743)]] caused Sweden to begin carrying out major efforts to defend its eastern half from Russia.

In 1811, Alexander I incorporated Russian [[Vyborg Governorate|Vyborg province]] into the Grand Duchy of Finland. During the Russian era, the Finnish language began to gain recognition. From the 1860s onwards, a strong Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]] known as the [[Fennoman movement]] grew.

For example, the universal suffrage was, in practice, virtually meaningless, since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament.

Since the head of state was the [[tsar]] of Russia, it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution. The Parliament, controlled by social democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the highest authority to the Parliament.

Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament (and thus the ensuing elections) were extralegal. The two nearly equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the social democratic party, were highly antagonized.\n\nThe [[October Revolution]] in Russia changed the geopolitical situation anew. Suddenly, the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as the [[Bolsheviks]] took power in Russia.

As a result of the two wars, Finland ceded most of [[Finnish Karelia]], [[Salla]], and [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], which amounted to 10% of its land area and 20% of its industrial capacity, including the ports of [[Vyborg]] (Viipuri) and the ice-free [[Liinakhamari]] (Liinahamari).

The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president [[Urho Kekkonen]] against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name \"[[Finlandization]]\" by the West German press.\n\nDespite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from [[Bilateral trade|trade privileges]] with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and 80s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. Finland negotiated with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.\n\nFinland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but swiftly began increasing integration with the West.

[[Gleysol]]s and peat [[bog]]s occupy poorly drained areas.\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Finland|Wildlife of Finland}}\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]], [[Sarmatic mixed forests]], and [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]]. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-[[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the [[tree line]] and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.\n\n[[File:\u00c4ht\u00e4rin karhut 7.jpg|thumb|The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is Finland's national animal.]]\nSimilarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native [[mammal]]ian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago.\nLarge and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the [[brown bear]] (the national animal), [[gray wolf]], [[wolverine]], and [[Moose|elk]]. Three of the more striking birds are the [[whooper swan]], a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the [[Western capercaillie]], a large, black-plumaged member of the [[grouse]] family; and the [[Eurasian eagle-owl]]. The latter is considered an indicator of [[old-growth forest]] connectivity, and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514259904/html/x288.html |title=Nutritional and genetic adaptation of galliform birds: implications for hand-rearing and restocking |work=Oulu University Library (2000) |accessdate=23 May 2008}}</ref> The most common breeding birds are the [[willow warbler]], [[common chaffinch]], and [[redwing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.fi/lintuharrastus/faq-muut.shtml#pesimalinnut |title=BirdLife Finland |work=BirdLife International (2004) Birds in Europe: population estimates, trends and conservation status.

In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the whole of Finland lies in the [[subarctic climate|boreal zone]], characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the [[temperateness]] varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] and a [[continental climate]]. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the [[Baltic Sea]] and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same [[latitude]], such as [[Alaska]], [[Siberia]], and southern [[Greenland]].<ref name=\"Finland's climate\">{{cite web |title=Finland's climate |url=http://www.fmi.fi/weather/climate.html |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWinters in southern Finland (when mean daily temperature remains below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|disp=or}}) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as [[Helsinki]], snow often covers the land from late December to late March.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://ilmasto-opas.fi/fi/ilmastonmuutos/suomen-muuttuva-ilmasto/-/artikkeli/08848977-fd1a-4e85-8389-7ecf3ca7de7d/uusimaa-merellisen-ilmaston-maakunta.html|title = The climate in Finland (finnish)|date = |accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to {{convert|-30|\u00b0C}} although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below {{convert|-30|\u00b0C|0}} are rare.

The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of a region. The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions. Currently, the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu. Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population.\n\nIn addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.\n\nRegions represent dialectal, cultural, and economic variations better than the former [[Provinces of Finland|provinces]], which were purely administrative divisions of the central government. Historically, regions are divisions of [[historical provinces of Finland]], areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately.\n\nSix [[Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland|Regional State Administrative Agencies]] were created by the state of Finland in 2010, each of them responsible for one of the regions called {{lang|fi|alue}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|region}} in Swedish; in addition, \u00c5land was designated a seventh region. These take over some of the tasks of the earlier [[Provinces of Finland]] (''l\u00e4\u00e4ni''/''l\u00e4n''), which were abolished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |title=Tervetuloa aluehallintoviraston verkkosivuille! |publisher=State Provincial Office |language=Finnish |accessdate=9 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315151138/http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>\n{| style=\"with:90%\"\n| style=\"width:50%\" |{{Finnish Regions|options=float:top}}\n| style=\"width:50%\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue. {{As of|2017}}, there are 311 municipalities,<ref name=\"Suomen Kuntaliitto\" /> and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.\n\nIn addition to municipalities, two intermediate levels are defined. Municipalities co-operate in seventy [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of \u00c5land has a permanent democratically elected regional council. Sami people have a semi-autonomous [[Sami native region (Finland)|Sami native region]] in Lapland for issues on language and culture.\n\nIn the following chart, the number of inhabitants includes those living in the entire municipality (''kunta/kommun''), not just in the built-up area. The land area is given in km\u00b2, and the density in inhabitants per km\u00b2 (land area). The figures are as of {{#time:d F Y |{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}}}}.

Market]]]]\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe [[Constitution of Finland]] defines the political system; Finland is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the framework of a [[representative democracy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] is the country's most powerful person. The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000, and was amended on 1 March 2012. Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential and [[Elections in the European Union|European Union elections]].\n\n=== President ===\n{{Main|President of Finland}}\nThe [[head of state]] of Finland is [[President of Finland|President of the Republic of Finland]] (in Finnish: ''Suomen tasavallan presidentti''; in Swedish: ''Republiken Finlands president''). Finland has had for most of its independence a [[semi-presidential system]], but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished. In constitution amendments, which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000, amended in 2012, the President's position has become primarily a ceremonial office. However, the President still leads the nation's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces.<ref name=\"Parliamentary\">Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his \"Scandinavian Politics Today\" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal |last = Nousiainen |first = Jaakko |title = From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland |journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |volume = 24 |issue = 2 |pages = 95\u2013109 |publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] |doi = 10.1111/1467-9477.00048 |date = June 2001 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9477.00048 |ref = harv }} as follows: \"There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'.\" Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: \"The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)\". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref> The position still does entail some powers, including responsibility for [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] (excluding affairs related to the [[European Union]]) in cooperation with the [[Finnish Government|cabinet]], being [[Commander-in-Chief|the head of the armed forces]], some decree and pardoning powers, and some appointive powers. Direct, one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The current president is [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]; he took office on 1 March 2012. Former presidents were [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg|K. J.

The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].\n\n=== Parliament ===\n{{Main|Parliament of Finland}}\n[[File:Eduskuntatalo Helsinki.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Finland]]'s main building.]]\n\nThe 200-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] ({{Lang-fi|Eduskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Riksdag}}) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's [[Parliament of Finland#Committees|constitutional law committee]]. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional [[D'Hondt method]] within a number of multi-seat constituencies through open list multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation. The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of the parliament]] is [[Paula Risikko]] ([[National Coalition]]).<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.eduskunta.fi/EN/tiedotteet/Pages/speaker-risikko-elected.aspx| title = Paula Risikko Elected as New Speaker of Parliament |publisher = [[Parliament of Finland|Eduskunta]]| author =| accessdate = 24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (former Agrarian Union), the [[National Coalition Party]], and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support, and their combined vote has totalled about 65\u201380% of all votes. Their lowest common total of MPs, 121, was reached in the 2011 elections. For a few decades after 1944, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong fourth party. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the [[Liberals (Finland)|Liberals]] and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the [[Green League]] since 1983. In the 2011 elections, the [[True Finns|Finns Party]] achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<ref>The source for historical information on party support is [[:fi:Suomen eduskunta#Kansanedustajat puolueittain ja vaaleittain|the Finnish Wikipedia's article on the parliament]]</ref>\n\nThe autonomous province of \u00c5land, which forms a [[federacy]] with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the [[parliamentary group]] of the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]]. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent [[Parliament of \u00c5land|regional council]], and in the [[\u00c5land legislative election, 2011|2011 elections]], [[\u00c5land Centre]] was the largest party.)\n\nThe Parliament can be dissolved by a recommendation of the Prime Minister, endorsed by the President. This procedure has never been used, although the parliament was dissolved eight times under the pre-2000 constitution, when this action was the sole prerogative of the president.\n\nAfter the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015|parliamentary elections on 19 April 2015]], the seats were divided among eight parties as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2015/eduskuntavaalit/?puolueet_##taulukko| title = Eduskuntavaalit 2015 \u2013 tulospalvelu \u2013 yle.fi| publisher = [[Yle]]| author =| accessdate = 5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens (the last time in 1957), as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.<ref>[[:fi:Ep\u00e4luottamuslause|The Finnish Wikipedia's article on Motion of no confidence]]</ref>\n\nThe cabinet exercises most executive powers, and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], and consists of him or her, of other ministers, and of the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]]. The current prime minister is [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]] (Centre Party). Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|minister of finance]]. The incumbent Minister of Finance is [[Petteri Orpo]].\n\nAs no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Law of Finland|Judicial system of Finland}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Finland.jpg|thumb|right|The Court House of the Supreme Court]]\nThe judicial system of Finland is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on [[Judiciary of Sweden|Swedish law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus'', ''tingsr\u00e4tt''), regional appellate courts (''hovioikeus'', ''hovr\u00e4tt''), and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (''korkein oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta domstolen''). The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts (''hallinto-oikeus'', ''f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstol'') and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''korkein hallinto-oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen''). In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration.

Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Tracked transport vehicle Sisu NA 110.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sisu Nasu]] NA-110 tracked transport vehicle of the Finnish Army.

The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Women's voluntary service] (in Finnish)</ref> Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.\nThe army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier.\n\nFinnish defence expenditure per capita is one of the highest in the European Union.<ref>[http://www.stat.fi/artikkelit/2007/art_2007-06-01_005.html Ty\u00f6voimakustannukset puuttuvat puolustusmenoista], Statistics Finland (in Finnish): Eurostat ranking is sixth, but the third when conscription is accounted.</ref> The Finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence.

The country lies between the latitudes 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nForests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nPrivate sector employees amount to 1.8 million, out of which around a third with tertiary education.

Initially, most development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the \"metal industry\" (''metalliteollisuus'') and \"forest industry\" (''mets\u00e4teollisuus''). The \"metal industry\" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the car industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals (steel, copper and chromium). The world's biggest [[cruise ship]]s are built in Finnish shipyards. The \"forest industry\" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources (77% of the area is covered by forest, most of it in renewable use). In the [[pulp and paper industry]], many of the largest companies are based in Finland ([[Ahlstrom]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]], and [[UPM (company)|UPM]]). However, the Finnish economy has diversified, with expansion into fields such as electronics (e.g. [[Nokia]]), metrology ([[Vaisala]]), transport fuels ([[Neste]]), chemicals ([[Kemira]]), engineering consulting ([[P\u00f6yry]]), and information technology (e.g. [[Rovio Entertainment]], known for [[Angry Birds]]), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing reducing in importance; agriculture is only a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\nIn an [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] report released in September 2011, Finland clinched the second place after the United States on Benchmarking IT Industry Competitiveness 2011 which scored on 6 key indicators: overall business environment, technology infrastructure, human capital, legal framework, public support for industry development, and research and development landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |title=Singapore Tops IT Competitiveness in Asia Pacific, Ranks No. 3 Worldwide |date=27 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204542/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |archivedate=20 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Public policy ===\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\n\nFinnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model.<ref name=\"nordicmodel\">[http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf The Nordic Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905212132/http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf |date=5 September 2012 }} by Torben M.

Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making, with educational and financial assistance provided by the state. [[Folk high school]]s are a distinctly Nordic institution.

This prompted [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the Finnish [[national epic]]. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably [[Aleksis Kivi]] and [[Eino Leino]]. Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] and [[Zachris Topelius]].\n\nAfter Finland became independent, there was a rise of [[Modernist literature|modernist writers]], most famously the Finnish-speaking [[Mika Waltari]] and Swedish-speaking [[Edith S\u00f6dergran]]. [[Frans Eemil Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1939. World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]]. Besides Kalevala and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking [[Tove Jansson]] is the most translated Finnish writer. <!--Pure opinion?: Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state.--> Popular modern writers include [[Arto Paasilinna]], [[Ilkka Remes]], [[Kari Hotakainen]], [[Sofi Oksanen]], and [[Jari Tervo]], while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious [[Finlandia Prize]].\n[[File:Sammon puolustus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], ''[[The Defense of the Sampo]]'', 1896, [[Turku Art Museum]].]]\n\n=== Visual arts, design, and architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Finland|Art in Finland}}\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century, when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known of Finnish painters, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], started painting in a naturalist style, but moved to national romanticism. Finland's best-known sculptor of the twentieth century was [[W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen]], remembered for his monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] and sculptures. Finns have made major contributions to [[handicraft]]s and [[industrial design]]: among the internationally renowned figures are [[Timo Sarpaneva]], [[Tapio Wirkkala]] and [[Ilmari Tapiovaara]]. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as [[Jugendstil]] (or [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Nordic Classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. Among the top twentieth-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are [[Eliel Saarinen]] and his son [[Eero Saarinen]]. Architect [[Alvar Aalto]] is regarded as among the most important twentieth-century designers in the world;<ref>James Stevens Curl, ''Dictionary of Architecture'', Grange Books, Rochester, 2005, p. 1.</ref> he helped bring [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist architecture]] to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.<ref>Sigfried Giedion, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2nd edition, 1949.</ref> Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles and [[glassware]], which were usually incorporated into his buildings.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Jean Sibelius, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957), a significant figure in the history of [[European classical music|classical music]].]]\n{{Main|Music of Finland|Rock music in Finland|Sami music}}\n\n;Classical\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the ''[[Kalevala]]''. Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, less influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence than the [[Nordic folk dance music]] that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish [[folk music]] has undergone a [[roots revival]] in recent decades, and has become a part of [[popular music]].\n\nThe people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the [[Sami people|Sami]], are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called [[joik]]. The same word sometimes refers to [[lavlu]] or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.\n\nThe first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem [[Maamme|''Maamme/V\u00e5rt land'' (Our Country)]], Finland's [[national anthem]]. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]''. He soon received a grant to study ''runo singers'' in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed ''[[Finlandia]]'', which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.\n\nToday, Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland's important [[List of Finnish composers|composers]] are still alive, such as [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Kalevi Aho]], and [[Aulis Sallinen]]. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Leif Segerstam]]. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are [[Karita Mattila]], [[Soile Isokoski]], [[Pekka Kuusisto]], [[Olli Mustonen]], and [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]].\n\n;Modern\n[[File:Apocalyptica1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Perttu Kivilaakso]] of [[Apocalyptica]].]]\n''Iskelm\u00e4'' (coined directly from the German word ''[[Schlager]]'', meaning \"hit\") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of [[dance music]]; [[Tango music|tango]], a style of [[Music of Argentina|Argentine music]], is also popular. The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands, [[jazz]] musicians, [[hip hop]] performers, dance music acts, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged, playing [[instrumental rock]] inspired by groups such as [[The Shadows]]. Around 1964, [[Beatlemania]] arrived in Finland, resulting in further development of the local rock scene. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] and [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Hurriganes]]. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]] in the 1980s. [[Hanoi Rocks]] was a pioneering 1980s [[glam rock]] act that inspired the American [[hard rock]] group [[Guns N' Roses]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333813382925678|title=Guns N' Roses Can Agree on at Least One Thing: This Finnish Saxophonist Rocks |last=Shah|first=Neil|date=15 April 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition.

At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], great pride was taken in the three gold medals won by the original \"[[Flying Finn]]\" [[Hannes Kolehmainen]].\n\nFinland was one of the most successful countries at the Olympic Games before [[World War II]]. At the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], Finland, a nation then of only 3.2 million people, came second in the medal count. In the 1920s and 1930s, Finnish long-distance runners dominated the Olympics, with [[Paavo Nurmi]] winning a total of nine Olympic gold medals between 1920 and 1928 and setting 22 official world records between 1921 and 1931. Nurmi is often considered the greatest Finnish sportsman and one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nFor over 100 years, Finnish male and female athletes have consistently excelled at the [[javelin throw]]. The event has brought Finland nine Olympic gold medals, five world championships, five European championships, and 24 world records.\n\nIn addition to Kolehmainen and Nurmi, some of Finland's most internationally well-known and successful sportspeople are long-distance runners [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]]; ski-jumpers [[Matti Nyk\u00e4nen]] and [[Janne Ahonen]]; cross-country skiers [[Veikko Hakulinen]], [[Eero M\u00e4ntyranta]], [[Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi]] and [[Mika Myllyl\u00e4]]; rower [[Pertti Karppinen]]; gymnast [[Heikki Savolainen (gymnast)|Heikki Savolainen]]; professional skateboarder [[Arto Saari]]; ice hockey players [[Kimmo Timonen]], [[Jari Kurri]], [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne]], and [[Saku Koivu]]; football players [[Jari Litmanen]] and [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]]; basketball player [[Hanno M\u00f6tt\u00f6l\u00e4]]; alpine skiers [[Kalle Palander]] and [[Tanja Poutiainen]]; Formula One world champions [[Keke Rosberg]], [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]; four-time World Rally champions [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]]; and 13-time World [[Enduro]] Champion [[Juha Salminen]], seven-time champion [[Kari Tiainen]], and the five-time champions [[Mika Ahola]], biathlete [[Kaisa M\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen]] and [[Samuli Aro]]. Finland is also one of the most successful nations in [[bandy]], being the only nation beside Russia and Sweden to win a [[Bandy World Championship]].\n\nThe [[1952 Summer Olympics]] were held in Helsinki. Other notable sporting events held in Finland include the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|1983]] and [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]].\n\nFinland also has a notable history in [[figure skating]]. Finnish skaters have won 8 world championships and 13 junior world cups in synchronized skating, and Finland is considered one of the best countries at the sport.\n\nSome of the most popular recreational sports and activities include [[floorball]], [[Nordic walking]], running, cycling, and skiing ([[alpine skiing]], [[cross-country skiing]], and [[ski jumping]]).\nFloorball, in terms of registered players, occupies third place after football and ice hockey. According to the Finnish Floorball Federation, floorball is the most popular school, youth, club and workplace sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expat-finland.com/events/finnish_sports.html|title=Finnish Sports: Try the sports Finns love!|first=Stuart Allt Web Design, Turku,|last=Finland|website=www.expat-finland.com}}</ref> {{as of|2016}}, the total number of licensed players reaches 57,400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floorball.org/pages/EN/Finland|title=IFF|first=|last=IFF|website=www.floorball.org}}</ref>\n\nEspecially since the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]], [[Finland national basketball team|Finland's national basketball team]] has received widespread public attention.

The word ''flagellate'' also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \"flagellate\" is included in other terms (such as \"[[dinoflagellate]]\" and \"[[choanoflagellata]]\") which are more formally characterized.<ref name=\"pmid8868448\">{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T. |title=Zooflagellate phylogeny and classification |journal=Tsitologiya |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=1010\u201329 |year=1995 |pmid=8868448 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\n== Form and behavior ==\nEukaryotic flagella are supported by [[microtubule]]s in a characteristic arrangement, with nine fused pairs surrounding two central singlets. These arise from a [[basal body]]. In some flagellates, flagella direct food into a [[cytostome]] or mouth, where food is [[Ingestion|ingested]].  Flagella often support hairs, called [[mastigonemes]], or contain rods. Their ultrastructure plays an important role in classifying [[eukaryote]]s. \n\nAmong [[protoctist]]s and microscopic animals, a flagellate is an organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. Some cells in animals may be flagellate, for instance the spermatozoa of most phyla. Flowering plants do not produce flagellate cells, but ferns, mosses, green algae, and some gymnosperms and closely related plants do so. Likewise, most fungi do not produce cells with flagellae, but the primitive fungal chytrids do. Many protists take the form of single-celled flagellates.\n\nFlagella are generally used for [[propulsion]]. They may also be used to create a current that brings in food.  In most such organisms, one or more flagella are located at or near the anterior of the cell, e.g., ''[[Euglena]]''.  Often there is one directed forwards and one trailing behind. Among animals, fungi, which are part of a group called the [[opisthokont]]s, there is a single posterior flagellum. They are from the phylum Mastigophora. They can cause diseases and are typically heterotrophic. They reproduce by binary fission.They spend most of their existence moving or feeding. Many parasites that affect human health or economy are flagellates. Flagellates are the major consumers of primary and secondary production in aquatic [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] - consuming bacteria and other protists.[[Image:Flagellata 1.png|thumb|\"Flagellata\" from [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]]]\n== Flagellates as specialized cells or life cycle stages ==\n\nAn overview of the occurrence of flagellated cells in eukaryote groups, as specialized cells of multicellular organisms or as life cycle stages, is given below (see also the article [[flagellum]]):<ref>Raven, J.A. 2000.

They were sometimes grouped with [[Sarcodina]] (ameboids) in the group [[Sarcomastigophora]].\n\nThe autotrophic flagellates were grouped similarly to the botanical schemes used for the corresponding algae groups.

The \"[[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal senses]]\", which detect chemical [[irritation|irritants]] in the [[mouth]] and [[throat]], as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with [[nature|natural]] or artificial flavorants which affect these senses.\n\nA \"flavorant\" is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glosbe.com/en/en/flavorant|title=flavorant - definition - English|website=Glosbe|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>  A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of FLAVOR|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flavor|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOf the three chemical senses, smell is the main determinant of a food item's flavor. Five [[basic tastes]] \u2013 [[sweet]], [[sour]], [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], [[saltiness|salty]] and [[umami]] (savory) are universally recognized, although some cultures also include [[pungency]]<ref name=\"Bueker\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2hsBJAp5fYC&lpg=PP1&dq=Ayurvedic%20balancing%3A%20an%20integration%20of%20Western%20fitness%20with%20Eastern%20wellness&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=the%20six%20tastes&f=false Ayurvedic balancing: an integration of Western fitness with Eastern wellness (Pages 25-26/188)] Joyce Bueker.

The number of food smells is unbounded; a food's flavor, therefore, can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar. This is exemplified in artificially flavored [[gelatin dessert|jellies]], [[soft drink]]s and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances. The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by [[flavorist]]s.\n\nAlthough the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell. Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorants are \"nature-identical\", which means that they are the [[chemical compound|chemical]] equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials. Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as [[headspace technology|headspace techniques]], so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present.\n\n==Flavorants or flavorings==\nFlavorings are focused on altering the flavors of natural food product such as meats and vegetables, or creating flavor for food products that do not have the desired flavors such as [[candy|candies]] and other [[snacks]]. Most types of flavorings are focused on scent and taste. Few commercial products exist to stimulate the [[trigeminal]] senses, since these are sharp, astringent, and typically unpleasant flavors.\n\nThree principal types of flavorings are used in foods, under definitions agreed in the [[European Union|EU]] and [[Australia]]:<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/flavourings_user_guide_0802.pdf From Australian Food Standards Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091222/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/flavourings_user_guide_0802.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Type\n!Description\n|-\n|Natural flavoring substances\n|These flavoring substances are obtained from plant or animal raw materials, by physical, microbiological, or enzymatic processes.

Although they are chemically different, in sensory characteristics they are the same as natural ones.\n|}\n\nMost artificial flavors are specific and often complex mixtures of singular naturally occurring flavor compounds combined together to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor. These mixtures are formulated by flavorists to give a food product a unique flavor and to maintain flavor consistency between different product batches or after recipe changes. The list of known flavoring agents includes thousands of molecular compounds, and the flavor chemist (flavorist) can often mix these together to produce many of the common flavors. Many flavorants consist of [[ester]]s, which are often described as being \"sweet\" or \"fruity\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question391.htm|title=How do artificial flavors work?|publisher=howstuffworks|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin-left:10%;\"\n|-\n!Chemical\n!Odor\n|-\n|[[Diacetyl]], [[acetylpropionyl]], [[acetoin]]\n|[[Butter]]y\n|-\n|[[Isoamyl acetate]]\n|[[Banana]]\n|-\n|[[Benzaldehyde]]\n|[[Bitter almond]], [[cherry]]\n|-\n|[[Cinnamaldehyde]]\n|[[Cinnamon]]\n|-\n|[[Ethyl propionate]]\n|[[Fruit]]y\n|-\n|[[Methyl anthranilate]]\n|[[Grape]]\n|-\n|[[Limonene]]\n|[[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]\n|-\n|[[Ethyl decadienoate]]\n|[[Pear]]\n|-\n|[[Allyl hexanoate]]\n|[[Pineapple]]\n|-\n|[[Ethyl maltol]]\n|[[Sugar]], [[cotton candy]]\n|-\n|[[Ethylvanillin]]\n|[[Vanilla]]\n|-\n|[[Methyl salicylate]]\n|[[Wintergreen]]\n|-\n|[[Manzanate]]\n|[[Apple]]\n|}\n\nThe compounds used to produce artificial flavors are almost identical to those that occur naturally.

In the brief, the clients  attempt to communicate exactly what type of flavor they seek, in what application it will be used, and any special requirements (e.g., must be all natural). The communication barrier can be quite difficult to overcome since most people are not experienced at describing flavors. The flavorist uses his or her knowledge of the available chemical ingredients to create a formula and compound it on an electronic balance. The flavor is then submitted to the client for testing. Several iterations, with feedback from the client, may be needed before the right flavor is found.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAdditional work may also be done by the flavor company.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For example, the flavor company may conduct sensory taste tests to test consumer acceptance of a flavor before it is sent to the client or to further investigate the \"sensory space\". The flavor company may also employ application specialists who work to ensure the flavor will work in the application for which it is intended. This may require special flavor delivery technologies that are used to protect the flavor during processing or [[cooking]] so that the flavor is only released when eaten by the end consumer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Determination==\nFew standards are available or being prepared for sensory analysis of flavors.<ref>e.g. ISO 13301:2002 Sensory analysis -- Methodology -- General guidance for measuring odor, flavor and taste detection thresholds by a three-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) procedure, or ISO 6564:1985 Sensory analysis -- Methodology -- Flavor profile methods.</ref> In [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] of flavors, [[solid phase extraction]], [[solid phase microextraction]], and headspace [[gas chromatography]] are applied to extract and separate the flavor compounds in the sample.

people]], who live on the southern fringes of the [[North Sea]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. The Frisian languages are the closest living language group to the [[Anglic languages]]; the two groups make up the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]] group. However, modern English and Frisian are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to independent linguistic innovations and foreign influences.\n\nThere are three different Frisian languages: [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], by far the most spoken of the three, is an official language in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Friesland]], where it is spoken on the mainland and on two of the [[West Frisian Islands]]: [[Terschelling]] and [[Schiermonnikoog]]. Furthermore, it is spoken in four villages in the [[Westerkwartier]] of the neighbouring province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] is spoken in the northernmost [[Germany|German]] [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]: On the [[North Frisia]]n mainland, and on the [[North Frisian Islands]] of [[Sylt]], [[F\u00f6hr]], [[Amrum]], and the [[Halligen]]. It is also spoken on the islands of [[Heligoland]] and [[D\u00fcne]], in the [[North Sea]]. The third Frisian language, [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]], a variant of East Frisan, is only spoken in four villages in the [[Cloppenburg (district)|district of Cloppenburg]] in the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The four villages of the [[Saterland|Saterland/Seelterlound]] lie just outside the borders of [[East Frisia]], where, apart from [[German language|German]], [[East Frisian Low Saxon]], which is not a Frisian language, but a variant of [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], is spoken.\n\nDepending upon their location, the three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]]. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the [[Great Yarmouth]] area and [[Friesland]] are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long [[Hanseatic League]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]].<ref>{{Cite book |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237534065_The_Position_of_Frisian_in_the_Germanic_Language_Area |chapter = The Position of Frisian in the Germanic Language Area|last = Gooskens|first = Charlotte|date = 2004| title = On the Boundaries of Phonology and Phonetics |editor-first = D.

Some linguists consider these three varieties, despite their [[mutual unintelligibility]], to be dialects of one single Frisian language, whereas others consider them to be three separate languages, as do their speakers. West Frisian is strongly influenced by Dutch, and, like Dutch, is described as being \"between\" English and German. The other Frisian languages, meanwhile, have been influenced by Low German and German. The North Frisian language especially is further segmented into several strongly diverse dialects. [[Stadsfries]] and [[West Frisian Dutch]] are not Frisian, but [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialects influenced by West Frisian. Frisian is called ''Frysk'' in West Frisian, ''Fr\u00e4isk'' in Saterland Frisian, and ''Frasch'', ''Fresk'', ''Freesk'', and ''Friisk'' in the dialects of North Frisian.\n\nThe situation in the Dutch province of Groningen and the German region of [[East Frisia]] is more complex: The local [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Gronings]] and [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] are a mixture of Frisian and Low Saxon dialects; it is believed that Frisian was spoken there at one time, only to have been gradually replaced by Low Saxon. This local language is now, in turn, being replaced by standard Dutch and German.\n\n===Speakers===\nMost Frisian speakers live in the [[Netherlands]], primarily in the province of [[Friesland]], since 1997 officially using its West Frisian name of Frysl\u00e2n, where the number of native speakers is about 400,000,<ref name=\"Extra\">{{Cite book|title = The Other Languages of Europe: Demographic, Sociolinguistic, and Educational Perspectives|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hvmy_skUPNYC|publisher = Multilingual Matters|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9781853595097|first = Guus|last = Extra|first2 = Durk|last2 = Gorter}}</ref> which is about 75% of the inhabitants of Friesland.<ref name=Bremmer>{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Old Frisian: History, Grammar, Reader, Glossary|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uWYsSOp6g58C|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9027232555|language = en|first = Rolf Hendrik|last = Bremmer}}</ref> An increasing number of native Dutch speakers in the province are learning Frisian as a second language.\n\nIn [[Germany]], there are about 2,000<ref>\"Gegenw\u00e4rtige Sch\u00e4tzungen schwanken zwischen 1.500 und 2.500.\" Marron C.

At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern [[North Sea]] coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as Great Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian languages have been lost.\n\nFrisian is the language most closely related to [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]], but after at least five hundred years of being subject to the influence of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], modern Frisian in some aspects bears a greater similarity to Dutch than to English; one must also take into account the centuries-long drift of English away from Frisian. Thus the two languages have become less mutually intelligible over time, partly due to the marks which Dutch and [[Low German]] have left on Frisian, and partly due to the vast influence some languages (in particular [[Norman French]]) have had on English throughout the centuries.\n\n[[Old Frisian]],<ref name=Bremmer /> however, was very similar to [[Old English language|Old English]]. Historically, both English and Frisian are marked by the loss of the Germanic nasal in words like ''us'' (''\u00fas''; ''uns'' in German), ''soft'' (''s\u00eaft''; ''sanft'') or ''goose'' (''goes''; ''Gans''): see [[Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law]]. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic ''k'' softened to a ''ch'' sound; for example, the Frisian for ''cheese'' and ''church'' is ''tsiis'' and ''tsjerke'', whereas in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is ''kaas'' and ''kerk'', and in High German the respective words are ''K\u00e4se'' and ''Kirche''. Contrarily, this did not happen for ''chin'' and ''choose'', which are ''kin'' and ''kieze''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last1=Gooskens |first1=Charlotte |last2=Heeringa |first2= Wilbert |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charlotte_Gooskens/publication/237534065_The_Position_of_Frisian_in_the_Germanic_Language_Area/links/00463528e89b97127d000000.pdf |title=The Position of Frisian in the Germanic Language Area |date=May 2012 |journal=Researchgate |accessdate=25 August 2017 |publisher = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dicts.info/dictionary.php?k1=1&k2=178 |title=English to Frisian dictionary}}</ref>\n\nOne rhyme demonstrates the palpable similarity between Frisian and English: \"Butter, bread and green cheese is good English and good Frisian,\" which is pronounced more or less the same in both languages (West Frisian: \"B\u00fbter, brea en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.\") <ref>The History of English: A Linguistic Introduction. Scott Shay, Wardja Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-615-16817-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-615-16817-3}}</ref>\n\nOne major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period (c.1150-c.1550) [[Declension|grammatical cases]] still existed. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legalistic writings. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of [[runic]] inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute [[literature]] as such. The transition from the Old Frisian to the Middle Frisian period (c.1550-c.1820) in the 16th century is based on the fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.\n\n===Middle West Frisian===\n{{Main|Middle Frisian}}\nUp until the 15th century Frisian was a language widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of [[Friesland]] (Frysl\u00e2n), in 1498, by Duke Albert of Saxony, who replaced West Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.\n\nAfterwards this practice was continued under the [[Habsburg]] rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his son, the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, West Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of [[County of Holland|Holland]] as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.\n\nIn this period the great Frisian poet [[Gysbert Japiks]] (1603\u201366), a schoolteacher and [[Cantus|cantor]] from the city of [[Bolsward]], who largely fathered modern West Frisian literature and orthography, was really an exception to the rule.\n\nHis example was not followed until the 19th century, when entire generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer [[Vowel breaking|breaking]] system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of Southwest Frisian. Therefore, the Modern West Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.\n\n=== Modern West Frisian ===\nThe revival of the West Frisian Language comes from the poet [[Gysbert Japiks]], who had begun to write in the language as a way to show that it was possible, and created a collective West Frisian identity and West Frisian standard of writing through his poetry.<ref name=\":0\"/> Later on, [[Johannes Hilarides]] would build off Gysbert Japik's work by building on West Frisian orthography, particularly on its pronunciation; he also, unlike Japiks, set a standard of the West Frisian language that focused more heavily on how the common people used it as an everyday language.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nPerhaps the most important figure in the spreading of the West Frisian language was [[J.

By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.\n\nNear the beginning of the 19th century, the [[French government]] began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minority and regional languages ([[Patois]]) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with [[Henri Gr\u00e9goire]]'s \"''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language\"''. When public education was made [[Compulsory education|compulsory]], only French was taught and the use of any other (Patois) language was punished.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* Nasals: The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* Fricatives: French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. Notice that {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* final consonants: Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* [[elision (French)|elision]] or vowel dropping: Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed for \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one to one correlation from a phoneme to its related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber, tombai,'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' all end with the /E/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|url=http://www-tandfonline-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/wsr/wsr003|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** The [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''le tr\u00e9ma'') (e.g., ''na'''\u00ef'''f''\u2014naive, ''No'''\u00eb'''l''\u2014Christmas) as in English, specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one, not combined, and is not a [[schwa]].\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* only two [[grammatical gender]]s\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* new [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] formed from auxiliaries\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante.\" However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants.\" A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants.\" In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant,\" both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le,\" \"la,\" and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[Infinitive|infinitive mood]] (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight different tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Mark a conduit la voiture.\" ''Mark drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Mark.\" ''The car was driven by Mark.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[Verb\u2013object\u2013subject|verb\u2013object\u2013subject (VOS)]] and [[Object\u2013subject\u2013verb|object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV)]] word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the different counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences). This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge, England | page = 110 | isbn = 0-521-09838-6}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

[[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.\n\nFormula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.\n\nGenres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.\n\nThe ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.\n\n''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[clich\u00e9]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.\n\nFormula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as \"[[The Cold Equations]]\", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.\n\nThe dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Film genre]]\n*[[Literary fiction]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ipl.org/div/farq/plotFARQ.html The \"Basic\" Plots in Literature]\n* [http://www.tvtropes.org TV Tropes Wiki], a \"trope-tracking\" website\n\n{{Appropriation in the Arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Formula Fiction}}\n[[Category:Fiction]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)]]\n[[Category:Literary genres]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n\n[[de:Trivialliteratur]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430]]\n[[sl:Trivialna literatura]]\n[[zh:\u516c\u5f0f\u5c0f\u8aaa]]", "sha1": "1nm6163552vsgv7j3thjhx9gpjkdi2f"}}, {"title": "Field (mathematics)", "ns": "0", "id": "10603", "revision": {"id": "862817386", "parentid": "861613551", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T21:49:37Z", "contributor": {"ip": "68.65.174.192"}, "comment": "/* Topological fields */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|fields in algebra|fields in geometry|Vector field|other uses|Field (disambiguation)#Mathematics{{!}}Field \u00a7 Mathematics}}\n{{good article}}\n\n[[File:Regular_polygon_7_annotated.svg|thumb|262px|The [[regular polygon|regular]] [[heptagon]] cannot be constructed using [[compass and straightedge]]. This can be proven using the field of [[constructible number]]s.]]\n{{Algebraic structures}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''field'''  is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] on which [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are defined, and behave as the corresponding operations on  [[rational number|rational]] and [[real number]]s do. \nA field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]], which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]] and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] can not be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|''&minus;a''}} for all elements ''a'', and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] ''b''<sup>\u22121</sup> for every nonzero element ''b''. This allows us to consider also the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]] {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, via defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation|operations]] called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to ''every'' pair of its elements. The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''sum'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''product'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a''\u22c5''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''field axioms''. In the following definitions,  {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{math|''F''}}.\n\n* ''[[Associativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}  and  {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* ''[[Commutativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* ''[[Additive identity|Additive]]'' and ''[[multiplicative identity]]'': there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* ''[[Additive inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* ''[[Multiplicative inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, {{math|1/''a''}},  or {{math|{{sfrac|1|''a''}}}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* ''[[Distributivity]]'' of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''; it is an [[abelian group]] under the addition, with 0 as [[additive identity]]; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under the multiplication, with 1 as [[multiplicative identity]]; the multiplication is distributive over the addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through ''B'' in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{nowrap|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''<sup>''p''</sup> := ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}. All field homomorphisms are [[injective]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=section I.3}}</ref> If {{math|''f''}} is also [[surjective]], it is called an isomorphism (or the fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called isomorphic).\n\nA field is called a [[prime field]] if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}</ref>\n\n==Finite fields==\n{{main|Finite field}}\n''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements. Its subfield {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 \u2260 0.\n\n[[File:Clock_group.svg|thumb|In modular arithmetic modulo&nbsp;12, 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 since 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;13 in {{math|'''Z'''}}, which divided by 12 leaves remainder&nbsp;1. Since 12 is not a prime, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field, though.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field ''E'') is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1={{nowrap begin}}''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''p''(''X'')).{{nowrap end}}}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol i, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(i) = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to ''E''. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{Overline|''F''}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{Overline|''F''}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;&ge;. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field ''F'' is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] W(''F'') of [[quadratic form]]s over ''F'', to '''Z'''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{nowrap|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set ''F'' is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|<nowiki>|</nowiki>''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''p''/''q''<nowiki>|</nowiki>}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence\n|-\n| {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}}} || {{math|1=<nowiki>|</nowiki>''x'' &minus; ''y''<nowiki>|</nowiki>}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} \n|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}\n|| {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} [[p-adic number|{{math|''p''}}-adic numbers]]\n|| {{math|''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|-\n| {{math|''F''(''t'')}} ({{math|''F''}} any field)\n|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation\n|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}\n|| {{math|''t''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|}\n\nThe field {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of [[complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them \"completely anomalous\".</ref>\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (can not be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} can ''not'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F''  \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]\nIf {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}, then the [[equation]] \n:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}\nhas a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]] form a Field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball can not be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the [[hairy ball theorem]] illustrated at the right.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikibooks|Abstract algebra|Fields}}\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation|title=Introduction to Field Theory| last=Adamson|first=I.
