Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, it still experiences [[flare star|star flare]] events, one being observed in 1998.\n\nThe star has also been the subject of some controversy. For a decade, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s, [[Peter van de Kamp]] argued that there were one or more [[gas giant]]s in orbit around it. Although the presence of small [[terrestrial planet]]s around Barnard's Star remains a possibility, Van de Kamp's specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Overview ==\nBarnard's Star is a red dwarf of the dim [[stellar classification|spectral type]] M4, and it is too faint to see without a [[telescope]].

The original list of Bayer designations contained 1,564 stars.\n\nMost of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names by the German [[astronomer]] [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603, in his star atlas ''[[Uranometria]]''. Bayer assigned a lower-case Greek letter (alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), etc.) or a Latin letter (A, b, c, etc.) to each star he catalogued, combined with the Latin name of the star's parent constellation in [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) form. (See [[88 modern constellations]] for the genitive forms.) For example, [[Aldebaran]] is designated ''\u03b1 Tauri'' (pronounced ''Alpha Tauri''), which means \"Alpha of [[Taurus (constellation)|the constellation Taurus]]\".<ref>The letters of the Greek alphabet were [[Greek numerals|used in antiquity as numerals]], however in a different way.</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |first=Johann |last=Bayer |title=Uranometria |chapter= \n |publisher=Archival Facsimiles  |year=1987 |isbn=1852970219\n |url=\n}}</ref>\n\nBayer used Greek letters for the brighter stars, but the Greek alphabet has only twenty-four letters, while a single constellation may contain fifty or more stars visible to the naked eye. When the Greek letters ran out, Bayer continued with Latin letters:  upper case ''A'', followed by lower case ''b'' through ''z'' (omitting ''j'' and ''v''), for a total of another 24 letters.<ref name=\"Ridpath\">{{cite book\n |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |title=Star Tales |chapter=Bayer's ''Uranometria'' and Bayer letters \n |publisher=Lutterworth Press |year=1989 |isbn=0718826957\n |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer.htm\n}}</ref>  Bayer never went beyond ''z'',<ref name=\"Ridpath\" /> but later astronomers added more designations using both upper and lower case Latin letters, the upper case letters following the lower case ones in general.  Examples include ''[[HD 90853|s Carinae]]'' (''s'' of [[Carina (constellation)|the constellation Carina]]), ''[[HD 117440|d Centauri]]'' (''d'' of [[Centaurus|the constellation Centaurus]]), ''[[G Scorpii]]'' (''G'' of [[Scorpius (constellation)|the constellation Scorpius]]), and ''[[HD 82668|N Velorum]]'' (''N'' of [[Vela (constellation)|the constellation Vela]]).  The last upper-case letter used in this way was ''Q''.\n\nBayer catalogued only a few stars too far south to be seen from Germany, but later astronomers (notably [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]] and [[Benjamin Apthorp Gould|Gould]]) supplemented Bayer's catalog with entries for southern constellations.\n\n== Order by magnitude class ==\n\nIn most constellations, Bayer assigned Greek and Latin letters to stars within a constellation in rough order of [[apparent magnitude|apparent brightness]], from brightest to dimmest. Since the brightest star in a majority of constellations is designated Alpha (\u03b1), many people wrongly assume that Bayer meant to order the stars exclusively by brightness. In Bayer's day, however, stellar brightness could not be measured precisely. Stars were traditionally assigned to one of six magnitude classes (the brightest to first magnitude, the dimmest to sixth), and Bayer typically ordered stars within a constellation by class: all the first-magnitude stars, followed by all the second-magnitude stars, and so on. Within each magnitude class, Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness.<ref name=jha17_50_189>{{cite journal\n | title=A Star Catalogue Used by Johannes Bayer\n | last=Swerdlow | first=N. M.\n | journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume=17 | issue=50 | pages=189&ndash;197 |date=August 1986 \n | bibcode=1986JHA....17..189S\n| doi=10.1177/002182868601700304 }} See p. 192.</ref> As a result, the brightest star in each class did not always get listed first in Bayer's order.\n\nBut in addition, Bayer did not always follow the magnitude class rule; he sometimes assigned letters to stars according to their location within a constellation, or  the order of their rising, or to historical or mythological details.  Occasionally the order looks quite arbitrary.<ref name=\"Ridpath\" />\n\nOf the 88 modern constellations, there are at least 30 in which \"Alpha\" is not the brightest star, and four of those lack an alpha star altogether. (Constellations with no alpha include [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and [[Puppis]] \u2013 both formerly part of [[Argo Navis]], whose alpha is [[Canopus]] in [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]].)\n\n==Bayer designations in Orion==\n[[Image:Orion constellation map.svg|300px|left|thumb|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] constellation map]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Bayer first designated Betelgeuse and Rigel, the two 1st-magnitude stars (those of magnitude 1.5 or less), as Alpha and Beta from north to south, with Betelgeuse (the shoulder) coming ahead of Rigel (the foot), even though the latter is usually the brighter. (Betelgeuse is a variable star and can at its maximum occasionally outshine Rigel.)<ref>Patrick Moore, ''Brilliant Stars'', 1996.</ref> Bayer then repeated the procedure for the stars of the 2nd magnitude (those between magnitudes 1.51 and 2.5), labeling them from ''gamma'' through ''zeta'' in \"top-down\" (north-to-south) order.\n\n==Various Bayer designation arrangements==\nThe \"First to Rise in the East\" order is used in a number of instances.  [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] may be an example of this: Pollux is brighter than Castor, but the latter rises earlier and was assigned ''alpha''. In this case, Bayer may also have been influenced by the traditional order of the mythological names \"[[Castor and Pollux]]\": Castor is generally named first whenever the twins are mentioned.\n\nAlthough the brightest star in Draco is Eltanin ([[Gamma Draconis]]), [[Thuban]] was assigned ''alpha'' (\u03b1) by Bayer because, due to [[precession]], Thuban was the [[pole star|north pole star]] 4,000 years ago.<ref name=\"MOORE\">{{Cite web| title=The Observer's Year: 366 Nights in the Universe| author=Moore, Patrick| page=283| year=2005}}</ref> Sometimes there is no apparent order, as exemplified by the stars in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], where Bayer's designations appear almost random to the modern eye. [[Alpha Sagittarii|Alpha]] and [[Beta Sagittarii]] are perhaps the most anomalously designated stars in the sky. They are more than two magnitudes fainter than the brightest star (designated [[Epsilon Sagittarii|Epsilon]]), they lie several degrees south of the main pattern (the \"teapot\" [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]), they are more than 20 degrees off the [[ecliptic]] in a [[Zodiac]]al constellation, and they do not even rise from Bayer's native Germany (while Epsilon and several other brighter stars do).  The order of the letters assigned in Sagittarius does correspond to the magnitudes as illustrated on Bayer's chart; but the latter do not agree with modern determinations of the magnitudes.\n\nBayer designations added by later astronomers generally were ordered by magnitude, but care was usually taken to avoid conflict with designations already assigned.  In Libra, for example, the new designations sigma, tau, and upsilon were chosen to avoid conflict with Bayer's earlier designations, even though several stars with earlier letters are not as bright.\n\n== Bayer's miscellaneous labels ==\n\nAlthough Bayer did not use upper-case Latin letters (except ''A'') for \"fixed stars\", he did use them to label other items shown on his charts, such as neighboring constellations, \"temporary stars\", miscellaneous astronomical objects, or reference lines like the Tropic of Cancer.<ref name=\"LostStars\">{{cite book\n |last = Wagman\n |first = Morton\n |date = 2003\n |title = Lost Stars\n |publisher = McDonald & Woodward\n |isbn = 0939923785\n}}</ref>{{rp|p. 131}}  In [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], for example, Bayer's fixed stars run through ''g'', and on this chart Bayer employs ''H'' through ''P'' as miscellaneous labels, mostly for neighboring constellations.  Bayer did not intend such labels as catalog designations, but some have survived to refer to astronomical objects:  [[P Cygni]] for example is still used as a designation for Nova Cyg 1600.  Tycho's Star ([[SN 1572]]), another \"temporary star\", appears as B Cassiopeiae.  In charts for constellations that did not exhaust the Greek letters, Bayer sometimes used the left-over Greek letters for miscellaneous labels as well.<ref name=\"LostStars\" />{{rp|p. 131}}\n\n==Revised Bayer designations==\n[[Ptolemy]] designated four stars as \"border stars\", each shared by two constellations: Alpheratz (in [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]), Elnath (in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]), Nu Bo\u00f6tis (in [[Bo\u00f6tes]] and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]]), and Fomalhaut (in [[Piscis Austrinus]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]).<ref name=\"LostStars\" />{{rp|p. 23}}  Bayer assigned the first three of these stars a Greek letter from both constellations: {{nowrap|[[Alpha Andromedae]] {{=}} Delta Pegasi}}, {{nowrap|[[Beta Tauri]] {{=}} Gamma Aurigae}}, and {{nowrap|[[Nu Bo\u00f6tis]] {{=}} Psi Herculis}}. (He catalogued Fomalhaut only once, as [[Fomalhaut|Alpha Piscis Austrini]].) When the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) assigned definite boundaries to the constellations in 1930, it declared that stars and other celestial objects can belong to only one constellation.  Consequently, the redundant second designation in each pair above has dropped out of use.\n\nBayer assigned two stars duplicate names by mistake: {{nowrap| [[Xi Arietis]]}} (duplicated as {{nowrap|Psi Ceti}}) and {{nowrap|[[Kappa Ceti]]}} (duplicated as {{nowrap|g Tauri}}).  He corrected these in a later atlas, and the duplicate names were no longer used.<ref name=\"LostStars\" />{{rp|p. 23}}\n\nOther cases of multiple Bayer designations arose when stars named by Bayer in one constellation were transferred by later astronomers to a different constellation.  Bayer's Gamma and Omicron Scorpii, for example, were later reassigned from [[Scorpius]] to [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] and given the new names [[Sigma Librae|Sigma]] and [[Upsilon Librae]].<ref name=\"LostStars\" />{{rp|p. 196}}  (To add to the confusion, the star now known as [[Omicron Scorpii]] was not named by Bayer but was assigned the designation o Scorpii (Latin lower case 'o') by Lacaille \u2013 which later astronomers misinterpreted as omicron once Bayer's omicron had been reassigned to Libra.)<ref name=\"LostStars\" />{{rp|p. 278}}\n\nA few stars no longer lie (according to the modern constellation boundaries) within the constellation for which they are named. The [[proper motion]] of [[Rho Aquilae]], for example, carried it across the boundary into [[Delphinus]] in 1992.\n\n==Bayer designation styles==\n\nBayer designations are most often written as the Greek or Latin letter followed by the standard 3-character constellation abbreviation: \u03b1 CMa, \u03b2 Per; or occasionally with the constellation genitive in full: \u03b1 Canis Majoris, \u03b2 Persei. Earlier 4-letter abbreviations (\u03b1 CMaj, \u03b2 Pers) are rarely used today. The Greek letter names are sometimes written out as well: [[Alpha Canis Majoris]], [[Beta Persei]].\n\n==Other Bayer designations==\nThe Latin-letter extended designations are not as commonly used as the Greek-letter ones (especially in constellations with [[Flamsteed designation]]s), but there are some exceptions such as [[h Persei]] (which is actually a [[star cluster]]) and [[P Cygni]]. Uppercase Latin Bayer designations in modern use do not go beyond Q; names such as [[R Leporis]] and [[W Ursae Majoris]] are [[variable star designation]]s, not Bayer designations.\n\nA further complication is the use of numeric superscripts to distinguish neighboring stars that Bayer (or a later astronomer) labeled with a common letter. Usually these are [[double star]]s (mostly optical doubles rather than true [[binary star]]s), but there are some exceptions such as the chain of stars [[Pi1 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>1</sup>]], [[Pi2 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>2</sup>]], [[Pi3 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>3</sup>]], [[Pi4 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>4</sup>]], [[Pi5 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>5</sup>]] and [[Pi6 Orionis|\u03c0<sup>6</sup>]] [[Pi Orionis|Orionis]].\n\n==Later letters==\nBayer did not label \"permanent\" stars with uppercase letters (except for ''A'', which he used in place of ''a''). However, a number of stars in southern constellations have upper-case letter designations, like [[B Centauri]] and [[G Scorpii]]. These letters were assigned by later astronomers, notably Lacaille in his ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum'' and Gould in his ''Uranometria Argentina''. Lacaille followed Bayer's use of Greek letters, but this was insufficient for many constellations.  He used first the lowercase letters, starting with ''a'', and if needed the uppercase letters, starting with ''A'', thus deviating somewhat from Bayer's practice. Lacaille used the Latin alphabet three times over in the large constellation [[Argo Navis]], once for each of the three areas that are now the constellations of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Puppis]], and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]. That was still insufficient for the number of stars, so he also used uppercase Latin letters such as [[HD 82668|N Velorum]] and [[Q Puppis]]. Lacaille assigned uppercase letters between R and Z in several constellations, but these have either been dropped to allow the assignment of those letters to variable stars or have actually turned out to be variable.<ref>{{cite book|title=Coelum australe stelliferum ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIo_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PP7|year=1763|publisher=H L Guerin & L F Delatour|pages=7\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Bayer objects|Bayer objects]]\n* [[Flamsteed designation]]\n* [[Gould designation]]\n* [[Lists of constellations]]\n* [[Star catalogue]]\n* [[Star designation]]\n* [[Table of stars with Bayer designations]]\n* [[Variable star designation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bayer Designation}}\n<!-- [[Category:Astronomy]] too general -->\n[[Category:Astronomical catalogues]]\n[[Category:Bayer objects|*]]", "sha1": "czu3264geleetojkzelg630ja0wwryz"}}, {"title": "Bo\u00f6tes", "ns": "0", "id": "4200", "revision": {"id": "866275976", "parentid": "852655170", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T11:13:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "comment": "Bluelink repaired", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the Northern constellation|the astronomical observatory|BOOTES}}\n{{Infobox constellation\n| name = Bo\u00f6tes\n| abbreviation = Boo\n| genitive = Bo\u00f6tis\n| pronounce = {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|\u02c8|o\u028a|t|i\u02d0|z}}, genitive {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|\u02c8|o\u028a|t|\u1d7b|s}}{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}}\n| symbolism = The Herdsman\n| RA = {{RA|13|36.1}} to {{RA|15|49.3}}{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Bo\u00f6tes}}\n| dec = +7.36\u00b0 to +55.1\u00b0{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Bo\u00f6tes}}\n| family = [[Ursa Major Family|Ursa Major]]\n| quadrant = NQ3\n| areatotal = 907\n| arearank = 13th\n| numbermainstars = 7, 15\n| numberbfstars = 59\n| numberstarsplanets = 10\n| numberbrightstars = 3\n| numbernearbystars = 3\n| brighteststarname = [[Arcturus]] (\u03b1 Boo)\n| starmagnitude = \u22120.04\n| neareststarname = [[Wolf 498]]\n| stardistancely = 17.71\n| stardistancepc = 5.43\n| numbermessierobjects = 0\n| meteorshowers = \n  {{plainlist |\n* [[January Bootids]]\n* [[June Bootids]]\n* [[Quadrantids]]\n  }}\n| bordering =\n  {{plainlist |\n* [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]\n* [[Ursa Major]]\n* [[Canes Venatici]]\n* [[Coma Berenices]]\n* [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]\n* [[Serpens|Serpens Caput]]\n* [[Corona Borealis]]\n* [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]]\n  }}\n| latmax = [[North Pole|90]]\n| latmin = [[50th parallel south|50]]\n| month = June\n| notes = '''Other designations:''' Arctophylax\n}}\n\n'''Bo\u00f6tes''' {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|\u02c8|o\u028a|t|i\u02d0|z}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, located between 0\u00b0 and +60\u00b0 [[declination]], and 13 and 16 hours of [[right ascension]] on the [[celestial sphere]].

It contains the [[List of brightest stars|fourth-brightest star]] in the night sky, the [[orange giant]] [[Arcturus]]. [[Epsilon Bootis]], or Izar, is a colourful [[multiple star]] popular with [[amateur astronomer]]s. Bo\u00f6tes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the [[naked eye]].\n\n== History and mythology ==\n\nIn [[Babylon|ancient Babylon]], the stars of Bo\u00f6tes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god [[Enlil]], who was the leader of the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian pantheon]] and special patron of farmers.{{sfn|White|2008|p=207}} Bo\u00f6tes may have been represented by the [[Foreleg of ox|foreleg]] constellation in ancient Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berio|first=Alessandro|year=2014|title=The Celestial River: Identifying the Ancient Egyptian Constellations|url=http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp253_ancient_egyptian_constellations.pdf|journal=Sino-Platonic Papers|volume=253|page=43}}</ref> According to this interpretation, the constellation depicts the shape of an animal foreleg. [[File:Bootes-foreleg.png|thumb|left|300px|The constellation of Bo\u00f6tes overlaid on the ancient Egyptian foreleg constellation.]]\n\nThe name ''Bo\u00f6tes'' was first used by [[Homer]] in his [[Odyssey]] as a celestial reference point for [[History of navigation#Antiquity|navigation]],<ref>Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 book 5, 272]</ref> described as \"late-setting\" or \"slow to set\", translated as the \"Plowman\".{{sfn|Mandelbaum|1990|p=103}} Exactly whom Bo\u00f6tes is supposed to represent in [[Greek mythology]] is not clear. According to one version, he was a son of [[Demeter]],<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> [[Philomenus]], twin brother of [[Plutus]], a plowman who drove the oxen in the constellation [[Ursa Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88\u201389}} This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means \"ox-driver\" or \"herdsman.\"<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> The ancient Greeks saw the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] now called the \"[[Big Dipper]]\" or \"Plough\" as a cart with oxen.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for \"noisy\" or \"ox-driver\".{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}} Another myth associated with Bo\u00f6tes relates that he invented the [[plow]] and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=133}}\n\nAnother myth associated with Bo\u00f6tes by [[Hyginus]] is that of [[Icarius]], who was [[apprentice|schooled]] as a [[vineyard|grape farmer]] and [[winemaker]] by [[Dionysus]]. Icarius made wine so strong that those who drank it appeared [[poisoning|poisoned]], which caused [[shepherd]]s to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Icarius' dog, brought his daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed [[suicide]]. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Bo\u00f6tes, Erigone as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and Maera as [[Canis Major]] or [[Canis Minor]].{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}}\n\nFollowing another reading, the constellation is identified with [[Arcas]] and also referred to as Arcas and [[Arcturus]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a [[wolf]] and [[resurrection|giving life back]] to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-[[bear]] by Zeus's wife [[Hera]], who was angry at Zeus's [[infidelity]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}} This is corroborated by the Greek name for Bo\u00f6tes, ''Arctophylax'', which means \"Bear Watcher\".{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}} \n\nCallisto, in the form of a bear was almost killed by her son, who was out hunting. Zeus rescued her, taking her into the sky where she became [[Ursa Major]], \"the Great Bear\". Arcturus, the name of the constellation's brightest star, comes from the Greek word meaning \"guardian of the bear\". Sometimes [[Arcturus]] is depicted as leading the [[hunting dog]]s of nearby [[Canes Venatici]] and driving the bears of Ursa Major and [[Ursa Minor]].<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref>\n\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bo\u00f6tes as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825.

[[Mons M\u00e6nalus]] can be seen at his feet.]]\n\nSeveral [[former constellations]] were formed from stars now included in Bo\u00f6tes. [[Quadrans Muralis]], the Quadrant, was a constellation created near [[Beta Bo\u00f6tis]] from faint stars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341\u2013342}} It was designated in 1795 by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande]], an astronomer who used a [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to perform detailed [[astrometry|astronometric measurements]]. Lalande worked with [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]] and others to predict the 1758 return of [[Halley's Comet]]. [[Quadrans Muralis]] was formed from the stars of eastern Bo\u00f6tes, western [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=51}} It was originally called ''Le Mural'' by [[Jean Fortin]] in his 1795 ''[[Atlas C\u00e9leste]]''; it was not given the name ''Quadrans Muralis'' until [[Johann Bode]]'s 1801 ''[[Uranographia]]''. The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude.{{sfn|Star Tales Quadrans Muralis}} [[Mons Maenalus]], representing the [[Maenalus]] mountains, was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687 at the foot of the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of Lycaon, [[Maenalus]]. The mountain, one of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s [[hunting|hunting grounds]], was also holy to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}}\n\n=== Non-Western astronomy ===\nThe stars of Bo\u00f6tes were incorporated into many different [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese constellations]]. Arcturus was part of the most prominent of these, variously designated as the celestial king's throne (''Tian Wang'') or the [[Azure Dragon|Blue Dragon]]'s horn (''Daijiao''); the name ''Daijiao'', meaning \"great horn\", is more common. Arcturus was given such importance in Chinese celestial mythology because of its status marking the beginning of the [[lunar calendar]], as well as its status as the brightest star in the northern night sky. \n\nTwo constellations flanked ''Daijiao'': ''Yousheti'' to the right and ''Zuosheti'' to the left; they represented companions that orchestrated the seasons. ''Zuosheti'' was formed from modern [[Zeta Bootis|Zeta]], [[Omicron Bootis|Omicron]], and [[Pi Bo\u00f6tis]], while ''Yousheti'' was formed from modern [[Eta Bootis|Eta]], [[Tau Bootis|Tau]], and [[Upsilon Bo\u00f6tis]]. ''Dixi'', the Emperor's ceremonial banquet mat, was north of Arcturus, consisting of the stars [[12 Bootis|12]], [[11 Bootis|11]], and [[9 Bo\u00f6tis]]. Another northern constellation was ''Qigong'', the [[Seven Dukes]], which mostly straddled the Bo\u00f6tes-Hercules border. It included either [[Delta Bo\u00f6tis]] or [[Beta Bo\u00f6tis]] as its terminus.{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}}\n\nThe other Chinese constellations made up of the stars of Bo\u00f6tes existed in the modern constellation's north; they are all representations of weapons. ''Tianqiang'', the [[spear]], was formed from [[Iota Bootis|Iota]], [[Kappa Bootis|Kappa]], and [[Theta Bo\u00f6tis]]; ''Genghe'', variously representing a [[lance]] or [[shield]], was formed from [[Epsilon Bootis|Epsilon]], [[Rho Bootis|Rho]], and [[Sigma Bo\u00f6tis]]. \n\nThere were also two weapons made up of a singular star. ''Xuange'', the [[halberd]], was represented by [[Lambda Bo\u00f6tis]], and ''Zhaoyao'', either the [[sword]] or the spear, was represented by [[Gamma Bo\u00f6tis]].{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}}\n\nTwo Chinese constellations have an uncertain placement in Bo\u00f6tes. ''Kangchi'', the lake, was placed south of Arcturus, though its specific location is disputed. It may have been placed entirely in Bo\u00f6tes, on either side of the Bo\u00f6tes-Virgo border, or on either side of the Virgo-Libra border. The constellation ''Zhouding'', a bronze [[tripod]]-mounted container used for food, was sometimes cited as the stars [[1 Bootis|1]], [[2 Bootis|2]], and [[6 Bo\u00f6tis]]. However, it has also been associated with three stars in [[Coma Berenices]].{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}}\n\nBo\u00f6tes is also known to [[Native American culture]]s. In [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik|Yup'ik]], Bo\u00f6tes is ''Taluyaq'', literally \"[[fish trap]],\" and the funnel-shaped part of the fish trap is known as ''Ilulirat.''{{sfn|Jacobson 2012}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nBo\u00f6tes is a constellation bordered by Virgo to the south, [[Coma Berenices]] and Canes Venatici to the west, Ursa Major to the northwest, Draco to the northeast, and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], [[Corona Borealis]] and [[Serpens Caput]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Boo'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 segments.

[[Aratus]] described him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding the reins of his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}} After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Bo\u00f6tes was often depicted standing on the [[Peloponnese]] mountain.{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}} By 1801, when Johann Bode published his ''Uranographia'', Bo\u00f6tes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Bo\u00f6tes}}\n\nThe placement of Arcturus has also been mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him.

It was discovered in January 1835 and named in 1864 by Alexander Hershell.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357\u2013368}} The [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is located in northern Bo\u00f6tes near Kappa Bo\u00f6tis,{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=612}} in its namesake former constellation of [[Quadrans Muralis]]. Quadrantid meteors are dim, but have a peak visible hourly rate of approximately 100 per hour on January 3\u20134.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132\u2013133}} The [[zenithal hourly rate]] of the Quadrantids is approximately 130 meteors per hour at their peak; it is also a very narrow shower. \n\nThe Quadrantids are notoriously difficult to observe because of a low radiant and often inclement weather. The parent body of the meteor shower has been disputed for decades;{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357\u2013368}} however, [[Peter Jenniskens]] has proposed [[2003 EH1|2003 EH<sub>1</sub>]], a minor planet, as the parent.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=368}} 2003 EH<sub>1</sub> may be linked to [[C/1490 Y1|C/1490 Y<sub>1</sub>]], a comet previously thought to be a potential parent body for the Quadrantids.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=373}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=376}} \n\n2003 EH<sub>1</sub> is a [[short-period comet]] of the [[Jupiter family comet|Jupiter family]]; 500 years ago, it experienced a catastrophic breakup event. It is now dormant.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}} The Quadrantids had notable displays in 1982, 1985, and 2004.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=49}} Meteors from this shower often appear to have a blue hue and travel at a moderate speed of 41.5\u201343 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=104}}\n\nOn April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid [[Alpha Bootids]] was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6&nbsp;cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near [[Arcturus]] with a diameter of less than 1\u00b0. [[Peter Jenniskens]] comments that this outburst resembled a \"typical dust trail crossing\".{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=199}} The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27 and 28, and finishing on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second.{{sfn|IAU Alpha Bootids}} They may be related to Comet [[73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3]], but this connection is only theorized.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}}\n\n[[File:QUADRANTID meteor on January 3 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A bright Quadrantid observed at twilight.]]\n\nThe [[June Bootids]], also known as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower associated with the comet [[7P/Pons-Winnecke]], first recognized on May 27, 1916, by William F. Denning.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=334}} The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because Earth did not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 [[astronomical unit]]s of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed. \n\nIn 1982, E. A. Reznikov discovered that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=335}} Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit was not in a favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of meteors radiating from Bo\u00f6tes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest meteors lasting several seconds at times. Many [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s, green-hued trails, and even some meteors that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200\u2013300 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=336\u2013337}} \n\nTwo Russian astronomers determined in 2002 that material ejected from the comet in 1825 was responsible for the 1998 outburst.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=338}} [[Ejecta]] from the comet dating to 1819, 1825, and 1830 was predicted to enter Earth's atmosphere on June 23, 2004. The predictions of a shower less spectacular than the 1998 showing were borne out in a display that had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 16\u201320 meteors per hour that night. The June Bootids are not expected to have another outburst in the next 50 years.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=339\u2013344}} \n\nTypically, only 1\u20132 dim, very slow meteors are visible per hour; the average June Bootid has a magnitude of 5.0. It is related to the [[Alpha Draconids]] and the [[Bootids-Draconids]]. The shower lasts from June 27 to July 5, with a peak on the night of June 28.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=113}} The June Bootids are classified as a class III shower (variable),{{sfn|AMS 2012 List}} and has an average entry velocity of 18 kilometers per second. Its radiant is located 7 degrees north of Beta Bo\u00f6tis.{{sfn|AMS June 23}}\n\nThe [[Beta Bootids]] is a weak shower that begins on January 5, peaks on January 16, and ends on January 18. Its meteors travel at 43 kilometers/second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=105}} The [[January Bootids]] is a short, young meteor shower that begins on January 9, peaks from January 16 to January 18, and ends on January 18.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} \n\nThe [[Phi Bootids]] is another weak shower radiating from Bo\u00f6tes. It begins on April 16, peaks on April 30 and May 1, and ends on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 15.1&nbsp;km/s. They were discovered in 2006.{{sfn|IAU Phi Bootids}} The shower's peak hourly rate can be as high as 6 meteors per hour. Though named for a star in Bo\u00f6tes, the Phi Bootid radiant has moved into [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].{{sfn|Koed|Sherrod|2003|p=52}} The meteor stream is associated with three different asteroids: [[1620 Geographos]], [[2062 Aten]], and [[1978 CA]].{{sfn|\u0160tohl|Porub\u010dan|1993|p=43}} \n\nThe [[Lambda Bootids]], part of the [[Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex]], are a weak annual shower with moderately fast meteors; 41.75&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Lambda Bootids}} The complex includes the Lambda Bootids, as well as the [[Theta Coronae Borealids]] and [[Xi Coronae Borealids]].{{sfn|IAU Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex}}{{sfn|Green|2007}} All of the Bootid-Coronae Borealid showers are [[Jupiter family comet]] showers; the streams in the complex have highly inclined orbits.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}}\n\nThere are several minor showers in Bo\u00f6tes, some of whose existence is yet to be verified. The [[Rho Bootids]] radiate from near the namesake star, and were hypothesized in 2010.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}} The average Rho Bootid has an entry velocity of 43&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}}{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} It peaks in November and lasts for 3 days. \n\nThe Rho Bootid shower is part of the [[SMA complex]], a group of meteor showers related to the [[Taurids]], which is in turn linked to the comet [[2P/Encke]]. However, the link to the Taurid shower remains unconfirmed and may be a chance correlation.{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} Another such shower is the [[Gamma Bootids]], which were hypothesized in 2006. Gamma Bootids have an entry velocity of 50.3&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Gamma Bootids}} The [[Nu Bootids]], hypothesized in 2012, have faster meteors, with an entry velocity of 62.8&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Nu Bootids}}\n\n== References ==\n\n'''Citations'''\n\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n'''References'''\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delsct|title=Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti Variables|last=Templeton|first=Matthew |date=16 July 2010|work=Variable Star of the Season|publisher=AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers)|accessdate=3 November 2012|ref={{sfnRef|AAVSO Delta Scuti Variables}} }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=4507|title=Gamma Bo\u00f6tis |author =Watson, Christopher |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=5 August 2014   | ref = {{sfnRef|AAVSO Gamma Bo\u00f6tis}} }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=45321|title=NSV 6697 |author =Watson, Christopher |date=3 May 2013 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=8 August 2014   | ref = {{sfnRef|AAVSO Rho Bo\u00f6tis}} }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=45341|title=NSV 6717 |author =Watson, Christopher |date=18 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=8 August 2014   | ref = {{sfnRef|AAVSO Sigma Bo\u00f6tis}} }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=4357|title=ZZ Bo\u00f6tis |author =Watson, Christopher |date=4 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=5 August 2014   | ref = {{sfnRef|AAVSO ZZ Bo\u00f6tis}} }}\n* {{cite journal| doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20077314| last1 = Da Silva| first1 = R.| last2 = Udry| first2 = S.| last3 = Bouchy| first3 = F.| last4 = Moutou| first4 = C.| last5 = Mayor| first5 = M.| last6 = Beuzit| first6 = J.-L.| last7 = Bonfils| first7 = X.| last8 = Delfosse| first8 = X.| last9 = Desort| first9 = M.| title = ELODIE metallicity-biased search for transiting Hot Jupiters IV.

From 1510 he studied medicine at [[Perugia]].\n\n===Transfer to the Capuchins===\n[[File:Ochino.jpg|thumb|left|Bernardino Ochino in an old engraving.]]\nAt the age of 38, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]]. By then he was the close friend of [[Juan de Vald\u00e9s]], [[Pietro Bembo]], [[Vittoria Colonna]], [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Pietro Martire]], [[Pietro Carnesecchi|Carnesecchi]]. In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order. In 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited [[Venice]] and delivered a course of [[sermon]]s showing a sympathy with [[justification by faith]], which appeared more clearly in his ''Dialogues'' published the same year. He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the [[Inquisition]] in [[Rome]] in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal [[Pope Paul IV|Giovanni Pietro Carafa]]. Ochino received a citation to [[Rome]], and set out to obey it about the middle of August.  According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of [[Gasparo Contarini|Cardinal Contarini]], whom he found at [[Bologna]], dying of [[poison]] administered by the reactionary party.\n\n===Escape to Geneva===\nOchino turned aside to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and after some hesitation went across the [[Alps]] to [[Geneva]].  He was cordially received by [[John Calvin]], and published within two years several volumes of ''Prediche'', controversial tracts rationalizing his change of [[religion]].  He also addressed replies to marchioness [[Vittoria Colonna]], [[Claudio Tolomei]], and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself. His own breach with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was final.\n\n===Augsburg and England===\nIn 1545 Ochino became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at [[Augsburg]]. From this time dates his contact with [[Caspar Schwenckfeld]]. He was compelled to flee when, in January 1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the [[Diet of Augsburg]].\n\nOchino found asylum in England, where he was made a [[prebendary]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], received a [[pension]] from [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] privy purse, and composed his major work, the ''Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome''. This text, originally written in [[Latin]], is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop [[John Ponet]]. The form is a series of dialogues.  [[Lucifer]], enraged at the spread of [[Jesus]]'s kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the [[pope]] as [[antichrist]].  The state, represented by the emperor [[Phocas]], is persuaded to connive at the pope's assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifer's projects seem fully accomplished, when [[Heaven]] raises up [[Henry VIII of England]] and his son for their overthrow.\n\nSeveral of Ochino's ''Prediche'' were translated into English by [[Anne Bacon|Anna Cooke]]; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent. Ochino\u2019s ''Che Cosa \u00e8 Christo'' was translated into Latin and English by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1547.<ref> Mueller, Janel & Scodel, Joshua, eds, ''Elizabeth I: Translations, 1544-1589'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009)</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich===\nIn 1553 the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] drove Ochino from England. He went to Basel, where [[Lelio Sozzini]] and the lawyer [[Martino Muralto]] were sent to secure Ochino as pastor of the Italian church at [[Z\u00fcrich]], which Ochino accepted. The Italian congregation there was composed mainly of refugees from [[Locarno]]. There for 10 years Ochino wrote books which gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the [[orthodoxy]] around him.  The most important of these was the ''Labyrinth'', a discussion of the [[free will|freedom of the will]], covertly undermining the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] doctrine of [[predestination]].\n\nIn 1563 a long simmering storm burst on Ochino with the publication of his ''Thirty Dialogues'', in one of which his adversaries maintained that he had justified [[polygamy]] under the disguise of a pretended refutation.  His dialogues on [[divorce]] and against the [[Trinity]] were also considered heretical.\n\n===Poland, and death===\nOchino was not given opportunity to defend himself, and was banished from Z\u00fcrich. After being refused admission by other Protestant cities, he directed his steps towards Poland, at that time the most tolerant state in Europe.  He had not resided there long when an edict appeared (August 8, 1564) banishing all foreign [[dissident]]s.  Fleeing the country, he encountered the [[Black Death|plague]] at [[Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w]]; three of his four children were carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, died in solitude and obscurity at [[Slavkov u Brna|Slavkov]] in [[Moravia]], about the end of 1564.\n\n==Legacy==\nOchino's reputation among Protestants was low. He was charged by [[Thomas Browne]] in 1643<ref>\"Ce monstre d'homme, ce secr\u00e9taire de l'enfer, en un mot, l'auteur de l'abominable livre des trois imposteurs\" (Thomas Browne, Religio medici, 1643, 1e partie, section 19. Cit\u00e9 par Georges Minois, Le Trait\u00e9 des trois imposteurs, Albin Michel, 2009, p. 85 et p. 310, n. 35.)</ref> with the authorship of the legendary-apocryphal heretical treatise ''[[The Treatise of the Three Impostors|De tribus Impostoribus]]'', as well as with having carried his alleged approval of polygamy into practice.\n\nHis biographer [[Karl Benrath]] justified him, representing him as a fervent [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry. The picture is of Ochino always learning and unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues, frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction. \n\n==Works==\n*''Prediche'' (1542)\n*''Epistola alli Signori di Balia della citt\u00e0 di Siena'' (1543)\n*''Responsio ad Marcum Brixiensem Abbatem Ordinis S.

The bay is subject to [[algae bloom]]s in late summer which are a naturally occurring phenomenon and do not indicate pollution other than from agricultural runoff.  [[Zebra mussel]]s as well as the other invasive species found in the great lakes are present.\n\nThe Quinte area played a vital role in bootlegging during [[Prohibition in the United States]], with large volumes of booze being produced in the area, and shipped via boat on the Bay to [[Lake Ontario]] finally arriving in New York State where it was distributed.  Illegal sales of liquor accounted for many fortunes in and around [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]].\n\nTourism in the area is significant, especially in the summer months due to the Bay of Quinte and its fishing, local golf courses, provincial parks, and wineries.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:BayofQuinteMap-1108.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Map of the Bay of Quinte Area (City of Belleville is shaded green)]]\nThe northern side of the bay is defined by Ontario's mainland, while the southern side follows the shore of the Prince Edward County headland. Beginning in the east with the outlet to Lake Ontario, the bay runs west-southwest for 25 kilometres to [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] (although this section is also called Adolphus Reach), where it turns north-northwest for another 20 kilometres as far as [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]]. From there it turns south-southwest again for another 40 kilometres, running past [[Big Island (Bay of Quinte)|Big Island]] on the south and [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on the north. The width of the bay rarely exceeds two kilometres. The bay ends at [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] ([[Quinte West, Ontario|Quinte West]]) and the [[Trent River (Ontario)|Trent River]], both also on the north side. The [[Murray Canal]] has been cut through the \"Carrying Place\", the few miles separating the end of the bay and Lake Ontario on the west side.

Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century, the bassoon figures prominently in [[orchestra]]l, [[concert band]], and [[chamber music]] literature. The bassoon is a non-[[transposing instrument]] known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range, variety of character and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy [[timbre]] to that of a male [[baritone]] voice. Someone who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word bassoon comes from French ''basson'' and from Italian ''bassone'' (''basso'' with the augmentative suffix ''-one'').<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bassoon |title=Bassoon|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> However, the Italian name for the same instrument is ''fagotto'', in Spanish and Romanian it is ''fagot'', and in German ''fagott''.<ref>http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/bassoon</ref> Fagot is a Germanic word meaning a bundle of sticks.<ref>http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fagot</ref>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Range bassoon.svg|thumb|[[Range (music)|Playing range]] of a bassoon<br />(A<sub>1</sub>) '''B{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>''' (A<sub>5</sub>)<br />({{Audio|Bassoon-technical-range.ogg|listen}})]]\n:(A<sub>1</sub>) '''B{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>\u2013C<sub>5</sub>''' (D<sub>5</sub>\u2013G<sub>5</sub>)\nThe range of the bassoon begins at B{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> (the first one below the [[bass staff]]) and extends upward over three [[octave]]s, roughly to the G above the treble staff (G<sub>5</sub>).<ref>[http://www.wfg.woodwind.org/bassoon/basn_alt_3.html Third Octave \u2013 Alternate Fingering Chart for Heckel-System Bassoon \u2013 The Woodwind Fingering Guide].

The bell <span style=\"color:red;\">(6)</span>, extending upward; the bass joint (or long joint) <span style=\"color:red;\">(5)</span>, connecting the bell and the boot; the boot (or butt) <span style=\"color:red;\">(4)</span>, at the bottom of the instrument and folding over on itself; the wing joint (or tenor joint) <span style=\"color:red;\">(3)</span>, which extends from boot to bocal; and the [[bocal]] (or crook) <span style=\"color:red;\">(2)</span>, a crooked metal tube that attaches the wing joint to a reed <span style=\"color:red;\">(1)</span> ({{Audio|Bassoon-technical-reed.ogg|listen}}). Bassoons are double reed instruments like the [[oboe]].\n\nA modern beginner's bassoon is generally made of [[maple]], with medium-hardness types such as [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore maple]] and [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of materials such as [[polypropylene]] and [[ebonite]], primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons were made in the past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The [[Bore (wind instruments)|bore]] of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the [[saxophone]], and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected at the bottom of the instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and [[tone hole]]s are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also [[stain]]ed and [[varnish]]ed. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or [[ivory]]. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.\n\nFolded upon itself, the bassoon stands {{Convert|1.34|m|abbr=on}} tall, but the total sounding length is {{Convert|2.54|m|abbr=on}}. Playing is facilitated by doubling the tube back on itself and by closing the distance between the widely spaced holes with a complex system of key work, which extends throughout nearly the entire length of the instrument. There are also short-reach bassoons made for the benefit of young or petite players.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Praetorius bassoons.jpg|thumb|Dulcians and [[rackett]]s, from the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]].]]\nMusic historians generally consider the [[dulcian]] to be the forerunner of the modern bassoon,<ref>{{cite book |title=Classical Music: The Listener's Companion |last=Morin |first=Alexander J. |author2=Harold C. Schonberg |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |location=San Francisco |isbn= |page=1154 }}. \"Its direct ancestor is the dulcian, a hairpin-shaped instrument with a long, folded bore and a single key; developed in the first half of the 16th century, it remained in use until the 17th.\"</ref> as the two instruments share many characteristics: a double reed fitted to a metal crook, obliquely drilled tone holes and a conical bore that doubles back on itself. The origins of the dulcian are obscure, but by the mid-16th century it was available in as many as eight different sizes, from [[soprano]] to great bass. A full consort of dulcians was a rarity; its primary function seems to have been to provide the bass in the typical wind band of the time, either loud ([[shawm]]s) or soft ([[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s), indicating a remarkable ability to vary [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] to suit the need. Otherwise, dulcian technique was rather primitive, with eight finger holes and two keys, indicating that it could play in only a limited number of key signatures.\n\nThe dulcian came to be known as ''[[:wiktionary:fagotto|fagotto]]'' in Italy. However, the usual etymology that equates ''fagotto'' with \"[[:wiktionary:faggot|bundle of sticks]]\" is somewhat misleading, as the latter term did not come into general use until later. Some think it may resemble the Roman [[Fasces]], a standard of bound sticks with an ax.<ref>[http://cache.eb.com/eb/image?id=95620&rendTypeId=4 Facis Image]. None. Retrieved on 2012-05-25.</ref><ref>Jansen, 1978</ref> A further discrepancy lies in the fact that the dulcian was carved out of a single block of wood\u2014in other words, a single \"stick\" and not a bundle.\n\nCircumstantial evidence indicates that the [[baroque]] bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece ''fl\u00fbte traversi\u00e8re'' ([[flute#Western transverse flutes|transverse flute]]) and the ''hautbois'' ([[Oboe#History|baroque oboe]]). Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass joint, boot and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to [[B\u266d (musical note)|B{{Music|b}}]] by adding two [[Key (instrument)|keys]].<ref>Lange and Thomson, 1979</ref> An alternate view maintains Hotteterre was one of several craftsmen responsible for the development of the early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time.<ref>Kopp, 1999</ref> No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of [[Johann Christoph Denner]] and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key ([[G\u266f (musical note)|G\u266f]]) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]], Bach, and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low [[E\u266d (musical note)|E{{Music|b}}]], was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678\u20131769), J. Poerschmann (1680\u20131757), [[Thomas Stanesby|Thomas Stanesby, Jr]]. (1668\u20131734), G.H. Scherer (1703\u20131778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732\u20131786).\n\n===Modern history===\nIncreasing demands on capabilities of instruments and players in the 19th century\u2014particularly larger concert halls requiring greater volume and the rise of virtuoso composer-performers\u2014spurred further refinement. Increased sophistication, both in manufacturing techniques and acoustical knowledge, made possible great improvements in the instrument's playability.\n\nThe modern bassoon exists in two distinct primary forms, the Buffet system and the Heckel system. Most of the world plays the Heckel system, while the Buffet system is primarily played in France, Belgium, and parts of [[Latin America]]. A number of other types of bassoons have been constructed by various instrument makers, such as the rare [[Galandronome]].\n\n====Heckel (German) system<!--linked from 'Guntram Wolf'-->====\n[[File:Bassoon 1870.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Adam Heckel|Heckel]] system bassoon from 1870]]\nThe design of the modern bassoon owes a great deal to the performer, teacher, and composer [[Carl Almenr\u00e4der]]. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher [[Gottfried Weber]], he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four octaves. Almenr\u00e4der's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the keywork. Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. His employment at [[Schott Music|Schott<!-- at the time named \"B. Schott's S\u00f6hne\" -->]] gave him the freedom to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in ''Caecilia'', Schott's house journal. Almenr\u00e4der continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. In 1831, Almenr\u00e4der left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, [[Johann Adam Heckel]].\n\nHeckel and two generations of descendants continued to refine the bassoon, and their instruments became the standard, with other makers following. Because of their superior singing tone quality (an improvement upon one of the main drawbacks of the Almenr\u00e4der instruments), the Heckel instruments competed for prominence with the reformed Wiener system, a [[Boehm system|Boehm]]-style bassoon, and a completely keyed instrument devised by [[Charles-Joseph Sax]], father of [[Adolphe Sax]]. F.W. Kruspe implemented a latecomer attempt in 1893 to reform the [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] system, but it failed to catch on. Other attempts to improve the instrument included a 24-keyed model and a single-reed [[Mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]], but both these had adverse effects on tone and were abandoned.\n\nComing into the 20th century, the Heckel-style German model of bassoon dominated the field. Heckel himself had made over 1,100 instruments by the turn of the 20th century (serial numbers begin at 3,000), and the British makers' instruments were no longer desirable for the changing [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] requirements of the symphony orchestra, remaining primarily in [[military band]] use.\n\n[[File:FoxBassoon.png|thumb|upright|Two views of a Fox model 220 bassoon.]]\nExcept for a brief 1940s wartime conversion to [[ball bearing]] manufacture, the Heckel concern has produced instruments continuously to the present day. Heckel bassoons are considered by many to be the best, although a range of Heckel-style instruments is available from several other manufacturers, all with slightly different playing characteristics.\n\nBecause its mechanism is primitive compared to most modern woodwinds, makers have occasionally attempted to \"reinvent\" the bassoon. In the 1960s, [[Giles Brindley]] began to develop what he called the \"logical bassoon,\" which aimed to improve intonation and evenness of tone through use of an electrically activated mechanism, making possible key combinations too complex for the human hand to manage. Brindley's logical bassoon was never marketed.\n\n====Buffet (French) system====\nThe Buffet system bassoon achieved its basic acoustical properties somewhat earlier than the Heckel. Thereafter, it continued to develop in a more conservative manner. While the early history of the Heckel bassoon included a complete overhaul of the instrument in both [[acoustics]] and key work, the development of the Buffet system consisted primarily of incremental improvements to the key work. This minimalist approach of the Buffet deprived it of improved consistency of intonation, ease of operation, and increased power, which is found in Heckel bassoons, but the Buffet is considered by some to have a more vocal and expressive quality. The conductor [[John Foulds]] lamented in 1934 the dominance of the Heckel-style bassoon, considering them too homogeneous in sound with the [[French horn|horn]]. The modern Buffet system has 22 keys with its range being about the same as the Heckel.\n\nCompared to the Heckel bassoon, Buffet system bassoons have a narrower bore and simpler mechanism, requiring different fingerings for many notes. Switching between Heckel and Buffet requires extensive retraining. Buffet instruments are known for a reedier sound and greater facility in the [[Register (music)|upper registers]], reaching e<nowiki>''</nowiki> and f<nowiki>''</nowiki> with far greater ease and less air resistance. French woodwind instruments' tone in general exhibits a certain amount of \"edge,\" with more of a vocal quality than is usual elsewhere, and the Buffet bassoon is no exception. This type of sound can be beneficial in music by French composers, but has drawn criticism for being too intrusive. As with all bassoons, the tone varies considerably, depending on individual instrument and performer. In the hands of a lesser player, the Heckel bassoon can sound flat and woody, but good players succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone. Conversely, a poorly played Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal, but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound, different from\u2014but not inferior to\u2014the Heckel.\n\nThough the United Kingdom once favored the French system,<ref>Langwill, 1965</ref> Buffet-system instruments are no longer made there and the last prominent British player of the French system retired in the 1980s. However, with continued use in some regions and its distinctive tone, the Buffet continues to have a place in modern bassoon playing, particularly in France, where it originated. Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by [[Buffet Crampon]] and the atelier Ducasse (Romainville, France). The Selmer Company stopped fabrication of French system bassoons around the year 2012.<ref>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227110642/http://www.selmer.fr/categorie.php?famille=SELMER%20CLAR | archivedate=27 February 2012 | url=http://www.selmer.fr/categorie.php?famille=SELMER%20CLAR | publisher=Selmer | title=Instruments / Clarinets | accessdate=7 June 2018 }}</ref> Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.\n\n==Use in ensembles==\n\n===Earlier ensembles===\nOrchestras first used the bassoon to reinforce the bass line, and as the bass of the double reed choir (oboes and taille). Baroque composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and his ''Les Petits Violons'' included oboes and bassoons along with the strings in the 16-piece (later 21-piece) ensemble, as one of the first orchestras to include the newly invented double reeds. [[Antonio Cesti]] included a bassoon in his 1668 opera ''[[Il pomo d'oro]]'' (The Golden Apple). However, use of bassoons in concert orchestras was sporadic until the late 17th century when double reeds began to make their way into standard instrumentation. This was largely due to the spread of the ''hautbois'' to countries outside France. Increasing use of the bassoon as a ''[[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]'' instrument meant that it began to be included in [[opera]] orchestras, first in France and later in Italy, Germany and England. Meanwhile, composers such as [[Joseph Bodin de Boismortier]], [[Michel Corrette]], [[Johann Ernst Galliard]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Johann Friedrich Fasch]] and Telemann wrote demanding solo and ensemble music for the instrument. Antonio Vivaldi brought the bassoon to prominence by featuring it in 37 [[Concerto|concerti]] for the instrument.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, the bassoon's function in the orchestra was still mostly limited to that of a continuo instrument\u2014since scores often made no specific mention of the bassoon, its use was implied, particularly if there were parts for oboes or other winds. Beginning in the early [[Rococo]] era, composers such as [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]] and [[Johann Stamitz]] included parts that exploited the bassoon for its unique color, rather than for its perfunctory ability to double the bass line. Orchestral works with fully independent parts for the bassoon would not become commonplace until the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter]]'' symphony is a prime example, with its famous bassoon solos in the first [[Movement (music)|movement]]. The bassoons were generally paired, as in current practice, though the famed [[Mannheim school|Mannheim orchestra]] boasted four.\n\nAnother important use of the bassoon during the Classical era was in the ''[[Harmonie]]'', a chamber ensemble consisting of pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons; later, two [[clarinet]]s would be added to form an octet. The ''Harmonie'' was an ensemble maintained by German and Austrian noblemen for private music-making, and was a cost-effective alternative to a full orchestra. Haydn, Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and [[Franz Krommer]] all wrote considerable amounts of music for the ''Harmonie''.\n\n===Modern ensembles===\n\nThe modern symphony orchestra typically calls for two bassoons, often with a third playing the [[contrabassoon]]. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'' and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''. Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the [[viola]]s and [[cello]]s) in the overture to ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and [[double bass]]es, and [[harmonic]] support along with the French horns.\n[[File:Edgar Degas - The Orchestra at the Opera - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Edgar Degas]], ''L'Orchestre de L'Opera'', (1868)]]\nA [[concert band|wind ensemble]] will usually also include two bassoons and sometimes contrabassoon, each with independent parts; other types of concert wind ensembles will often have larger sections, with many players on each of first or second parts; in simpler arrangements there will be only one bassoon part and no contrabassoon. The bassoon's role in the concert band is similar to its role in the orchestra, though when scoring is thick it often cannot be heard above the brass instruments also in its range. ''La Fiesta Mexicana'', by [[H. Owen Reed]], features the instrument prominently, as does the transcription of [[Malcolm Arnold]]'s ''[[Four Scottish Dances]]'', which has become a staple of the concert band repertoire.\n\nThe bassoon is part of the standard [[wind quintet]] instrumentation, along with the flute, oboe, clarinet, and horn; it is also frequently combined in various ways with other woodwinds. [[Richard Strauss]]'s \"Duet-Concertino\" pairs it with the clarinet as ''concertante'' instruments, with string orchestra in support. An ensemble known as the \"reed quintet\" also makes use of the bassoon. A reed quintet is made up of an oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bass clarinet, and bassoon.\n\nThe bassoon quartet has also gained favor in recent times. The bassoon's wide range and variety of tone colors make it well suited to grouping in a like-instrument ensemble. [[Peter Schickele]]'s \"Last Tango in Bayreuth\" (after themes from ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'') is a popular work; Schickele's fictional alter ego [[P. D. Q. Bach]] exploits the more humorous aspects with his quartet \"Lip My Reeds,\" which at one point calls for players to perform on the reed alone. It also calls for a low [[A (musical note)|A]] at the very end of the prelude section in the fourth bassoon part. It is written so that the first bassoon does not play; instead, the player's role is to place an extension in the bell of the fourth bassoon so that the note can be played.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe bassoon is infrequently used as a [[jazz]] instrument and rarely seen in a [[Jazz band|jazz ensemble]]. It first began appearing in the 1920s, including specific calls for its use in [[Paul Whiteman]]'s group, the unusual [[Octet (music)|octets]] of [[Alec Wilder]], and a few other session appearances. The next few decades saw the instrument used only sporadically, as symphonic jazz fell out of favor, but the 1960s saw artists such as [[Yusef Lateef]] and [[Chick Corea]] incorporate bassoon into their recordings. Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition (see, e.g., ''[[The Centaur and the Phoenix]]'' (1960) which features bassoon as part of a 6-man horn section, including a few solos) while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with [[flautist]] [[Hubert Laws]].\n\nMore recently, [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Ray Pizzi]], [[Frank Tiberi]], and [[Marshall Allen]] have both doubled on bassoon in addition to their saxophone performances. Bassoonist [[Karen Borca]], a performer of [[free jazz]], is one of the few jazz musicians to play only bassoon; [[Michael Rabinowitz]], the Spanish bassoonist [[Javier Abad]], and [[James Lassen]], an American resident in [[Bergen]], Norway, are others. [[Katherine Young (musician)|Katherine Young]] plays the bassoon in the ensembles of [[Anthony Braxton]]. [[Lindsay Cooper]], [[Paul Hanson]], the Brazilian bassoonist [[Alexandre Silv\u00e9rio]], [[Trent Jacobs]] and [[Daniel Smith (bassoonist)|Daniel Smith]] are also currently using the bassoon in jazz.

However, several 1960s pop music hits feature the bassoon, including \"[[The Tears of a Clown]]\" by [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]] (the bassoonist was Charles R. Sirard<ref>[http://www.idrs.org/resources/whoswho/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=12745 \"Charles Sirad\" at International Double Reed Society]</ref>), \"[[Jennifer Juniper]]\" by [[Donovan]], \"[[The Turtles]]\" \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\"(third verse,overdub),   \"[[The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)|59th Street Bridge Song]]\" by [[Harpers Bizarre]], and the oompah bassoon underlying [[The New Vaudeville Band]]'s \"[[Winchester Cathedral (song)|Winchester Cathedral]]\". From 1974 to 1978, the bassoon was played by [[Lindsay Cooper]] in the British [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde band]] [[Henry Cow]]. In the 1970s it was played, in the British medieval/[[progressive rock]] band [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]], by Brian Gulland, as well as by the American band [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], where it was played by drummer Burleigh Drummond. The Belgian [[Rock in Opposition]]-band [[Univers Zero]] is also known for its use of the bassoon.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]] provided bassoon for the alternative metal band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] as did Aimee DeFoe, in what is self-described as \"grouchily lilting garage bassoon\" in the indie-rock band [[Blogurt]] from [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://www.blogurt.com Blogurt, official website].

Played by UK bassoonist Louise Watson, the bassoon is heard in the tracks \"Cold\" and \"Mr Skeng\" as a compliment to the electronic synthesizer bass lines typically found in this genre.\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Bassoon2 (PSF).jpg|left|150px|alt=Female bassoon player]]\n{{listen\n|header=A collection of samples demonstrating the bassoon's range, abilities, and tone.\n|filename     = Bassoon-technical-range.ogg\n|title        = Playing Range (A<sub>1</sub> B{{Music|b}}<sub>1</sub> E<sub>5</sub> A{{Music|b}}<sub>5</sub>)\n|description  =\n|filename2    = Bassoon-technical-bflatoctaves.ogg\n|title2       = Tone across octaves (B{{Music|b}}<sub>1</sub> B{{Music|b}}<sub>2</sub> B{{Music|b}}<sub>3</sub> B{{Music|b}}<sub>4</sub>)\n|description2 =\n|filename3    = Bassoon-technical-chromatic.ogg\n|title3       = Chromatic scale (B{{Music|b}}<sub>1</sub> to B{{Music|b}}<sub>4</sub>)\n|description3 =\n|filename4    = Bassoon-technical-articulations.ogg\n|title4       = Articulations (staccato, legato, legato+vibrato, slurred)\n|description4 =\n|filename5    = Bassoon-technical-dynamics.ogg\n|title5       = Dynamics\n|description5 =\n|filename6    = Bassoon-technical-trills.ogg\n|title6       = Trills (B<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>5</sub> B<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>)\n|description6 =\n|filename7    = Bassoon-technical-mouthbend.ogg\n|title7       = Embouchure bending\n|description7 =\n|filename8    = Bassoon-technical-reed.ogg\n|title8       = Bassoon reed alone or ''crowing''\n|description8 =\n|filename9    = Bassoon-technical-fluttertongue.ogg\n|title9       = Flutter tonguing\n|description9 =\n}}\n[[File:Bassoon handrest behind.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of a hand rest attached to a bassoon, viewed from behind. See also: [[:File:Bassoon handrest front.jpg|viewed from the front]].]]\nThe bassoon is held diagonally in front of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily supported by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached to the base of the boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a ''balance hanger'' is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.\n\nThe bassoon is played with both hands in a stationary position, the left above the right, with five main finger holes on the front of the instrument (nearest the audience) plus a sixth that is activated by an open-standing key. Five additional keys on the front are controlled by the little fingers of each hand. The back of the instrument (nearest the player) has twelve or more keys to be controlled by the thumbs, the exact number varying depending on model.\n\nTo stabilize the right hand, many bassoonists use an adjustable comma-shaped apparatus called a \"crutch,\" or a hand rest, which mounts to the boot joint. The crutch is secured with a thumb screw, which also allows the distance that it protrudes from the bassoon to be adjusted. Players rest the curve of the right hand where the thumb joins the palm against the crutch. The crutch also keeps the right hand from tiring and enables the player to keep the finger pads flat on the finger holes and keys.\n\nAn aspect of bassoon technique not found on any other woodwind is called ''flicking''. It involves the left hand thumb momentarily pressing, or 'flicking' the high A, [[C (musical note)|C]] and [[D (musical note)|D]] keys at the beginning of certain notes in the middle octave to achieve a clean slur from a lower note. This eliminates cracking, or brief [[multiphonics]] that happens without the use of this technique. Flicking is not done by 100% of bassoonists, some omit it or vent instead (see below).\n\nThe alternative method is \"venting\", which requires that the register key be used as part of the full fingering as opposed to being open momentarily at the start of the note. This is sometimes called the \"European Style.\"\n\nWhile flicking is used to slur up to higher notes, the whisper key is used for lower notes. From the A{{music|b}} right below middle C and lower, the whisper key is pressed with the left thumb and held for the duration of the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using the whisper key is especially important to ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.\n\nWhile bassoons are usually critically tuned at the factory, the player nonetheless has a great degree of flexibility of pitch control through the use of breath support, [[embouchure]], and reed profile. Players can also use alternate fingerings to adjust the pitch of many notes. Similar to other woodwind instruments, the length of the bassoon can be increased to lower pitch or decreased to raise pitch. On the bassoon, this is done preferably by changing the bocal to one of a different length, (lengths are denoted by a number on the bocal, usually starting at 0 for the shortest length, and 3 for the longest, but there are some manufacturers who will use other numbers) but it is possible to push the bocal in or out to adjust the pitch.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bluemountainensemble.org/page3/assets/Burns-Bn_Intonation_Issues.pdf |title=Bassoon Intonation Issues |access-date=5 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730022117/http://bluemountainensemble.org/page3/assets/Burns-Bn_Intonation_Issues.pdf |archive-date=30 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<!--labeled keywork picture goes here-->\n\n===Embouchure===\nThe bassoon embouchure is a very important aspect of producing a full, round, and dark bassoon tone. The bassoon embouchure is made by opening one's mouth, rolling lips inward to cover the teeth, and then dropping the jaw down as in a yawning motion (without actually yawning or opening the mouth). Both upper and lower teeth should be covered by the lips in order to protect the reed and control applied pressure. The reed is then placed in the mouth, with the lips and facial muscles maintaining an airtight seal around the reed. The upper lip will be farther forward on the reed than the lower lip, as in an \"overbite\" of the upper jaw. As with other orchestral double reeds, embouchure must be adjusted constantly for good intonation; this is achieved mainly by adjustment of lower jaw pressure.\n\n===Modern fingering===\n[[File:Standard Bassoon Fingering Keys Diagram.png|thumb|right|480px|Diagram describing the keys on a bassoon.]]\nThe left thumb alone operates nine keys: B{{Music|b}}<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> (also B<sub>4</sub>), two keys when combined create A<sub>4</sub>, and the whisper key. The whisper key should be held down for notes between and including F<sub>1</sub> and G{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub> and certain other notes. Additional notes can be created with the left thumb keys. The D<sub>1</sub> and bottom key above the whisper key on the tenor joint (C{{music|#}} key) together create both C{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub> and C{{music|#}}<sub>3</sub>. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering, to create E<sub>4</sub> and F<sub>4</sub>. D<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> together create C{{music|#}}<sub>4</sub>. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A<sub>4</sub> are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub> is created. The whisper key may also be used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound.\n\nThe right thumb operates four keys. The uppermost key is used to produce B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> and B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>, and is used in B<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, and E{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>. The large circular key, otherwise known as the \"pancake key\", is held down for all the lowest notes from E<sub>1</sub> down to B{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in [[Ravel]]'s \"[[Bol\u00e9ro]]\", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G<sub>4</sub>. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G<sub>4</sub>, but Ravel directs that the player should also depress the E<sub>1</sub> key (pancake key) to mute the sound. The next key operated by the right thumb is known as the \"spatula key\": its primary use is to produce F{{music|#}}<sub>1</sub> and F{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub>. The lowermost key is used less often: it is used to produce A{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> (G{{music|#}}<sub>1</sub>) and A{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> (G{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub>), when the tone may be improved by combining this with the backmost key E{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> of the right hand little finger: this is most advantageous in pieces like [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]]'s \"[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]\".\n\nThe four fingers of the left hand can each be used in at least two different positions, three in the case of the index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E<sub>4</sub>. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub> and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a [[Polisi Artist]] bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C{{music|#}}<sub>1</sub>. The upper key is used for E{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, F{{music|#}}<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>, B<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, C{{music|#}}<sub>4</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub>.\n\nThe four fingers of the right hand have at least one assignment each. The index finger stays over one hole, except that when E{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub> is played a side key at the top of the boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it, and this ring and other pads are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hand pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used, typically for B{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> and B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>, in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F<sub>1</sub> is played. F{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub> is created with this key, as well as G<sub>4</sub>, B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>, B<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>4</sub>. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub> (G{{music|#}}<sub>1</sub>) and A{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> (G{{music|#}}<sub>2</sub>) but can be used E{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>, and F<sub>4</sub>. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A{{music|b}}<sub>2</sub> and A{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>.\n\n===Extended techniques===\nMany extended techniques can be performed on the bassoon, such as [[multiphonic]]s, [[flutter-tonguing]], [[circular breathing]], [[tonguing|double tonguing]], and harmonics. In the case of the bassoon, flutter-tonguing may be accomplished by \"gargling\" in the back of the throat as well as by the conventional method of rolling Rs. Multiphonics on the bassoon can be achieved by using particular alternative fingerings.\n\nAlso, using certain fingerings, notes may be produced on the instrument that sound lower pitches than the actual range of the instrument. These \"impossible notes\" tend to sound very gravelly and out of tune, but technically sound below the low B{{Music|b}}. Alternatively, lower notes can be produced by inserting a small paper or rubber tube into the end of the bell, which converts the lower B{{Music|b}} into a lower note such as an A natural; this lowers the pitch of the instrument, but has the positive effect of bringing the lowest register (which is typically quite sharp) into tune. A notable piece that calls for the use of a low A bell is [[Carl Nielsen]]'s [[Wind Quintet (Nielsen)|Wind Quintet]], op. 43, which includes an optional low A for the final cadence of the work. Bassoonists sometimes use the end bell segment of an English horn or clarinet if one is available instead of a specially made extension. This often yields unsatisfactory results, though, as the resultant A can be quite sharp. The idea of using low A was begun by [[Richard Wagner]], who wanted to extend the range of the bassoon. Many passages in his later operas require the low A as well as the B-flat above. (This is impossible on a normal bassoon using an A extension as the fingering for the B-flat yields the low A.) These passages are typically realized on the contrabassoon, as recommended by the composer. Some bassoons have been made to allow bassoonists to realize similar passages. These bassoons are made with a \"Wagner bell\" which is an extended bell with a key for both the low A and the low B-flat. Bassoons with Wagner bells suffer similar intonational deficiencies as a bassoon with an A extension. Another composer who has required the bassoon to be [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] down to low A is [[Gustav Mahler]]. [[Richard Strauss]] also calls for the low A in his opera ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]''.\n\n===Learning the bassoon===\nThe complicated fingering and the problem of reeds make the bassoon more of a challenge to learn than some of the other woodwind instruments.<ref>Benjamin Kohon (Solo Bassoon of New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090114061229/http://www.idrs.org/Publications/DR/DR4.2/few.html A FEW NOTES ON THE BASSOON]. Reprinted from \"The Metronome,\" Vol. XLVIII, No. 7, July, 1932, p. 12.</ref> Cost is another big factor in a person's decision to pursue the bassoon. Prices range from $3,000 to over $20,000 for a good-quality instrument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://banddirector.com/woodwinds/double-reeds/buying-a-bassoon-for-a-student/|title=Buying a Bassoon for a Student|publisher=Band Director Media Group|access-date=24 January 2018|language=en-us}}</ref> In North America, schoolchildren typically take up bassoon only after starting on another reed instrument, such as clarinet or saxophone.<ref>Elsa Z. Powell (1950) ''This is an Orchestra'' Houghton Mifflin, page 70</ref>\n\nStudents in America often begin to pursue the study of bassoon performance and technique in the middle years of their music education. Students are often provided with a school instrument and encouraged to pursue lessons with private instructors. Students typically receive instruction in proper posture, hand position, embouchure, tone production, and reed making.\n\n==Reeds and reed construction==\n\n===Modern reeds===\n[[File:Bassoon-reeds2.jpg|thumb|[[Reed (instrument)|Bassoon reeds]] are usually around {{convert|5.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length and wrapped in thread.]]\n[[File:Bassoon reed binding.jpg|thumb|Detail of binding around base of reed.]]\nBassoon reeds, made of ''[[Arundo donax]]'' cane, are often made by the players themselves, although beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and ''gouged'' to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or ''profiled'', by removing material from the bark side. This can be done by hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel [[mandrel]] (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the \"throat,\" and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.\n\nAfter the reed has dried, the wires are tightened around the reed, which has shrunk after drying, or replaced completely. The lower part is sealed (a [[nitrocellulose]]-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks out through the bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). Electrical tape can also be used as a wrapping for amateur reed makers. The bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the \"Turk's head\"\u2014it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.\nRecently, more players are choosing the more modern heat-shrink tubing instead of the time-consuming and fiddly thread.\n\nTo finish the reed, the end of the reed blank, originally at the center of the unfolded piece of cane, is cut off, creating an opening. The blades above the first wire are now roughly {{convert|27|-|30|mm|abbr=on}} long. For the reed to play, a slight bevel must be created at the tip with a knife, although there is also a machine that can perform this function. Other adjustments with the reed knife may be necessary, depending on the hardness, the profile of the cane, and the requirements of the player. The reed opening may also need to be adjusted by squeezing either the first or second wire with the pliers. Additional material may be removed from the sides (the \"channels\") or tip to balance the reed. Additionally, if the \"e\" in the bass clef staff is sagging in pitch, it may be necessary to \"clip\" the reed by removing {{convert|1|-|2|mm|abbr=on}} from its length using a pair of very sharp scissors or the equivalent.<ref>Popkin and Glickman, 2007</ref><ref>McKay, 2001</ref>\n\nPlaying styles of individual bassoonists vary greatly; because of this, most advanced players will make their own reeds, in the process customizing them to their individual playing requirements. Many companies and individuals do offer reeds for sale, but even with store-bought reeds, players must know how to make adjustments to suit their particular playing style.\n\nThe tools used for adjusting reeds are very similar to those used to make the reeds themselves.\n\n===Early reeds===\nLittle is known about the early construction of the bassoon reed, as few examples survive, and much of what is known is only what can be gathered from artistic representations. The earliest known written instructions date from the middle of the 17th century, describing the reed as being held together by wire or resined thread; the earliest actual reeds that survive are more than a century younger, a collection of 21 reeds from the late 18th-century Spanish ''bajon''.\n\n==Notable bassoon repertoire==\n{{Main article|Bassoon concerto|Bassoon sonata}}\n\n===Baroque===\n[[File:Fagotter.JPG|thumb|A collection of historical bassoons, from early baroque to modern, including a classical [[contrabassoon]].]]\n{{listen\n|filename=Mozart - Bassoon Concerto in Bb major - Allegro.ogg\n|title=Bassoon Concerto\n|description=First movement of [[Bassoon Concerto (Mozart)|Mozart's Bassoon Concerto]]\n|filename2     = Bassoon_beethoven.ogg\n|title2        = Excerpt from the first movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony\n|description2  = Bassoon performance from [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 4th Symphony]]\n|filename3=Julius Weissenborn - Six Trios for 3 Bassoons Op. 4 - 4.

An [[animal]] or [[machine]] that usually moves in a '''bipedal''' manner is known as a '''biped''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|a\u026a|p|\u025b|d}}, meaning \"two feet\" (from the [[Latin]] ''bis'' for \"double\" and ''pes'' for \"foot\"). Types of bipedal movement include [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping|hopping]].\n\nFew modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within [[mammal]]s, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, [[Dipodomyinae|kangaroo rats and mice]], [[springhare]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heglund | first1 = NC | last2 = Cavagna | first2 = GA | last3 = Taylor | first3 = CR | year = 1982 | title = Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion.

In the [[Triassic]] period some groups of [[archosaur]]s (a group that includes the  ancestors of [[crocodile]]s) developed bipedalism; among their descendants the [[dinosaur]]s, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the [[bird]]s descended from one group of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.\n\nA larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several [[lizard]] species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as [[gibbon]]s and [[Indriidae|indriids]], exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''bi(s)'' 'two' and ''ped-'' 'foot', as contrasted with [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] 'four feet'.\n\n==Advantages==\nLimited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages.  Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths.  While upright, non-locomotory [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus).  The maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone \u2013 both the [[ostrich]] and the [[red kangaroo]] can reach speeds of {{convert|70|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[cheetah]] can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Garland_1983_JZL\">{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T.

Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut \u2014 for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as [[Uner Tan syndrome]] \u2014 very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior.<ref name=\"HumphreyEtAl2005HumanHandWalkers\">{{cite web | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | title=Human Hand-Walkers: Five Siblings Who Never Stood Up | author1=Humphrey, N. | author2=Skoyles, J.R. | author3=Keynes, R. | publisher=Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics | year=2005 | format=PDF | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910205939/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | archivedate=2008-09-10 | df= }}</ref> Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that \"normal\" humans can crawl on hands and knees. This article therefore avoids the terms \"facultative\" and \"obligate\", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion ''normally'' used by various groups of animals. Normal humans may be considered \"obligate\" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible.\n\n==Movement==\nThere are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism.\n\n# [[Standing]]. Staying still on both legs. In most bipeds this is an active process, requiring constant adjustment of balance.\n# [[Walking]]. One foot in front of another, with at least one foot on the ground at any time.\n# [[Running]]. One foot in front of another, with periods where both feet are off the ground.\n# [[Jumping]]/hopping. Moving by a series of jumps with both feet moving together.\n\n==Bipedal animals==\nThe great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds, with bipedalism exhibited by only a handful of living groups. Humans, [[gibbon|gibbons]] and large birds [[walking|walk]] by raising one foot at a time.  On the other hand, most macropods, smaller birds, lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. [[Tree kangaroo]]s are able to walk or hop, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.\n\n===Amphibians===\nThere are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.\n\n===Extant reptiles===\nMany species of [[lizards]] become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus ''[[Ctenosaura]]'').\n\n====Early reptiles and lizards====\nThe first known biped is the [[bolosaurid]] ''[[Eudibamus]]'' whose fossils date from 290 million years ago.<ref>{{cite news | title = Upright lizard leaves dinosaur standing | date=  2000-11-03 | work = cnn.com | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031005956/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal | author=Berman, David S. | title=Early Permian Bipedal Reptile | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | year=2000 | volume=290 | issue=5493 | pages=969\u2013972 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/290/5493/969 | doi=10.1126/science.290.5493.969 | pmid=11062126 | bibcode=2000Sci...290..969B | display-authors=etal | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930230048/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/290/5493/969 | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}</ref> Its long hindlegs, short forelegs, and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism.

The theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees. This theory is closely related to the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna, as  evidenced by morphological characteristics found in ''Australopithecus anamensis'' and ''Australopithecus afarensis'' forelimbs, and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera Pan and Gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for Pan and Gorilla before losing it in Australopithecus.<ref>Richmond, B. G., and D. S. Strait. 2000. Evidence that humans evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor.

The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Green, Alemseged|first1=David, Zeresenay|title=Australopithecus afarensis Scapular Ontogeny, Function, and the Role of Climbing in Human Evolution|journal=Science|date=2017|volume=338|issue=6106|pages=514\u2013517}}</ref> It is possible that Bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait.

The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.<ref>Shreeve, James, [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc \"Sunset on the savanna\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928010036/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc |date=2017-09-28 }}, \u2018\u2019Discover'', 1996</ref>\n\nSome of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life. For example, [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], the famous ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', found in Hadar in Ethiopia, which may have been forested at the time of Lucy\u2019s death, had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches, but she walked bipedally. \u201c[[Little Foot]],\u201d a nearly-complete specimen of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright. \u201cLittle Foot\u201d could grasp things using his feet like an ape, perhaps tree branches, and he was bipedal. Ancient pollen found in the soil in the locations in which these fossils were found suggest that the area used to be much more wet and covered in thick vegetation and has only recently become the arid desert it is now.<ref name=\"Sunset on the savanna\"/>\n\n===Traveling efficiency hypothesis===\nAn alternative explanation is the mixture of savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees, and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Isbell, L.A.  |author2=T.P.

While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with [[chimpanzee]] arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the ''[[Australopithecus]]'' hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to [[humans]]. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288349918_The_postural_feeding_hypothesis_An_ecological_model_for_the_evolution_of_bipedalism)\n\nA similar study conducted by Thorpe et al. looked at how the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, held onto supporting branches in order to navigate branches that were too flexible or unstable otherwise.  They found that in more than 75% of locomotive instances the orangutans used their hands to stabilize themselves while they navigated thinner branches.   They hypothesized that increased fragmentation of forests where A. afarensis as well as other ancestors of modern humans and other apes resided  could have contributed to this increase of bipedalism in order to navigate the diminishing forests.  Their findings also shed light on a couple of discrepancies observed in the anatomy of A. afarensis, such as the ankle joint, which allowed it to \u201cwobble\u201d and long, highly flexible forelimbs.  The idea that bipedalism started from walking in trees explains both the increased flexibility in the ankle as well as the long limbs which would be used to grab hold of branches.\n\n===Provisioning model===\nOne theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by [[Owen Lovejoy (anthropologist)|C. Owen Lovejoy]], known as \"male provisioning\".<ref name=\"Price\">{{cite book\n|author1=T. Douglas Price |author2=Gary M.

In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early [[hominids]] engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring survivorship and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction (\"feminization\") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunet|first=Michel|author2=Guy F|author3=Pilbeam D|author4=Mackaye HT|author5=Likius A|title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa|journal=Nature|date=11 July 2002|volume=418|pages=145\u2013151|doi=10.1038/nature00879|pmid=12110880|url=http://www.nature.com/nature|issue=6894|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724115656/http://www.nature.com/nature|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=}}</ref> and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suwa|first=Gen|author2=Kono RT |author3=Simpson SW |author4=Asfaw B |author5=Lovejoy CO |author6=White TD |title=Paleobiological implications of the ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' dentition|journal=Science|date=2 October 2009|volume=326|pages=94\u201399|doi=10.1126/science.1175824|pmid=19810195|url=|issue=5949|bibcode = 2009Sci...326...94S }}</ref> which along with low body size dimorphism in ''Ardipithecus''<ref>White TD et al.

Science. 2009 326(5949):74e1-8.</ref> In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of [[sexual swelling]]) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nHowever, this model has generated some controversy, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is [[sexual dimorphism]] is minimal, and other studies have suggested that [[Australopithecus afarensis]] males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk.<ref>Lovejoy CO. Science. 1981 211(4480):341-50.</ref> Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom<ref>Keith Oatley, Dacher Keltner, Jennifer M. Jenkins. Understanding Emotion (2006) Second Edition. Page 235.</ref> and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as [[gibbon]]s tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that ''Australopithecus afarensis'' lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate.\n\n===Early bipedalism in homininae model===\nRecent studies of 4.4 million years old  ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' suggest bipedalism, it is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in [[homininae]] and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. According to Richard Dawkins in his book \"[[The Ancestor's Tale]]\",  chimps and bonobos are descended from ''[[Australopithecus]]'' gracile type species while gorillas are descended from [[Paranthropus]]. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins. Early [[homininae]]s such as ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19667206 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901280106 | pmc=2732797 | volume=106 | issue=34 | title=Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor |date=August 2009 | journal=Proc.

It is also proposed that one cause of [[Neanderthal extinction]] was a less efficient running.\n\n===Warning display (aposematic) model===\n[[Joseph Jordania]] from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on [[aposematism]], or [[warning display]] and [[intimidation]] of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal:  upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head, [[body painting]], threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania]]. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011</ref> Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators.\n\n===Other behavioural models===\nThere are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (''e.g.'' Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (''e.g.'' 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (''e.g.'' Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive, as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture.<ref name=\"Dean, F 2000\"/>\n\n===Thermoregulatory model===\nThe thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = P.E. | year = 1984 | title = The evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids | url = | journal = J.

During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of [[Ardipithecus]] reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the [[forest]] and [[woodland]] environmental [[preadaptation]] of early-stage [[hominid]] bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of [[natural selection]]. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions [[ecological niche]], rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus. A feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David-Barrett | first1 = T. | last2 = Dunbar | first2 = R. | year = 2016 | title = Bipedality and hair loss in human evolution revisited: The impact of altitude and activity scheduling | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.006 | journal = J.

Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon Hewes (1961) suggested that the carrying of meat \"over considerable distances\" (Hewes 1961:689) was the key factor. Isaac (1978) and Sinclair et al. (1986) offered modifications of this idea, as indeed did Lovejoy (1981) with his \"provisioning model\" described above. Others, such as Nancy Tanner (1981), have suggested that infant carrying was key, while others again have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change.<ref>Tanner, Nancy Makepeace [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1425592 \"On Becoming Human\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522084709/http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1425592 |date=2013-05-22 }} Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981</ref> This stone-tools theory is very unlikely, as though ancient humans were known to hunt, the discovery of tools was not discovered for thousands of years after the origin of bipedalism, chronologically precluding it from being a driving force of evolution. (Wooden tools and spears fossilize poorly and therefore it is difficult to make a judgment about their potential usage.)\n\n===Wading models===\nThe observation that large primates, including especially the great apes, that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land, tend to switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water, has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments.  This idea, labelled \"the wading hypothesis\",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuliukas A |title=Wading Hypotheses of the Origin of Human Bipedalism |journal=Human Evolution |volume=28 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=213\u2013236 |date=2013}}</ref> was originally suggested by the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] [[marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] who said: \"It seems to me likely that Man learnt to stand erect first in water and then, as his balance improved, he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when he came out, and indeed also for running.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hardy|first= Alister C. | year=1960 | title=Was man more aquatic in the past? | journal=[[New Scientist]] | volume=7 | issue=174| authorlink=Alister Hardy | pages=642\u2013645 | url=http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Hardy/Hardy1960.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326175059/http://www.riverapes.com/AAH/Hardy/Hardy1960.pdf | archivedate=26 March 2009 | format=PDF |ref=harv}}</ref> It was then promoted by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], as part of the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], who cited bipedalism among a cluster of other human traits unique among primates, including voluntary control of breathing, hairlessness and subcutaneous fat.<ref name = Morgan1997>{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Elaine | authorlink = Elaine Morgan (writer) | title = The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis   | year = 1997 | publisher = Souvenir Press | isbn = 0-285-63518-2  }}</ref>  The \"[[aquatic ape hypothesis]]\", as originally formulated, has not been accepted or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community.<ref name = Meier>{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?doi=r_Wit4KYSmMC&pg=PA57 57\u201359]}}</ref> Others, however, have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further (\"aquatic ape\" related) factors.

It has also been thought that consistent water-based food sources had developed early hominid dependency and facilitated dispersal along seas and rivers.<ref>{Verhaegena, M., P. F. Puechb, S. Munro. 2002. Aquaboreal ancestors? Trends in Evolution and Ecology: 212 \u2013 217.}</ref>\n\n=== Consequences ===\nDuring the hominin\u2019s early evolution, brains became larger, due to increased intelligence, and bipedalism became the norm. The consequences of these two changes in particular resulted in painful and difficult labor due to the increased favor of a narrow pelvis for bipedalism being countered by larger heads passing through the constricted birth canal. This phenomenon is commonly known as the [[obstetrical dilemma]].\n\n==Physiology==\nBipedal movement occurs in a number of ways, and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below.\n\n===Biomechanics===\n\n====Standing====\nEnergy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid [[feedback|overcorrection]].  The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness.\n\n====Shoulder stability====\nShoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism.  Shoulder mobility would increase because the need for a stable shoulder is only present in arboreal habitats. Shoulder mobility would support suspensory locomotion behaviors which are present in human bipedalism. The forelimbs are freed from weight-bearing requirements, which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Sylvester | first1 = Adam D | year = 2006\n | title = Locomotor Coupling and the Origin of Hominin Bipedalism\n | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 242 | issue = | pages = 581\u2013590\n | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.04.016\n}}\n</ref>\n\n====Walking====\nWalking is characterized by an \"inverted pendulum\" movement in which the [[center of gravity]] vaults over a stiff leg with each step.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1sz5501URh0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=macmahon+muscles#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Muscles, reflexes, and locomotion | isbn = 978-0-691-02376-2 | author1 = McMahon | first1 = Thomas A | year = 1984}}</ref>  [[Force plate]]s can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  This model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = A moving topic: control and dynamics of animal locomotion | isbn = 978-0-19-850022-3 | author1 = Biewener | first1 = Andrew A | year = 2003 | pmid = 20410030 | last2 = Daniel | first2 = T | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 387\u20138 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0294 | pmc = 2880073 | journal = Biology Letters}}</ref>\n\nIn humans, walking is composed of several separate processes:<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n* Vaulting over a stiff stance leg\n* Passive ballistic movement of the swing leg\n* A short 'push' from the ankle prior to toe-off, propelling the swing leg\n* Rotation of the hips about the axis of the spine, to increase stride length\n* Rotation of the hips about the horizontal axis to improve balance during stance\n\n====Running====\nRunning is characterized by a spring-mass movement.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>  Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Musculature===\nBipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in [[domestication|domesticated]] [[poultry]] the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]] muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than the well-developed biceps of the arms.\n\n===Respiration===\nA biped has the ability to breathe while running, without strong coupling to stride cycle. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] system is functioning. During a sprint the anaerobic system kicks in and breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint.\n\n==Bipedal robots==\n{{Main|Humanoid robot|Chicken walker}}\n[[Image:Asimo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[ASIMO]] - a bipedal robot]]\nFor nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal [[robot]]s were very difficult to construct and [[robot locomotion]] involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs.

The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage.  It is in this sense that the computer \"pulls itself up by its bootstraps\", ''i.e.'' it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to [[firmware]] and software which is loaded into [[main memory]]. Booting often involves processes such as performing [[power-on self-test|self-tests]], loading [[computer configuration|configuration]] settings, loading a [[BIOS]], [[resident monitor]]s, a [[hypervisor]], an [[operating system]], or [[utility software]].\n\nThe computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a [[hardwired control|hardwired program]] to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.<ref>{{Cite journal | year = 1953 | title = The System Design of the IBM Type 701 Computer | author = Buchholz, Werner | journal = Proceedings of the I.R.E. | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | page = 1273 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1953.274300}}</ref>\n\n====Software development====\nBootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor (''e.g.'', [[ed (UNIX)|ed]]) and an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[integrated development environment|IDE]] and an extremely [[high-level programming language]].\n\nHistorically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a [[cross compiler]] executed by a pre-existing computer.  Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no [[compiler]], no assembler, and no [[Linker (computing)|linker]]. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the [[IBM 650]]) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined [[assembly language]] but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established.  This was how the early assembly program SOAP ([[Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program]]) was developed.  Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.\n\nThe term was also championed by [[Doug Engelbart]] to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His [[SRI International|SRI]] team that developed the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.\n\n====Compilers====\n{{main article | Bootstrapping (compilers)}}\nThe development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion. Using an existing language to bootstrap a new language is one way to solve the \"[[chicken or the egg]]\" causality dilemma.\n\n====Installers====\n{{main article | Installation (computer programs)}}\nDuring the installation of computer programs it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file (''e.g.'' [[setup.exe]]) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.\n\n====Overlay networks====\n{{main article|Bootstrapping node}}\n\nA bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host,<ref name=\"Francis01\">{{cite journal |title=Yoid: Extending the Internet Multicast Architecture |publisher=www.aciri.org |author=Francis, Paul |date=2000-04-02 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/francis/yoidArch.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24}}</ref> is a [[Node (networking)|node]] in an [[overlay network]] that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.<ref name=\"sun01\">{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=6cF3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 7,065,579 |accessdate=2008-12-23 |author=Traversat |date=2006-06-20 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"Saxena01\">{{cite journal |title=Admission Control in Peer-to-Peer: Design and Performance Evaluation |publisher=In ACM Workshop on Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN) 2003 |author=Saxena |year=2003 |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/paps/sty03.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n====Discrete event simulation====\n{{main article | Discrete event simulation}}\nA type of [[computer simulation]] called [[discrete event simulation]] represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events.

No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research.\n\nSeed AI is a significant part of some theories about the [[technological singularity]]: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cortese|first=Francesco Albert Bosco|date=Spring 2014|title=The Maximally Distributed Intelligence Explosion|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS14/paper/viewFile/7763/7739|journal=AAAI Spring Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waser|first=Mark R.|date=2014|title=Bootstrapping a Structured Self-Improving & Safe Autopoietic Self|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877050914015403/1-s2.0-S1877050914015403-main.pdf?_tid=eba4f73c-b275-435a-aa44-363f7e8c83bb&acdnat=1530480295_5671d8d4b0fcd9317c8900ff77997992|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=Volume 41|pages=134-139|via=Elsevier}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n{{main article | Bootstrapping (statistics) | Bootstrapping populations}}\nBootstrapping is a [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] technique used to obtain estimates of summary statistics.\n\n===Business===\n[[Bootstrapping (business)|Bootstrapping in business]] means starting a business without external help or capital.

Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.\n\nTherefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A [[black start]] is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.\n\n===Cellular networks===\n{{main article | Bootstrapping Server Function | Generic Bootstrapping Architecture }}\nA Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in [[cellular network]]s which provides application independent functions for mutual [[authentication]] of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.\n\n===Media===\n{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2015|small = yes}}\n\nA media bootstrap is the process whereby a story or meme is deliberately (but artificially) produced by self and peer-referential journalism, originally within a tight circle of media content originators, often commencing with stories written within the same media organization. This story is then expanded into a general media \"accepted wisdom\" with the aim of having it accepted as self-evident \"common knowledge\" by the reading, listening and viewing publics. The key feature of a media bootstrap is that as little hard, verifiable, external evidence as possible is used to support the story, preference being given to the citation (often unattributed) of other media stories, ''i.e.'' \"journalists interviewing journalists\".\n\nBecause the campaign is usually originated and at least initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, the campaign is said to have \"pulled itself up by its own bootstraps\".\n\nA bootstrap campaign should be distinguished from a genuine news story of genuine interest, such as a natural disaster that kills thousands, or the death of a respected public figure. It is legitimate for these stories to be given coverage across all media platforms. What distinguishes a bootstrap from a real story is the contrived and organized manner in which the bootstrap appears to come out of nowhere. A bootstrap commonly claims to be tapping a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon within society.\n\nAs self-[[levitating]] by pulling on one's bootstraps is physically impossible, this is often used by the bootstrappers themselves to deny the possibility that the bootstrap campaign is indeed concocted and artificial. They assert that it has arisen via a groundswell of public opinion. Media campaigns that are openly admitted as concocted (''e.g.'' a public service campaign titled \"Let's Clean Up Our City\") are usually ignored by other media organizations for reasons related to competition. On the other hand, the true bootstrap welcomes the participation of other media organizations, indeed encourages it, as this participation gains the bootstrap notoriety and, most importantly, legitimacy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bootstrap paradox]]\n* [[Conceptual metaphor]]\n* [[Horatio Alger myth]]\n* [[M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma]]\n* [[Positive feedback]]\n* [[Robert A.

Lithuanian was first attested in a [[hymnal]] translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a [[Catechism]] by [[Martynas Ma\u017evydas]] was published in 1547 in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], Prussia (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585.\n\nOne reason {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples [[Northern Crusades|resisted Christianization]] longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.\n\nWith the establishment of a [[History of Germany|German]] state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.\n\nDuring the years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569\u20131795), official documents were written in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Latin]].\n\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Commonwealth]], most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a [[Russification]] effort (see [[Lithuanian press ban]] for the ban in force from 1865 to 1904).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Baltic languages.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the Baltic languages in the Baltic (simplified)]]\nSpeakers of modern Baltic languages are generally concentrated within the borders of [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], and in emigrant communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the countries within the former borders of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nHistorically the languages were spoken over a larger area: west to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river in present-day [[Poland]], at least as far east as the [[Dniepr]] river in present-day [[Belarus]], perhaps even to [[Moscow]], and perhaps as far south as [[Kiev]]. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in [[hydronym]]s (names of bodies of water) that are characteristically Baltic. The use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of a culture's influence, but ''not'' the date of such influence.\n\nThe [[Mordvinic languages]], spoken mainly along western tributaries of the [[Volga]], show several dozen loanwords from one or more Baltic languages. These may have been mediated by contacts with the Eastern Balts along the river [[Oka River|Oka]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Riho|last=Gr\u00fcnthal|chapter=Baltic loanwords in Mordvin|title=A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe|date=2012|pages=297\u2013343|chapter-url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_grunthal.pdf|series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia 266}}</ref>\n\nThe eventual expansion of the use of [[Slavic languages]] in the south and east, and [[Germanic languages]] in the west, reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered. The Russian geneticist Oleg Balanovsky speculated that there is a predominance of the assimilated pre-Slavic substrate in the genetics of East and West Slavic populations, according to him the common genetic structure which contrasts East Slavs and Balts from other populations may suggest that the pre-Slavic substrate of the [[East Slavs]] consists most significantly of Baltic-speakers, which predated the Slavs in the cultures of the [[Eurasian steppe]] according to archaeological references he cites.<ref>{{cite web |last1=\u041f

extinct Baltic languages have a limited or nonexistent written record, their existence being known only from the records of ancient historians and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.\n\nThe Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] family by most scholars. This family is considered to have developed from a common ancestor, [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]]. Later on, several lexical, phonological and morphological dialectisms developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other.<ref name=\"Mallory1991\">{{cite book |author=J. P.

Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it. In the 1960s [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages: a) Proto-Slavic language formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; b) Slavic linguistic type formed later from the Baltic languages structural model; c) the Slavic structural model is a result of the Baltic languages structural model transformation. These scholars\u2019 theses do not contradict the Baltic and Slavic languages closeness and from a historical perspective specify the Baltic-Slavic languages evolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dini |first=P.U. |title=Balt\u0173 kalbos.

As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for ''[[in silico]]'' analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.\n\nBioinformatics is both an [[umbrella term]] for the body of biological studies that use [[computer programming]] as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of [[genomics]]. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates [[gene]]s and single [[nucleotide]] polymorphisms ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within [[nucleic acid]] and [[protein]] sequences, called [[proteomics]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lesk |first=A.

In experimental [[molecular biology]], bioinformatics techniques such as [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]] allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed [[mutation]]s. It plays a role in the [[text mining]] of biological literature and the development of biological and gene [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of [[systems biology]]. In [[structural biology]], it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Sim |first=A. Y.

For example, there are methods to locate a [[gene]] within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to [[Cluster analysis|cluster]] protein sequences into families of related sequences.\n\nThe primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include: [[pattern recognition]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] algorithms, and [[Biological Data Visualization|visualization]]. Major research efforts in the field include [[sequence alignment]], [[gene finding]], [[genome assembly]], [[drug design]], [[drug discovery]], [[protein structural alignment|protein structure alignment]], [[protein structure prediction]], prediction of [[gene expression]] and [[protein\u2013protein interactions]], [[genome-wide association studies]], the modeling of [[evolution]] and [[Cellular model|cell division/mitosis.]]\n\nBioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.\n\nOver the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.\n\nCommon activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing [[DNA]] and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.\n\n===Relation to other fields===\nBioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from [[biological computation]], while it is often considered synonymous to [[computational biology]]. Biological computation uses [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build biological [[computer]]s, whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the [[Human Genome Project]] and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.\n\nAnalyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use [[algorithm]]s from [[graph theory]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[soft computing]], [[data mining]], [[image processing]], and [[computer simulation]]. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as [[discrete mathematics]], [[control theory]], [[system theory]], [[information theory]], and [[statistics]].\n\n==Sequence analysis==\n{{main|Sequence alignment|Sequence database}}\n[[File:WPP domain alignment.PNG|500px|thumbnail|left|The sequences of different genes or proteins may be aligned side-by-side to measure their similarity.

This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode [[protein]]s, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a [[species]] or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of [[molecular systematics]] to construct [[phylogenetic tree]]s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today{{when|date=September 2018}}, [[computer program]]s such as [[BLAST]] are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion [[nucleotide]]s.<ref name=\"pmid18073190\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Benson DA, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ, Ostell J, Wheeler DL |title=GenBank |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D25\u201330 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18073190 |pmc=2238942 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm929 }}</ref> These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical.

[[DNA sequencing]] is still a non-trivial problem as the raw data may be noisy or afflicted by weak signals. [[Algorithm]]s have been developed for [[base calling]] for the various experimental approaches to DNA sequencing.\n\n===Sequence assembly===\n{{main|Sequence assembly}}\nMost DNA sequencing techniques produce short fragments of sequence that need to be assembled to obtain complete gene or genome sequences. The so-called [[shotgun sequencing]] technique (which was used, for example, by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) to sequence the first bacterial genome, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'')<ref name=\"pmid7542800\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496\u2013512 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7542800 |doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |bibcode=1995Sci...269..496F }}</ref> generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the [[human genome]], it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today{{when|date=September 2018}}, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.\n\n{{see also|sequence analysis|sequence mining|sequence profiling tool|sequence motif}}\n\n===Genome annotation===\n{{main|Gene prediction}}\n\nIn the context of [[genomics]], [[Genome project#Genome annotation|annotation]] is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. This process needs to be automated because most genomes are too large to annotate by hand, not to mention the desire to annotate as many genomes as possible, as the rate of [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] has ceased to pose a bottleneck. Annotation is made possible by the fact that genes have recognisable start and stop regions, although the exact sequence found in these regions can vary between genes.\n\nThe first description of a comprehensive genome annotation system was published in 1995 <ref name=\"pmid7542800\"/> by the team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] that performed the first complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<ref name=\"pmid7542800\"/> [[Owen White]] designed and built a software system to identify the genes encoding all proteins, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs (and other sites) and to make initial functional assignments. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the [[GeneMark]] program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', are constantly changing and improving.\n\nFollowing the goals that the Human Genome Project left to achieve after its closure in 2003, a new project developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute in the U.S appeared. The so-called [[ENCODE]] project is a collaborative data collection of the functional elements of the human genome that uses next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies and genomic tiling arrays, technologies able to automatically generate large amounts of data at a dramatically reduced per-base cost but with the same accuracy (base call error) and fidelity (assembly error).\n\n===Computational evolutionary biology===\n{{further|Computational phylogenetics}}\n\n[[Evolutionary biology]] is the study of the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time. [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:\n* trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their [[DNA]], rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,\n* more recently{{when|date=September 2018}}, compare entire [[genomes]], which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in bacterial [[speciation]],\n* build complex computational [[population genetics]] models to predict the outcome of the system over time<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carvajal-Rodr\u00edguez A |title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time |journal=Current Genomics |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=58\u201361 |year=2012 |pmid=20808525 |pmc=2851118 |doi=10.2174/138920210790218007 }}</ref>\n* track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms\nFuture work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex [[Evolutionary tree|tree of life]].\n\nThe area of research within [[computer science]] that uses [[genetic algorithm]]s is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.\n\n===Comparative genomics===\n{{main|Comparative genomics}}\n\nThe core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between [[genes]] ([[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=TA |title=Genomes |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |location=Manchester (UK) |edition=2nd |chapter=Mutation, Repair and Recombination}}</ref> Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and [[endosymbiosis]], often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, [[heuristics]], fixed parameter and [[approximation algorithms]] for problems based on parsimony models to [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms for [[Bayesian analysis]] of problems based on probabilistic models.\n\nMany of these studies are based on the detection of [[sequence homology]] to assign sequences to [[Protein family|protein families]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=N.

Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study.

Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown [[point mutation]]s in a variety of [[gene]]s in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of [[human genome]] sequences and [[germline]] polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as [[oligonucleotide]] microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), and [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] arrays to detect known ''point mutations''. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate [[terabyte]]s of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or [[noise]], and thus [[Hidden Markov model]] and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real [[copy number variation|copy number]] changes.\n\nTwo important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the [[exome]]. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vazquez|first=Miguel|last2=Torre|first2=Victor de la|last3=Valencia|first3=Alfonso|date=2012-12-27|title=Chapter 14: Cancer Genome Analysis|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1002824|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002824|pmid=23300415|pmc=3531315|issn=1553-7358|bibcode=2012PLSCB...8E2824V}}</ref>\n\nWith the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change.

All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate [[signal (information theory)|signal]] from [[noise]] in high-throughput gene expression studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grau|first1=J.|last2=Ben-Gal|first2=I.|last3=Posch|first3=S.|last4=Grosse|first4=I.|title=VOMBAT: prediction of transcription factor binding sites using variable order Bayesian trees|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 July 2006|volume=34|issue=Web Server|pages=W529\u2013W533|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl212 |pmid=16845064|pmc=1538886|url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/VOMBAT.pdf}}</ref> Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous [[epithelial]] cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.\n\n===Analysis of protein expression===\n[[Protein microarray]]s and high throughput (HT) [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected. Cellular protein localization in a tissue context can be achieved through affinity [[proteomics]] displayed as spatial data based on [[immunohistochemistry]] and [[tissue microarray]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proteinatlas.org |title=The Human Protein Atlas |website=www.proteinatlas.org |access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis of regulation===\n[[Regulation of gene expression|Regulation]] is the complex orchestration of events by which a signal, potentially an extracellular signal such as a [[hormone]], eventually leads to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more [[protein]]s. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.\n\nFor example, gene expression can be regulated by nearby elements in the genome. Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of [[sequence motif]]s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. [[Enhancer (genetics)|Enhancer]] elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression, through three-dimensional looping interactions. These interactions can be determined by bioinformatic analysis of [[chromosome conformation capture]] experiments.\n\nExpression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare [[microarray]] data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the [[cell cycle]], along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply [[cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]] to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented [[regulatory elements]]. Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are [[k-means clustering]], [[self-organizing map]]s (SOMs), [[hierarchical clustering]], and [[consensus clustering]] methods.\n\n==Analysis of cellular organization==\nSeveral approaches have been developed to analyze the location of organelles, genes, proteins, and other components within cells. This is relevant as the location of these components affects the events within a cell and thus helps us to predict the behavior of biological systems. A [[gene ontology]] category, ''cellular compartment'', has been devised to capture subcellular localization in many [[biological database]]s.\n\n===Microscopy and image analysis===\nMicroscopic pictures allow us to locate both [[organelle]]s as well as molecules. It may also help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells, e.g. in [[cancer]].\n\n===Protein localization===\nThe localization of proteins helps us to evaluate the role of a protein. For instance, if a protein is found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] it may be involved in [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] or [[RNA splicing|splicing]]. By contrast, if a protein is found in [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], it may be involved in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] or other [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]]. Protein localization is thus an important component of [[protein function prediction]]. There are well developed [[protein subcellular localization prediction]] resources available, including protein subcellualr location databases, and prediction tools.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humancell |title=The human cell |website=www.proteinatlas.org |access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thul |first=Peter J. |last2=\u00c5kesson |first2=Lovisa |last3=Wiking |first3=Mikaela |last4=Mahdessian |first4=Diana |last5=Geladaki |first5=Aikaterini |last6=Blal |first6=Hammou Ait |last7=Alm |first7=Tove |last8=Asplund |first8=Anna |last9=Bj\u00f6rk |first9=Lars |date=2017-05-26 |title=A subcellular map of the human proteome |journal=Science |volume=356 |issue=6340 |pages=eaal3321 |doi=10.1126/science.aal3321 |pmid=28495876}}</ref>\n\n===Nuclear organization of chromatin===\n{{main|Nuclear organization}}\nData from high-throughput [[chromosome conformation capture]] experiments, such as [[Hi-C (experiment)]] and [[ChIA-PET]], can provide information on the spatial proximity of DNA loci.

The [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, the so-called [[primary structure]], can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] \u2013 a.k.a. [[Mad Cow Disease]] \u2013 [[prion]].) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. Structural information is usually classified as one of ''[[secondary structure|secondary]]'', ''[[tertiary structure|tertiary]]'' and ''[[quaternary structure|quaternary]]'' structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOne of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of [[Sequence homology|homology]]. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ''A'', whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ''B,'' whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called [[homology modeling]], this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.\n\nOne example of this is hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes ([[leghemoglobin]]), which are distant relatives from the same [[protein superfamily]]. Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Although both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes and shared ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoy |first1=JA |last2=Robinson |first2=H |last3=Trent JT |first3=3rd |last4=Kakar |first4=S |last5=Smagghe |first5=BJ |last6=Hargrove |first6=MS |title=Plant hemoglobins: a molecular fossil record for the evolution of oxygen transport |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=3 August 2007 |volume=371 |issue=1 |pages=168\u201379 |pmid=17560601 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.029}}</ref>\n\nOther techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ''de novo'' (from scratch) physics-based modeling.\n\nAnother aspect of structural bioinformatics include the use of protein structures for [[Virtual screening|Virtual Screening]] models such as [[QSAR|Quantitative Structure-Aactivity Relationship]] models and proteochemometric models (PCM). Furthermore, a protein's crystal structure can be used in simulation of for example ligand-binding studies and ''In silico'' mutagenesis studies.\n\n==Network and systems biology==\n{{main|Computational systems biology|Biological network|Interactome}}\n\n''Network analysis'' seeks to understand the relationships within [[biological network]]s such as [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Interactome|protein\u2013protein interaction networks]]. Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.\n\n''Systems biology'' involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s that comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. [[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.\n\n===Molecular interaction networks===\n[[File:The protein interaction network of Treponema pallidum.png|200px|thumbnail|right|Interactions between proteins are frequently visualized and analyzed using networks. This network is made up of protein\u2013protein interactions from ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative agent of [[syphilis]] and other diseases.]]\n{{main|Protein\u2013protein interaction prediction|interactome}}\n\nTens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (protein NMR) and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein\u2013protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing [[protein\u2013protein interaction]] experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the [[protein\u2013protein docking]] problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.\n\nOther interactions encountered in the field include Protein\u2013ligand (including drug) and [[protein\u2013peptide]]. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational [[algorithm]]s, termed docking algorithms, for studying [[interactome|molecular interactions]].\n\n==Others==\n\n===Literature analysis===\n{{main|Text mining|Biomedical text mining}}\n\nThe growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:\n* Abbreviation recognition \u2013 identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms\n* Named entity recognition \u2013 recognizing biological terms such as gene names\n* Protein\u2013protein interaction \u2013 identify which [[protein]]s interact with which proteins from text\n\nThe area of research draws from [[statistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].\n\n===High-throughput image analysis===\nComputational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content [[medical imaging|biomedical imagery]]. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving [[accuracy]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both [[diagnostics]] and research. Some examples are:\n* high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization ([[high-content screening]], cytohistopathology, [[Bioimage informatics]])\n* [[morphometrics]]\n* clinical image analysis and visualization\n* determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals\n* quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury\n* making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals\n* infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination\n* inferring clone overlaps in [[Gene mapping|DNA mapping]], e.g. the [[Sulston score]]\n\n===High-throughput single cell data analysis===\n{{main|Flow cytometry bioinformatics}}\nComputational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from [[flow cytometry]]. These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.\n\n===Biodiversity informatics===\n{{main|Biodiversity informatics}}\nBiodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of [[biodiversity]] data, such as [[taxonomic database]]s, or [[microbiome]] data. Examples of such analyses include [[phylogenetics]], [[niche modelling]], [[species richness]] mapping, [[DNA barcoding]], or [[Speciesism|species]] identification tools.\n\n===Ontologies and data integration===\nBiological ontologies are directed acyclic graphs of controlled vocabularies. They are designed to capture biological concepts and descriptions in a way that can be easily categorised and analysed with computers. When categorised in this way, it is possible to gain added value from holistic and integrated analysis.\n\nThe [[OBO Foundry]] was an effort to standardise certain ontologies. One of the most widespread is the [[Gene ontology]] which  describes gene function. There are also ontologies which describe phenotypes.\n\n==Databases==\n{{main|List of biological databases|Biological database}}\nDatabases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. Many databases exist, covering various information types: for example, DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases may contain empirical data (obtained directly from experiments), predicted data (obtained from analysis), or, most commonly, both. They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. These databases vary in their format, access mechanism, and whether they are public or not.\n\nSome of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.\n\n* Used in biological sequence analysis: [[Genbank]], [[UniProt]]\n* Used in structure analysis: [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB)\n* Used in finding Protein Families and [[Sequence motif|Motif]] Finding: [[InterPro]], [[Pfam]]\n* Used for Next Generation Sequencing: [[Sequence Read Archive]]\n* Used in Network Analysis: Metabolic Pathway Databases ([[KEGG]], [[BioCyc database collection|BioCyc]]), Interaction Analysis Databases, Functional Networks\n* Used in design of synthetic genetic circuits: [[GenoCAD]]\n\n==Software and tools==\n[[List of bioinformatics software|Software tools for bioinformatics]] range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various [[List of bioinformatics companies|bioinformatics companies]] or public institutions.\n\n===Open-source bioinformatics software===\nMany [[free and open-source software]] tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.<ref name=obf-main>{{cite web |title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: About us |url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page |website=Official website |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> The combination of a continued need for new [[algorithm]]s for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative ''[[in silico]]'' experiments, and freely available [[open code]] bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open-source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] in commercial applications. They may also provide ''[[de facto]]'' standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.\n\nThe [[List of open-source bioinformatics software|range of open-source software packages]] includes titles such as [[Bioconductor]], [[BioPerl]], [[Biopython]], [[BioJava]], [[BioJS]], [[BioRuby]], [[Bioclipse]], [[EMBOSS]], [[.NET Bio]], [[Orange (software)|Orange]] with its bioinformatics add-on, [[Apache Taverna]], [[UGENE]] and [[GenoCAD]].

This system allows the database to be accessed and updated by all experts in the field.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Broh\u00e9e |first1=Sylvain |last2=Barriot |first2=Roland |last3=Moreau |first3=Yves |title=Biological knowledge bases using Wikis: combining the flexibility of Wikis with the structure of databases |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/17/2210.full |website=Bioinformatics |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Web services in bioinformatics===\n[[SOAP]]- and [[REST]]-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.\n\nBasic bioinformatics services are classified by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] into three categories: [[Sequence alignment software|SSS]] (Sequence Search Services), [[Multiple sequence alignment|MSA]] (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and [[Bioinformatics#Sequence analysis|BSA]] (Biological Sequence Analysis).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nisbet |first=Robert |others=John Elder IV, Gary Miner |title=Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5np34a5fmQC&pg=PA328&q=bioinformatics%20service%20categories%20EBI |accessdate=9 May 2014 |publisher=Academic Press |date=14 May 2009 |pages=328 |chapter=BIOINFORMATICS |isbn=9780080912035 }}</ref> The availability of these [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible [[bioinformatics workflow management systems]].\n\n===Bioinformatics workflow management systems===\n{{main|Bioinformatics workflow management systems}}\n\nA [[Bioinformatics workflow management systems|bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized form of a [[workflow management system]] designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application. Such systems are designed to\n* provide an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows,\n* provide interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time,\n* simplify the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists, and\n* enable scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.\n\nSome of the platforms giving this service: [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]], [[Kepler scientific workflow system|Kepler]], [[Apache Taverna|Taverna]], [[UGENE]], [[Anduril (workflow engine)|Anduril]], [[High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment|HIVE]].\n\n=== BioCompute and BioCompute Objects ===\nIn 2014, the [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]] sponsored a conference held at the [[National Institutes of Health]] Bethesda Campus to discuss reproducibility in bioinformatics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm389561.htm|title=Advancing Regulatory Science - Sept. 24-25, 2014 Public Workshop: Next Generation Sequencing Standards|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Over the next three years, a consortium of stakeholders met regularly to discuss what would become BioCompute paradigm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simonyan|first=Vahan|last2=Goecks|first2=Jeremy|last3=Mazumder|first3=Raja|date=2017|title=Biocompute Objects\u2014A Step towards Evaluation and Validation of Biomedical Scientific Computations|journal=PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=136\u2013146|doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2016.006734|issn=1079-7440|pmc=5510742|pmid=27974626}}</ref> These stakeholders included representatives from government, industry, and academic entities. Session leaders represented numerous branches of the FDA and NIH Institutes and Centers, non-profit entities including the [[Human Variome Project]] and the [[European Federation for Medical Informatics]], and research institutions including [[Stanford University|Stanford]], the [[New York Genome Center]], and the [[George Washington University]].\n\nIt was decided that the BioCompute paradigm would be in the form of digital \u2018lab notebooks\u2019 which allow for the reproducibility, replication, review, and reuse, of bioinformatics protocols. This was proposed to enable greater continuity within a research group over the course of normal personnel flux while it furthering the exchange of ideas between groups. The US FDA funded this work so that information on pipelines would be more transparent and accessible to their regulatory staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm491893.htm|title=Advancing Regulatory Science - Community-based development of HTS standards for validating data and computation and encouraging interoperability|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the group reconvened at the NIH in Bethesda and discussed the potential for a [[BioCompute Object]], an instance of the BioCompute paradigm.

His prominent films include mainstream box office hits such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]''  (1980), ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983), ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987), and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996), as well as [[cult film|cult favorites]] such as ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'' (1973), ''[[Blow Out]]'' (1981), ''[[Body Double]]'' (1984), ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' (1993), and ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2002).<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Steve |title=Steve Rose Talks to Director Brian De Palma |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/08/1 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDe Palma is often cited as a leading member of the [[New Hollywood]] generation of film directors.<ref name=AVprimer>Murray, Noel; Tobias, Scott (March 10, 2011).

De Palma subsequently enrolled at the newly coed [[Sarah Lawrence College]] as a graduate student in their theater department in the early 1960s, becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher [[Wilford Leach]], the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades.\n\nAn early association with a young [[Robert De Niro]] resulted in ''[[The Wedding Party (1969 film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the [[Greenwich Village]] filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as \"Robert {{sic|hide=y|Den|ero}}.\" The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the [[jump-cut]] for effect. De Palma followed this style with various small films for the [[NAACP]] and The [[U.S. Treasury Department|Treasury Department]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably ''The Responsive Eye'', a 1966 movie about ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'' [[op-art]] exhibit curated by William Seitz for [[MOMA]] in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as \"very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gelmis |first=Joseph |authorlink= |title=The Film Director as Superstar |year=1970 |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City |page=24}}</ref>\n\n''[[Dionysus (film)|Dionysus in 69]]'' (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records [[The Performance Group]]'s performance of Euripides' [[The Bacchae]], starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]]. De Palma recalls that he was \"floored\" by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he \"began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Knapp |first=Lawrence |title=Brian De Palma Interviews |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |page=26}}</ref>\n\nDe Palma's most significant features from this decade are ''[[Greetings (1968 film)|Greetings]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hi, Mom!]]'' (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a [[Leftist]] [[revolutionary]] viewpoint common to their era. ''Greetings'' was entered into the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won a [[Silver Bear]] award.<ref name=\"berlinale 1969\">{{Cite web|title=Berlinale 1969: Prize Winners |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1969/03_preistr_ger_1969/03_Preistraeger_1969.html |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]''. Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and [[intertextuality]], reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the \"American [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]]\" while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work.<ref>Brody, Richard. ''Everything Is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard''. p. 323.</ref>\n\n''Greetings'' is about three New Yorkers dealing with the draft. The film is often considered the first to deal explicitly with the draft. The film is noteworthy for its use of various experimental techniques to convey its narrative in ultimately unconventional ways. Footage was sped up, rapid cutting was used to distance the audience from the narrative, and it was difficult to discern with whom the audience must ultimately align. \"Greetings\" ultimately grossed over $1 million at the box office and cemented De Palma's position as a bankable filmmaker.\n\nAfter the success of his 1968 breakthrough, De Palma and his producing partner, Charles Hirsch, were given the opportunity by Sigma 3 to make an unofficial sequel of sorts, initially entitled ''Son of Greetings'', and subsequently released as ''Hi, Mom!''. While \"Greetings\" accentuated its varied cast, ''Hi, Mom!'' focuses on De Niro's character, Jon Rubin, an essential carry-over from the previous film. The film is ultimately significant insofar as it displays the first enunciation of De Palma's style in all its major traits \u2013 voyeurism, guilt, and a hyper-consciousness of the medium are all on full display, not just as hallmarks, but built into this formal, material apparatus itself.\n\nThese traits come to the fore in ''Hi, Mom!'''s \"[[Be Black, Baby]]\" sequence. This sequence parodies [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]], the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of [[Brecht]]ian distanciation: \"First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In ''Hi, Mom!'' for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same time that you are emotionally involved with it.\"\n\n\"Be Black, Baby\" was filmed in black and white stock on 16&nbsp;mm, in low-light conditions that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of \"realism.\" In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes \"[Be Black, Baby] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action.\" Furthermore, \"I wanted to show in ''Hi, Mom!'' how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise \u2013 \"Be Black, Baby\" \u2013 and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, \"It's just a movie, right? It's not real.\" It's just like television. You're sucked in all the time, and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The \"Be Black, Baby\" section of ''Hi, Mom!'' is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done.\"\n\n==Transition to Hollywood==\nIn the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he worked on bigger budget films. In 1970, De Palma left New York for Hollywood at age thirty to make ''[[Get to Know Your Rabbit]]'', starring [[Orson Welles]] and [[Tommy Smothers]]. Making the film was a crushing experience for De Palma, as Smothers did not  like many of De Palma's ideas.<ref name=Salamon26>Salamon, p. 26.</ref>\n\nAfter several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', a small film based on the [[Carrie (novel)|1974 novel ''Carrie'']] was released directed by Brian De Palma. The [[psychic]] thriller ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by [[United Artists]], and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as [[Stephen King]]'s source novel had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[John Travolta]] had gained attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic [[situation comedy|sitcoms]]. ''Carrie'' became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and [[Piper Laurie]] Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url=http://www.life.com/gallery/61531/image/2661928/almost-cast-who-lost-iconic-roles#index/53 |title=Almost Cast: Who Lost Iconic Roles? |publisher=''Life'' |year=}}</ref> The \"shock ending\" finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of [[split screen (film)|split-screen]], split-diopter and [[slow motion]] shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.\n\nThe financial and critical success of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and [[avant-garde]] storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen (Steven Spielberg's adaptation of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of ''The Demolished Man''). The result of his experience with adapting ''The Demolished Man'' was ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'', a science fiction psychic thriller that starred [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Carrie Snodgress]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Amy Irving]]. The film was admired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], who featured a clip in his mammoth [[Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma]], and [[Pauline Kael]] who championed both ''The Fury'' and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', the thematic complex thriller for which he is now better known.\n\nFor many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, most notably ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Carlito's Way]]'', pushed the envelope of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary from one another in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of ''Scarface'' contrast with the more emotional tragedy of ''Carlito's Way''. Both films feature Al Pacino in what has become a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song ''[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]''. The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', ''[[Blow Out]]'', ''[[Body Double]]'', and ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]''.\n\nLater into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies (''Mission: Impossible'', ''Carlito's Way'') worked and some others (''Raising Cain'', ''Mission to Mars'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'') failed at the box office. Notably, ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' failed at the box office but has since developed a cult status amongst cinephiles.\n\nA more political controversy erupted in a later movie from De Palma, ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'' (2007), which had the subject of American involvement in [[Iraq]], including the committing of war atrocities there. It received limited release in the United States and grossed less than $1 million.\n\nIn 2012, his film ''[[Passion (2012 film)|Passion]]'' was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[69th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"labiennale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69/ |title=Venezia 69 |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |work=labiennale |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728223053/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69 |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2015, he was the subject of a documentary film, ''[[De Palma (film)|De Palma]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=David Rooney|title='De Palma': Venice Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/noah-baumbach-jake-paltrows-de-821141|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 Brian De Palma began the shoot of the [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Domino (2018 film)|Domino]]'' in [[M\u00e1laga]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=A.

He has often produced \"De Palma\" films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and [[graphic violence]] of some of De Palma's films, such as ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Scarface'' and ''Body Double'', they are often at the center of controversy with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], [[Film criticism|film critics]] and the viewing public.<ref name=AVprimer/>\n\nDe Palma is known for quoting and referencing other directors' work throughout his career. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]'' plots were used for the basis of ''Blow Out''. ''The Untouchables''{{'}} finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the [[Odessa]] Steps sequence in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. The main plot from ''[[Rear Window]]'' was used for ''Body Double'', while it also used elements of ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. ''Vertigo'' was also the basis for ''Obsession''. ''Dressed to Kill'' was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.<ref name=AVprimer/>\n\n===Camera shots===\nFilm critics have often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and compositions throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a [[Dutch angle|canted angle shot]]. [[split screen (film)|Split-screen]] techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously.<ref name=AVprimer/> To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a [[Circle|360-degree]] camera [[Panning (camera)|pan]]. Slow sweeping, panning and [[tracking shot]]s are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed [[long take]]s lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as \"di-opt\", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.<ref name=AVprimer/>\n\n==Collaborations==\n===Actors===\n<div class=\"noprint\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:75%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

This design caused stability problems. \"Flattening\" the outer wing panels by giving them a slight anhedral angle just outboard of the engine nacelles nullified the problem, and gave the B-25 its [[gull wing]] configuration.<ref name=\"chor aero p74\">Chorlton ''Aeroplane'' May 2013, p. 74.</ref> Less noticeable changes during this period included an increase in the size of the tail fins and a decrease in their inward tilt at their tops.\n\nNAA continued design and development in 1940 and 1941. Both the B-25A and B-25B series entered USAAF service. The B-25B was operational in 1942. Combat requirements led to further developments. Before the year was over, NAA was producing the B-25C and B-25D series at different plants. Also in 1942, the manufacturer began design work on the cannon-armed B-25G series. The NA-100 of 1943 and 1944 was an interim armament development at the Kansas City complex known as the B-25D2. Similar armament upgrades by U.S-based commercial modification centers involved about half of the B-25G series. Further development led to the B-25H, B-25J, and B-25J2. The gunship design concept dates to late 1942 and NAA sent a field technical representative to the SWPA. The factory-produced B-25G entered production during the NA-96 order followed by the redesigned B-25H gunship. The B-25J reverted to the bomber role, but it, too, could be outfitted as a strafer.\n\n[[File:B25-1 300.jpg|thumb|Late war development B-25J2 Mitchell strafer bomber|alt=Black and white photo of an early bomber parked perpendicular to camera, facing left, rearward of the wing is a star in front of horizontal stripes.]]\n\nNAA manufactured the greatest number of aircraft in World War II, the first time a company had produced trainers, bombers, and fighters simultaneously (the AT-6/SNJ Texan, B-25 Mitchell, and the P-51 Mustang).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It produced B-25s at both its Inglewood main plant and an additional 6,608 aircraft at its [[Kansas City, Kansas]] plant at [[Fairfax Airport]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated70\" /><ref>Herman 2012, pp. 11, 88, 115, 140\u2013143, 263, 297.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the USAF placed a contract for the TB-25L trainer in 1952. This was a modification program by Hayes of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Its primary role was reciprocal engine pilot training.\n\nA development of the B-25 was the [[North American XB-28 Dragon|North American XB-28]], designed as a high-altitude bomber. Two prototypes were built with the second prototype, the XB-28A, evaluated as a photo-reconnaissance platform, but the aircraft did not enter production.<ref>Norton 2012, p. 68.</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Lt. Preddy and crew of 3d Antisubmarine Squadron.jpg|thumb|Crew and their B-25]]\n[[File:USS Hornet flight deck April 1942.jpg|thumb|[[Doolittle Raid]] B-25Bs aboard USS ''Hornet'']]\n\n=== Asia-Pacific ===\nThe majority of B-25s in American service were used in [[Pacific War|the war against Japan in Asia and the Pacific]]. The Mitchell fought from the Northern Pacific to the South Pacific and the Far East. These areas included the campaigns in the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the Solomon Islands, [[New Britain]], China, Burma and the [[island hopping campaign]] in the Central Pacific. The aircraft's potential as a ground-[[attack aircraft]] emerged during the Pacific war. The jungle environment reduced the usefulness of medium-level bombing, and made low-level attack the best tactic. Using similar mast height level tactics and skip bombing, the B-25 proved itself to be a capable anti-shipping weapon and sank many enemy sea vessels of various types. An ever-increasing number of forward firing guns made the B-25 a formidable strafing aircraft for island warfare. The strafer versions were the B-25C1/D1, the B-25J1 and with the NAA strafer nose, the J2 sub-series.\n\nIn Burma, the B-25 was often used to attack Japanese communication links, especially bridges in central Burma. It also helped supply the  [[Battle of Imphal|besieged troops at Imphal]] in 1944. The China Air Task Force, the Chinese American Composite Wing, the First Air Commando Group, the 341st Bomb Group, and eventually, the relocated 12th Bomb Group, all operated the B-25 in the [[China Burma India Theater]] (CBI). Many of these missions involved battle field isolation, interdiction and close air support.\n\nLater in the war, as the USAAF acquired bases in other parts of the Pacific, the Mitchell could strike targets in [[Indochina]], [[Formosa]] and [[Kyushu]], increasing the usefulness of the B-25. It was also used in some of the shortest raids of the Pacific War, striking from [[Saipan]] against [[Guam]] and [[Tinian]]. The 41st Bomb Group used it against Japanese-occupied islands that had been bypassed by the main campaign, such as happened in the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\n=== Middle East and Italy ===\nThe first B-25s arrived in Egypt and were carrying out independent operations by October 1942.<ref>Pace, 2002 p23</ref> Operations there against Axis airfields and motorized vehicle columns supported the ground actions of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Thereafter, the aircraft took part in the rest of the [[North Africa campaign|campaign in North Africa]], the [[invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|advance up Italy]]. In the Strait of Messina to the Aegean Sea the B-25 conducted sea sweeps as part of the coastal air forces. In Italy, the B-25 was used in the [[ground attack]] role, concentrating on attacks against road and rail links in Italy, Austria and the Balkans. The B-25 had a longer range than the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] and [[Douglas A-26 Invader]]s, allowing it to reach further into occupied Europe. The five bombardment groups \u2013 20 squadrons \u2013 of the Ninth and Twelfth Air Forces that used the B-25 in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] were the only U.S. units to employ the B-25 in Europe.<ref>Pace 2002, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe RAF received nearly 900 Mitchells, using them to replace [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Bostons]], [[Lockheed Ventura]]s and [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers. The Mitchell entered active RAF service on 22 January 1943. At first, it was used to bomb targets in occupied Europe. After the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] invasion, the RAF and France used Mitchells in support of the Allies in Europe. Several squadrons moved to forward airbases on the continent. The USAAF did not use the B-25 in combat in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|ETO]].\n\n=== USAAF ===\n[[File:Army B-25 (Doolittle Raid).jpg|thumb|A B-25 Mitchell taking off from USS ''Hornet'' for the Doolittle Raid]]\n\nThe B-25B first gained fame as the bomber used in the 18 April 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]], in which 16 B-25Bs led by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Jimmy Doolittle]] attacked mainland Japan, four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The mission gave a much-needed lift in spirits to the Americans, and alarmed the Japanese, who had believed their home islands to be inviolable by enemy forces. Although the amount of actual damage done was relatively minor, it forced the Japanese to divert troops for home defense for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe raiders took off from the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} and successfully bombed Tokyo and four other Japanese cities without loss. Fifteen of the bombers subsequently crash-landed en route to recovery fields in eastern China. These losses were the result of the task force being spotted by a Japanese vessel, forcing the bombers to take off {{convert|170|mi|km|abbr=on}} early, fuel exhaustion, stormy nighttime conditions with zero visibility, and lack of electronic homing aids at the recovery bases. Only one B-25 bomber landed intact, in [[Siberia]] where its five-man crew was interned and the aircraft confiscated. Of the 80 aircrew, 69 survived their historic mission and eventually made it back to American lines.\n\nFollowing a number of additional modifications, including the addition of [[Plexiglas]] dome for navigational sightings to replace the overhead window for the navigator and heavier nose armament, [[De-ice|de-icing]] and anti-icing equipment, the B-25C entered USAAF operations. Through block 20 the B-25C and B-25D differed only in location of manufacture: C series at [[Inglewood, California]]; D series at [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. After block 20 some NA-96 began the transition to the G series while some NA-87 acquired interim modifications eventually produced as the B-25D2 and ordered as the NA-100. NAA built a total of 3,915 B-25Cs and Ds during World War II.\n\nAlthough the B-25 was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight, it was used frequently in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific theatre]] in treetop-level [[strafing]] and missions with parachute-retarded fragmentation bombs against Japanese airfields in [[New Guinea]] and the Philippines. These heavily armed Mitchells were field-modified at [[Townsville]], Australia, under the direction of Major [[Paul I. \"Pappy\" Gunn]] and North American tech rep Jack Fox. These \"commerce destroyers\" were also used on strafing and [[skip bombing]] missions against Japanese shipping trying to resupply their armies.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Lieutenant General]] [[George C. Kenney]], Mitchells of the Far East Air Forces and its existing components, the [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s devastated Japanese targets in the Southwest Pacific Theater during 1944 to 1945. The USAAF played a significant role in pushing the Japanese back to their home islands. The type operated with great effect in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Central Pacific]], [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|Alaska]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]], [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India]] (CBI) theaters.\n\nThe USAAF Antisubmarine Command made great use of the B-25 in 1942 and 1943. Some of the earliest B-25 Bomb Groups also flew the Mitchell on coastal patrols after the Pearl Harbor attack, prior to the AAFAC organization. Many of the two dozen or so Antisubmarine Squadrons flew the B-25C, D and G series in the American Theater Antisubmarine campaign, often in the distinctive, white sea search camouflage.\n\n==== Combat developments ====\n\n===== Use as a gunship =====\n\n<!-- Gunship links here -->\n[[File:North American B-25 Mitchell.JPG|thumb|A view of a B-25G shows the mid-ship location of dorsal turret continued.]]\nIn anti-shipping operations, the USAAF had urgent need for hard-hitting aircraft, and North American responded with the B-25G. In this series the transparent nose and bombardier/navigator position was changed for a shorter, hatched nose with two fixed .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns and a [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) M4 cannon]],<ref name=Merriam>Merriam, Ray, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7GjzzNMpu4C&lpg=PA8&pg=PA8 \"U. S. Warplanes of World War II.\"] ''World War II Journal, No. 15,'' 1 July 2000, p. 8.</ref> one of the largest weapons fitted to an aircraft, similar to the British [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|57&nbsp;mm gun]]-armed [[De_Havilland_Mosquito#Strike_(\"fighter-bomber\")_variants|Mosquito Mk. XVIII]] and the German [[Henschel_Hs_129#Hs_129_B-3|Henschel Hs 129B-3]], and [[Junkers_Ju_88#Ju_88P|Ju 88P]] heavy cannon (up to a 75&nbsp;mm long-barrel ''Bordkanone BK 7,5''). The shorter nose placed the cannon breech behind the pilot where it could be manually loaded and serviced by the navigator; his crew station was moved to a position just behind the pilot. The navigator signalled the pilot when the gun was ready and the pilot fired the weapon using a button on his control wheel.\n\nThe Royal Air Force, U.S. Navy and the Soviet VVS each conducted trials with this series but none adopted it. The G series comprised one prototype, five pre-production C conversions, 58 C series modifications and 400 production aircraft for a total of 464 B-25G. In its final version, the G-12, an interim armament modification, eliminated the lower Bendix turret and added a starboard dual gun pack, waist guns and a canopy for the tail gunner to improve the view when firing the single tail gun. In April 1945 the air depots in Hawaii refurbished about two dozen of these and included the eight gun nose and rocket launchers in the upgrade.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe B-25H series continued the development of the gunship concept. NAA Inglewood produced 1000. The H had even more firepower. Most replaced the M4 gun with the lighter [[75 mm gun (US)#T13E1 / M5|T13E1]],<ref name=Merriam /> designed specifically for the aircraft but 20-odd H-1 block aircraft completed by the [[Republic Aviation]] modification center at Evansville had the M4 and two machine gun nose armament. The 75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) gun fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2,362|ft/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Due to its low rate of fire (about four rounds could be fired in a single [[strafing]] run), relative ineffectiveness against ground targets, and the substantial recoil, the 75&nbsp;mm gun was sometimes removed from both G and H models and replaced with two additional .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns as a field modification.<ref>Kinzey 1999, pp. 51, 53.</ref> In the new FEAF these were re-designated the G1 and H1 series respectively.\n\n[[File:B-25H.jpg|thumb|A restored B-25H \"Barbie III\" showing 75&nbsp;mm M5 gun and four 0.50 Browning with belt feeds]]\n\nThe H series normally came from the factory mounting four fixed, forward-firing .50&nbsp; (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose; four more fixed guns in forward-firing, individual gun packages; two more in the manned dorsal turret, re-located forward to a position just behind the cockpit; one each in a pair of new waist positions, introduced simultaneously with the forward-relocated dorsal turret; and lastly, a pair of guns in a new tail gunner's position. Company promotional material bragged that the B-25H could \"bring to bear 10 machine guns coming and four going, in addition to the 75&nbsp;mm cannon, eight [[unguided rocket|rockets]] and 3,000&nbsp;lb (1,360&nbsp;kg) of bombs.\"<ref>Yenne 1989, p. 40.</ref>\n\nThe H had a modified cockpit with single flight controls operated by pilot. The co-pilot's station and controls were deleted, and instead had a smaller seat used by the navigator/cannoneer, The radio operator crew position was aft the bomb bay with access to the waist guns.<ref>Kinzey 1999, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Factory production total were 405 B-25Gs and 1,000 B-25Hs, with 248 of the latter being used by the Navy as PBJ-1H.<ref name=Merriam /> Elimination of the co-pilot saved weight, moving the dorsal turret forward counterbalanced in part the waist guns and the manned rear turret.<ref>Baugher, Joe.

It optimized the mix of the interim NA-100 and the H series having both the bombardier's station and fixed guns of the D and the forward turret and refined armament of the H series. NAA also produced a strafer nose first shipped to air depots as kits, then introduced on the production line in alternating blocks with the bombardier nose. The solid-metal \"strafer\" nose housed eight centerline Browning M2 .50 calibre machine guns. The remainder of the armament was as in the H-5. NAA also supplied kits to mount eight underwing 5 \"high velocity airborne rockets\" (HVAR) just outside the propeller arcs. These were mounted on zero length launch rails, four to a wing.\n[[File:Restored B-25J Take-off Time at an air show.JPG|thumb|The restored B-25J Mitchell ''Take-Off Time'' at the [[Mid-Atlantic Air Museum]] for World War II Weekend 2015 in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]]]\nThe final, and the most built, series of the Mitchell, the '''B-25J''', looked less like earlier series apart from the well-glazed bombardier's nose of nearly-identical appearance to the earliest B-25 subtypes.<ref name=Merriam /> Instead, the J followed the overall configuration of the H series from the cockpit aft. It had the forward dorsal turret and other armament and airframe advancements. All J models included four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) light-barrel Browning AN/M2 guns in a pair of \"fuselage package\", conformal [[gun pod]]s each flanking the lower cockpit, each pod containing two [[Browning M2]]s. By 1945, however, combat squadrons removed these. The J series restored the co-pilot's seat and dual flight controls. The factory made available kits to the Air Depot system to create the strafer-nose B-25J-2. This configuration carried a total of 18 .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) light-barrel AN/M2 Browning M2 machine guns: eight in the nose, four in the flank-mount conformal gun pod packages, two in the dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail \u2013 with 14 of the guns either aimed directly forward, or aimed to fire directly forward for strafing missions. Some aircraft had eight [[5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket|5 in (130&nbsp;mm) high-velocity aircraft rockets (HVAR)]].<ref name=Merriam /> NAA introduced the J-2 into production in alternating blocks at the J-22. Total J series production was 4,318.\n\n==== Flight characteristics ====\nThe B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly.<ref>Tallman 1973, pp. 216, 228.</ref> With one engine out, 60\u00b0 banking turns into the dead engine were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h). The pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after takeoff with rudder; if this maneuver was attempted with ailerons, the aircraft could snap out of control. The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from varying degrees of [[hearing loss]].<ref name=\"dbvxho\">Higham 1975, 8; Higham 1978, 59.</ref>\n\nThe high noise level was due to design and space restrictions in the engine cowlings which resulted in the exhaust \"stacks\" protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This arrangement directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and crew compartments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==== Durability ====\n[[File:B-25 bomber is assembled.jpg|alt= B-25 Engine Assembly|thumb|B-25 engine cowling assembly]]\n\nThe Mitchell was an exceptionally sturdy aircraft that could withstand tremendous punishment. One B-25C of the [[321st Bombardment Group|321st Bomb Group]] was nicknamed \"Patches\" because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's [[flak]] hole patches with the bright yellow [[zinc chromate]] [[Primer (paint)|primer]]. By the end of the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, had been belly-landed six times and had over 400 patched holes. The airframe of \"Patches\" was so distorted from battle damage that straight-and-level flight required 8\u00b0 of left [[aileron]] trim and 6\u00b0 of right rudder, causing the aircraft to \"crab\" sideways across the sky.<ref>[http://www.usaf.com/pastplanes/b-25.htm \"A Brief history of the B-25.\"] USAF.com. Accessed: 25 May 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Post war (USAF) use ===\nIn 1947 legislation created an independent [[United States Air Force]] and by that time the B-25 inventory numbered only a few hundred. Some B-25s continued in service into the 1950s in a variety of training, reconnaissance and support roles. The principal use during this period was undergraduate training of multi-engine aircraft pilots slated for reciprocating engine or turboprop cargo, aerial refuelling or reconnaissance aircraft. Others were assigned to units of the [[Air National Guard]] in training roles in support of [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] and [[Lockheed F-94 Starfire]] operations. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn its USAF tenure, many B-25s received the so-called \"Hayes modification\" and as a result, surviving B-25 often have exhaust systems with a semi-collector ring that splits emissions into two different systems. The upper seven cylinders are collected by a ring while the other cylinders remain directed to individual ports.\n\nTB-25J-25-NC Mitchell, ''44-30854'', the last B-25 in the USAF inventory, assigned at [[March AFB]], California as of March 1960,<ref>\"Doolittle Park Will Have AF B-25 Bomber\".

Under the pre-1962 USN/USMC/USCG aircraft designation system, PBJ-1 stood for Patrol (P) Bomber (B) built by North American Aviation (J), first variant (-1) under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|existing American naval aircraft designation system of the era]]. The PBJ had its origin in an inter-service agreement of mid-1942 between the Navy and the USAAF exchanging the Boeing Renton plant for the Kansas plant for [[B-29 Superfortress]] production. The [[Boeing XPBB Sea Ranger]] flying boat, competing for B-29 engines, was cancelled in exchange for part of the Kansas City Mitchell production. Other terms included the inter-service transfer of 50 B-25C and 152 B-25D to the Navy. The bombers carried Navy [[bureau number]]s (BuNos), beginning with BuNo 34998. The first PBJ-1 arrived in February 1943 and nearly all reached Marine Corps squadrons, beginning with Marine Bombing Squadron 413 (VMB-413). Following the AAFAC format, the Marine Mitchells had search [[radar]] in a retractable radome replacing the remotely-operated ventral turret. Later D and J series had nose mounted APS-3 radar; and later still, J and H series mounted radar in the starboard wingtip. The large quantities of B-25H and J series became known as PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J respectively. These aircraft often operated along with earlier PBJ series in Marine squadrons.\n\nThe PBJs were operated almost exclusively by the Marine Corps as land-based bombers. To operate them, the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] established a number of Marine bomber squadrons (VMB), beginning with VMB-413, in March 1943 at [[MCAS Cherry Point]], North Carolina. Eight VMB squadrons were flying PBJs by the end of 1943, forming the initial Marine medium bombardment group. Four more squadrons were in the process of formation in late 1945, but had not yet deployed by the time the war ended.\n\nOperational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1s began in March 1944. The Marine PBJs operated from the Philippines, Saipan, [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Okinawa]] during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long range [[interdiction]] of enemy shipping trying to run the blockade which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried. Some VMB-612 intruder PBJ-1D and J series flew without top turrets to save weight and increase range on night patrols, especially towards the end of the war when air superiority existed.\n\nDuring the war the Navy tested the cannon-armed G series and conducted carrier trial with an H equipped with arresting gear. After World War II, some PBJs stationed at the Navy's then-rocket laboratory site in [[Inyokern, California]], site of the present-day [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]], tested various air-to-ground rockets and arrangements. One  arrangement was a twin-barrel nose arrangement that could fire 10 spin-stabilized five-inch rockets in one salvo.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=O-ADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA113&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Smash Hits.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1947, p. 113.</ref>\n\n=== Royal Air Force ===\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was an early customer for the B-25 via [[Lend-Lease]]. The first Mitchells were given the service name Mitchell I by the RAF and were delivered in August 1941, to No. 111 Operational Training Unit based in [[the Bahamas]]. These bombers were used exclusively for training and familiarization and never achieved operational status. The B-25Cs and Ds were designated Mitchell II. Altogether, 167 B-25Cs and 371 B-25Ds were delivered to the RAF. The RAF tested the cannon-armed G series but did not adopt the series nor the follow-on H series.\n\nBy the end of 1942 the RAF had taken delivery of a total of 93 Mitchell marks I and II. Some served with squadrons of [[No. 2 Group RAF]], the RAF's tactical medium bomber force. The first RAF operation with the Mitchell II took place on 22 January 1943, when six aircraft from [[No. 180 Squadron RAF]] attacked oil installations at [[Ghent]]. After the invasion of Europe (by which point 2 Group was part of [[Second Tactical Air Force]]), all four Mitchell squadrons moved to bases in France and Belgium (Melsbroek) to support Allied ground forces. The British Mitchell squadrons were joined by [[No. 342 Squadron RAF|No. 342 (Lorraine) Squadron]] of the [[French Air Force]] in April 1945.\n\nAs part of its move from Bomber Command, [[No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron|No 305 (Polish) Squadron]] flew Mitchell IIs from September to December 1943 before converting to the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. In addition to No. 2 Group, the B-25 was used by various second-line RAF units in the UK and abroad. In the Far East, No. 3 PRU, which consisted of [[No. 681 Squadron RAF|Nos. 681]] and 684 Squadrons, flew the Mitchell (primarily Mk IIs) on photographic reconnaissance sorties.\n\nThe RAF was allocated 316 B-25J which entered service as the Mitchell III. Deliveries took place between August 1944 and August 1945. However, only about 240 of these bombers actually reached Britain, with some being diverted to No. 111 [[Operational training unit|OTU]] in the Bahamas, some crashing during delivery and some being retained in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Royal Canadian Air Force ===\nThe [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) used the B-25 Mitchell for training during the war. Post-war use saw continued operations with most of 162 Mitchells received. The first B-25s had originally been diverted to Canada from RAF orders. These included one Mitchell I, 42 Mitchell IIs, and 19 Mitchell IIIs. No 13 (P) Squadron was formed unofficially at [[Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport|RCAF Rockcliffe]] in May 1944 and used Mitchell IIs on high-altitude aerial photography sorties. No. 5 OTU (Operational Training Unit) at Boundary Bay, British Columbia and Abbotsford, British Columbia, operated the B-25D Mitchell in the training role together with B-24 Liberators for Heavy Conversion as part of the BCATP.

It was followed by No 406 (auxiliary), which flew Mitchell IIs and IIIs from April 1947 to June 1958. No 418 Operated a mix of IIs and IIIs until March 1958. No 12 Squadron of Air Transport Command also flew Mitchell IIIs along with other types from September 1956 to November 1960. In 1951, the RCAF received an additional 75 B-25Js from USAF stocks to make up for attrition and to equip various second-line units.<ref>Walker, R.W.R.

The joint Australian-Dutch [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF]] had more than enough Mitchells for one squadron, so the surplus went to re-equip the RAAF's [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Squadron]], replacing their Beauforts.\n\n=== Dutch Air Force ===\n[[File:18 Sqn (AWM P02769-001).jpg|thumb|B-25 Mitchells assigned to [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF]] in 1943]]\nDuring World War II, the Mitchell served in fairly large numbers with the Air Force of the Dutch government-in-exile. They participated in combat in the East Indies as well as on the European front. On 30 June 1941, the Netherlands Purchasing Commission, acting on behalf of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, signed a contract with North American Aviation for 162 B-25C aircraft. The bombers were to be delivered to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] to help deter any Japanese aggression into the region.\n\nIn February 1942, the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) agreed to ferry 20 Dutch B-25s from Florida to Australia travelling via Africa and India, and an additional ten via the South Pacific route from California. During March, five of the bombers on the Dutch order had reached [[Bangalore]], India and 12 had reached Archerfield in Australia. It was agreed that the B-25s in Australia would be used as the nucleus of a new squadron, designated No. 18. This squadron was staffed jointly by Australian and Dutch aircrews plus a smattering of aircrews from other nations, and operated under Royal Australian Air Force command for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe B-25s of No. 18 Squadron were painted with the Dutch national insignia (at this time a rectangular Netherlands flag) and carried NEIAF serials. Discounting the ten \"temporary\" B-25s delivered to 18 Squadron in early 1942, a total of 150 Mitchells were taken on strength by the NEIAF, 19 in 1942, 16 in 1943, 87 in 1944, and 28 in 1945. They flew bombing raids against Japanese targets in the East Indies. In 1944, the more capable B-25J Mitchell replaced most of the earlier C and D models.\n\nIn June 1940, [[No. 320 Squadron RAF]] had been formed from personnel formerly serving with the [[Netherlands Naval Aviation Service|Royal Dutch Naval Air Service]] who had escaped to England after the German occupation of the Netherlands. Equipped with various British aircraft, No. 320 Squadron flew anti-submarine patrols, convoy escort missions, and performed air-sea rescue duties. They acquired the Mitchell II in September 1943, performing operations over Europe against gun emplacements, railway yards, bridges, troops and other tactical targets. They moved to Belgium in October 1944, and transitioned to the Mitchell III in 1945. No. 320 Squadron was disbanded in August 1945. Following the war, B-25s were used by Dutch forces during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].\n\n=== Soviet Air Force ===\nThe U.S. supplied 862 B-25s (B, D, G, and J types) to the Soviet Union under [[Lend-Lease]] during World War II via the Alaska\u2013Siberia [[ALSIB]] ferry route.\n\nOther damaged aircraft arrived or crashed in the Far East of Russia, and one Doolittle Raid aircraft landed there short of fuel after attacking Japan. The lone airworthy aircraft to reach the Soviet Union was lost in a hangar fire in the early 50s while undergoing routine maintenance. In general, the B-25 was operated as a ground-support and tactical daylight bomber (as similar Douglas A-20 Havocs were used). It saw action in fights from Stalingrad (with B/D models) to the German surrender during May 1945 (with G/J types).\n\nB-25s that remained in Soviet Air Force service after the war were assigned the [[NATO reporting name]] \"'''Bank'''\".\n\n=== China ===\nWell over 100 B-25Cs and Ds were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In addition, a total of 131 B-25Js were supplied to China under Lend-Lease.\n\nThe four squadrons of the 1st BG (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) of the 1st Medium Bomber Group were formed during the war. They formerly operated Russian-built [[Tupolev SB]] bombers, then transferred to the B-25. The 1st BG was under the command of CACW (Chinese-American Composite Wing) while operating B-25s. Following the end of the war in the Pacific, these four bombardment squadrons were established to fight against the Communist insurgency that was rapidly spreading throughout the country. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Chinese Mitchells fought alongside de Havilland Mosquitos.\n\nIn December 1948, the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan, taking many of their Mitchells with them. However, some B-25s were left behind and were pressed into service with the air force of the new People's Republic of China.\n\n=== Brazilian Air Force ===\n[[File:B-25J Mitchell - s-n 44-30069 - at Museu Aerospacial in Campos dos Afonsos Air Force Base - Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|right|B-25J Mitchell  ''44-30069'' at ''Museu Aerospacial'' in ''Campos dos Afonsos Air Force Base'', Rio de Janeiro]]\n\nDuring the war, the For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Brasileira ([[Brazilian Air Force|FAB]]) received a few B-25s under Lend-Lease. Brazil declared war against the Axis powers in August 1942 and participated in the war against the U-boats in the southern Atlantic. The last Brazilian B-25 was finally declared surplus in 1970.\n\n=== Free French ===\nThe Royal Air Force issued at least 21 Mitchell IIIs to No 342 Squadron, which was made up primarily of Free French aircrews. Following the liberation of France, this squadron transferred to the newly formed [[French Air Force]] (''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'') as GB I/20 Lorraine. The aircraft continued in operation after the war, with some being converted into fast VIP transports. They were struck off charge in June 1947.\n\n=== Biafra ===\nIn October 1967, during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], [[Biafra]] bought 2 Mitchells. After a few bombings in November, they were put out of action in December.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|year=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092|page=18|ref={{harvid|Jowett|2016}}}}</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:North American B-25C Mitchell (00910460 178).jpg|thumb|B-25C Mitchell]]\n[[File:77BS B-25.jpg|thumb|USAAF B-25C/D.

He played almost all of his club football at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he became renowned for his attacking instincts and passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot. He was also well known for his fitness and stamina. He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. His elder brother [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], who was also in the World Cup-winning team, is a former [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and international manager.\n\nBorn in [[Ashington]], [[Northumberland]], Charlton made his debut for the Manchester United first-team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the [[Munich air disaster]] of 1958 after being rescued by [[Harry Gregg]]. After helping United to win [[the Football League]] in 1965, he won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] medal with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]], scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He is United's second all-time leading goal scorer (249), being surpassed by Wayne Rooney, and held the distinction of being England's all-time top goal scorer (49) from May 1968 to September 2015, when again Wayne Rooney surpassed his record. Charlton held the record for most appearances for Manchester United (758), before being surpassed by [[Ryan Giggs]] in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Giggs nears Reds all-time record |work=BBC Sport | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7382189.stm | date=3 May 2008 | accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nHe was selected for four World Cups ([[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] and [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]), and helped England to win the competition in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966]]. At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been held by [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Peter Shilton]].\n\nHe left Manchester United to become manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for the 1973\u201374 season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bobby Charlton |work=britannica.com/eb |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002215 |accessdate=28 January 2006 }}</ref> He changed to player-manager the following season.

However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie.<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=19}}</ref> His elder brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United.\n\n==Club career==\nOn 9 February 1953, then a [[Bedlington Grammar School]] pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] chief scout [[Joe Armstrong (football scout)|Joe Armstrong]].<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=46}}</ref> Charlton went on to play for [[English Schools' Football Association|England Schoolboys]] and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with [[Wilf McGuinness]], also aged 15.<ref>{{Cite book|last=White|first=John D.T.|title=The Official Manchester United Almanac|edition=1st|date=29 May 2008|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-7528-9192-7|page=2|chapter=January}}</ref> Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an [[apprenticeship]] as an electrical engineer; however, he went on to turn professional in October 1954.<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=62}}</ref>\n\nCharlton became one of the famed [[Busby Babes]], the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at [[Old Trafford]] in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the [[Second World War]]. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his [[National service]] with the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] in [[Shrewsbury]], where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for Manchester United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in Shrewsbury at the same time was his United teammate [[Duncan Edwards]].<ref>Charlton 2007, p.70</ref>\n\nCharlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 away win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the February. United won the [[list of English football champions|league championship]] but were denied the 20th century's first \"double\" when they controversially lost the [[1957 FA Cup Final]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper [[Ray Wood]] carried off with a broken [[cheek]]bone after a clash with Villa centre forward [[Peter McParland]]. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate [[Jackie Blanchflower]] who ended up between the posts.\n\nCharlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]. Previously, [[the Football Association]] had scorned the competition, but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play [[Red Star Belgrade]]. In the first leg at home, United won 2\u20131. The return in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3\u20130 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3\u20133 draw. However, United maintained their [[aggregate score|aggregate]] lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] at the weekend.\n\n===Munich air disaster===\n{{see also|Munich air disaster}}\n\nThe aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from [[Zemun|Zemun Airport]] needed to stop in [[Munich]] to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.\n\nThe team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate [[Dennis Viollet]] swapped places with [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[David Pegg]], who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.\n\nThe plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.\n\nCharlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper [[Harry Gregg]] (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.\n\nCharlton suffered cuts to his head and severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain [[Roger Byrne]] was also killed, along with [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]], [[Liam Whelan|Billy Whelan]], [[Eddie Colman]] and [[Geoff Bent]]. [[Duncan Edwards]] died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that [[slush]] on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.\n\nOf the 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad), 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injuries in the crash. Charlton survived with minor injuries. Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again.\n\nCharlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital. [[Harry Gregg]] and [[Bill Foulkes]] were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured. He arrived back in England on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season.\n\n===Resuming his career===\nCharlton returned to playing in an [[FA cup]] tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 1\u20130. Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the semi-finals to a 5\u20132 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and [[Nat Lofthouse]] scored twice to give [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] a 2\u20130 win.\n\nFurther success with Manchester United came at last when they beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 3\u20131 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of ''[[Football Writers' Association|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]]'' and ''[[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]]'' into the competition.\n\nIn 1968, Manchester United reached the [[1968 European Cup Final|European Cup final]], ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4\u20131 win after extra time against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and, as United captain, lifted the trophy.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in [[Football in England|England]], and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars [[George Best]] and [[Denis Law]], and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], saying that \"to do so would be hypocritical\".<ref>Crick and Smith (1990), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref> Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the [[1972\u201373 Manchester United F.C. season|1972\u201373]] season, having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which [[Ryan Giggs]] broke in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]].\n\nHis last game was against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 28 April 1973, and before the game the BBC cameras for ''[[Match of the Day]]'' captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case. The match ended in a 1-0 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|title=28 April 1973 League Division One vs Chelsea|url=http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/28-04-1973-chelsea.html|work=aboutmanutd.com|accessdate=18 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212154938/http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/28-04-1973-chelsea.html|archivedate=12 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His final goal came a month earlier, on 31 March, in a 2-0 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], also in the First Division.<ref>{{cite web|title=31 March 1973 League Division One vs Southampton|url=http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/31-03-1973-southampton.html|work=aboutmanutd.com|accessdate=18 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308132524/http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/31-03-1973-southampton.html|archivedate=8 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1969 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at The Sportsman's Club in central London.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Bobby charlton elgrafico.JPG|thumb|upright|Charlton on the cover of the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] sports magazine ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]'', 27 June 1962]]\nCharlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the [[England national football team|England]] squad for a [[British Home Championship]] game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]] on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster.\n\nCharlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4\u20130, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger [[Tom Finney]]. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 2\u20131 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to [[Belgrade]] to play his third match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. England lost that game 5\u20130 and Charlton played poorly.\n\n===1958 World Cup===\nHe was selected for the squad which competed at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], but did not kick a ball, something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade.\n\nIn 1959 he scored a [[hat-trick]] as England demolished the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] 8\u20131; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8\u20130 thrashing of [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. He also managed to score in every [[British Home Championship]] tournament he played in except [[1963 British Home Championship|1963]] in an association with the tournament that lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and 10 tournament victories (five shared).\n\n===1962 World Cup===\nHe played in qualifiers for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] in [[Chile]] against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3\u20131 group win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who went on to win the tournament.\n[[File:Jimmy Greaves and Bobby Charlton.jpg|230px|thumbnail|left|<center>Jimmy Greaves and Bobby Charlton, December 1964</center>]]\nBy now, England were coached by [[Alf Ramsey]] who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the [[committee]]-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection \u2013 it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Luckily for Charlton, he had all three.\nA hat-trick in the 8\u20131 rout of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the [[Progression of England association football goalscoring record|record]] jointly held by [[Tom Finney]] and [[Nat Lofthouse]] and Charlton's 31st goal against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in October the same year gave him the record alone.\n\nCharlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] around him. When England beat the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] 10-0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=216|work=englandfc.com|accessdate=18 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801020317/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=216|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHis goals became a little less frequent, and indeed [[Jimmy Greaves]], playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.\n\n===1966 World Cup===\nEngland drew the opening game of the tournament 0\u20130 with Uruguay, and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2\u20130 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against [[France national football team|France]], allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.\n\nEngland defeated Argentina 1\u20130 \u2013 the game was the only international match in which Charlton received a caution \u2013 and faced Portugal in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.\n\nCharlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by [[Roger Hunt]] had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from [[Geoff Hurst]]. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] beckoned.\n\nThe final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young [[Franz Beckenbauer]] effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4\u20132 after extra time.\n\n===Euro 1968===\nCharlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]], who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.\n\nWeeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by [[Jimmy Greaves]]. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championships]] where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in [[Florence]]. During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post. England defeated the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] 2\u20130 in the third place match.\n[[File:Manchester The United trinity.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"'''[[United Trinity]]'''\" statue of Charlton (right) alongside [[Denis Law]] (centre) and [[George Best]] (left) outside [[Old Trafford]]]]\nIn 1969, Charlton was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country \u2013 his 49th and final goal followed a month later in a 4\u20130 win over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] during a warm-up tour for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first \u2013 and still, to date, only \u2013 England player to feature in four World Cup squads.\n\n===1970 World Cup===\nShortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the [[Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet]] incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store. Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested.\n\nEngland began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] in the final game of the group against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.\n\nEngland duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed [[Franz Beckenbauer]]'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2\u20130 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with [[Colin Bell]] who further tested the German keeper [[Sepp Maier|Maier]] and also provided a great cross for [[Geoff Hurst]] who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice \u2013 a back header from [[Uwe Seeler]] made it 2\u20132. In extra-time, Geoff Hurst had a goal mysteriously ruled out<ref>England: The Official F.A History, Niall Edworthy, Virgin Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85227-699-1}}. p. 101</ref> after which [[Gerd M\u00fcller]]'s goal won the match 3\u20132. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.\n\nDespite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a [[BBC]] documentary. His [[Progression of England association football caps record|caps record]] lasted until 1973 when [[Bobby Moore]] overtook him, and Charlton currently lies seventh in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Ashley Cole]], [[Steven Gerrard]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Peter Shilton]], whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. Charlton's goalscoring record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney on 8 September 2015, when Rooney scored a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in a 2\u20130 win over Switzerland in a qualifying match for [[UEFA Euro 2016]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Wayne Rooney: England record is 'dream come true' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34193281 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=9 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Management career and directorships==\n[[File:Bobby2.jpg|right|thumb|Charlton at an explosives demonstration for the [[Mines Advisory Group]] and his own land mine clearance charity 'Find a Better Way' in 2008]]\nCharlton became the manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1973, signing his former United and England teammate [[Nobby Stiles]] as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation and although he began playing again he left Preston early in the 1975\u201376 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of [[John Bird (footballer, born 1948)|John Bird]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.leylandguardian.co.uk/news/big_interview_john_bird_1_163431 |title=Big Interview \u2013 John Bird |newspaper=Leyland Guardian |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=no9AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5aQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2250%2C4339777 |title=Charlton wanted |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=24 |date=22 August 1975 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> He was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] that year and began a casual association with [[BBC]] for punditry on matches, which continued for many years.

It stars [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]] and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]]. The film recounts the early exploits and later unraveling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position. The wry and doleful [[unreliable narrator]] [[Michael Hordern]] occasionally voice-overs the story.\n\nThe film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings. The exteriors were filmed on location in Ireland, England and Germany, with the interiors shot mainly in London. The production was troubled; there were logistical, political (Kubrick feared that he might be an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] hostage target), and weather-related problems, while the relationship between Kubrick and O'Neal was especially fraught and difficult. O'Neal's performance and perceived lack of on-screen depth and ability to portray a character arc have been repeatedly criticised, even by those who consider the film as one of the director's major successes.\n\n''Barry Lyndon'' won four Oscars in production categories at the 1975 [[48th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]. Although some critics took issue with the film's glacial pace and restrained emotion, like many of Kubrick's works, its reputation has strengthened over time, with many now regarding it as one of his greatest achievements.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act I===\n:''By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon''\nAn [[Omniscient narrator|omniscient]] (though possibly [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Mark Crispin|title=Barry Lyndon Reconsidered|journal=The Georgia Review|year=1976|volume=XXX|issue=4|url= http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0086.html}}</ref> narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a [[duel]] over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.\n\nBarry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until duel when Barry shoots Quin. In the aftermath, he flees from the police towards Dublin, and is robbed by [[James Freney|Captain Feeney]], a [[highwayman]].\n\nDejected, Barry joins the British Army. Some time after, he encounters Captain Grogan, a family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not in fact kill Quin, his dueling pistol having only been loaded with [[tow]]. The duel was staged by Nora's family to be rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.\n\nHis regiment is sent to Germany to fight in the [[Seven Years' War]], where Grogan is fatally wounded by the French at the [[Battle of Minden]]. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers. En route to neutral Holland he encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from [[Frederick the Great]] for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.\n\nTwo years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari, an expatriate Irishman and professional gambler. The Prussians suspect he is a spy and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry reveals himself to the Chevalier right away and they become confederates at the card table, where Barry and his fine eyesight relay information to his partner. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at the card table, the Prince accuses the Chevalier (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt and demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they (still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy) are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So, the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Prussian army officers.\n\nOver the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon. Because Lyndon is frail, sickly, and old, Barry's goading and verbal repartee ultimately send him into a fit of convulsions that ends with his death. Barry's coup-de-grace is the assertion that \"[[Last man|he who laughs last, wins]]\".\n\n===Act II===\n:''Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon''\n[[File:Marisa Berenson and Ryan O'Neal in Barry Lyndon.jpg|thumb|px240|Barry's first meeting with Lady Lyndon]]\nIn 1773, Barry takes the Countess' last name in marriage and settles in England to enjoy her wealth, still with no money of his own. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, does not approve of the marriage and quickly comes to despise Barry, calling him a \"common opportunist\" who does not truly love his mother. Barry retaliates by subjecting Bullingdon to systematic physical abuse. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.\n\nSome years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate. She warns her son that if Lady Lyndon were to die, all her wealth would go to her first-born son Lord Bullingdon, leaving Barry and his son Bryan penniless. Barry's mother advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. To further this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and begins to expend even larger sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. All this effort is wasted, however, during a birthday party for Lady Lyndon. A now young adult Lord Bullingdon crashes the event where he publicly enumerates the reasons that he detests his stepfather so dearly, declaring it his intent to leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Barry assaults Bullingdon until he is pulled off by the guests. This loses Barry the wealthy and powerful friends he has worked to entreat and he is cast out of polite society. Nevertheless, Bullingdon makes good on his word by leaving the estate and England.\n\nIn contrast to his mistreatment of his stepson, Barry proves an overindulgent and doting father to Bryan, with whom he spends all his time after Bullingdon's departure. He cannot refuse his son anything, and succumbs to Bryan's insistence on receiving a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. Defying his parents' direct instructions that he ride the horse only in the presence of his father, the spoiled Bryan is thrown from the horse, paralyzed, and dies a few days later from his injuries.\n\nThe grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Reverend Samuel Runt, who had been tutor first to Lord Bullingdon and then to Bryan. Left in charge of the families' affairs while Barry and Lady Lyndon grieve, Barry's mother dismisses the Reverend, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence worsens Lady Lyndon's condition. Plunging even deeper into grief, Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide (though she ingests only enough poison to make herself ill). The Reverend and the family's accountant Graham then seek out Lord Bullingdon. Upon hearing of these events, Lord Bullingdon returns to England where he finds Barry drunk in a gentlemen's club, mourning the loss of his son rather than being with Lady Lyndon. Bullingdon demands [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|satisfaction]] for Barry's public assault, challenging him to a duel.\n\nThe duel with pistols is held in a [[tithe barn]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kubrick: The Definitive Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=apbst3-ZYNoC|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2003-09-01|access-date = 2015-04-19|isbn = 9780571211081|first = Michel|last = Ciment|first2 = Gilbert|last2 = Adair|first3 = Robert|last3 = Bononno|page = 175}}</ref> A coin toss gives Bullingdon the right of first fire, but he nervously misfires his pistol as he prepares to shoot. Barry, reluctant to shoot Bullingdon, magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but the unmoved Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end, claiming he has not received \"satisfaction\". In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in his left leg. At a nearby inn, a surgeon informs Barry that the leg will need to be amputated below the knee if he is to survive.\n\nWhile Barry is recovering, Bullingdon re-takes control of the Lyndon estate. A few days later, Lord Bullingdon sends a very nervous Graham to the inn with a proposition: Lord Bullingdon will grant Barry an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of five hundred guineas a year on the condition that he leave England, with payments ending the moment should Barry ever return. Otherwise, with his credit and bank accounts exhausted, Barry's creditors and bill collectors will assuredly see that he is jailed. Defeated in mind and body, Barry accepts.\n\nThe narrator states that Barry went first back to Ireland with his mother, then to the European continent to resume his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). Barry kept his word and never returned to England or ever saw Lady Lyndon again. The final scene (set in December 1789) shows a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signing Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.\n\n===Epilogue===\n\n<blockquote>It was in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suits.BarryLyndon.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']][[File:Barrylyndon.suits2.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']]\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Hordern]] (''voice'') as Narrator\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Redmond Barry (later Redmond Barry Lyndon)\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Lady Lyndon\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as the Chevalier du Balibari\n* [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Captain Potzdorf\n* [[Gay Hamilton]] as Nora Brady\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as Captain Grogan\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Lord Ludd\n* [[Wolf Kahler]] as Prince of T\u00fcbingen\n* [[Marie Kean]] as Belle, Barry's mother\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Reverend Samuel Runt\n* [[Frank Middlemass]] as Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as Lord Bullingdon\n** [[Dominic Savage]] as young Bullingdon\n* [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Captain John Quin\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Lord Wendover\n* [[Anthony Sharp]] as Lord Hallam\n* [[Philip Stone]]  as Graham\n* [[David Morley (musician)|David Morley]] as Bryan Patrick Lyndon\n* [[Diana K\u00f6rner|Diana Koerner]] as Lieschen (German Girl)\n* [[Arthur O'Sullivan]] as Captain Feeney\n* [[Billy Boyle]] as Seamus Feeney\n* [[Roger Booth (actor)|Roger Booth]] as [[King George III]]\n{{div col end}}\nCritic Tim Robey suggests that the film \"makes you realise that the most undervalued aspect of Kubrick's genius could well be his way with actors.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> He adds that the [[Supporting character|supporting cast]] is a \"glittering procession of [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, not from star names but from vital character players.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nThe cast featured Leon Vitali as the older Lord Bullingdon, who would then become Kubrick's [[personal assistant]], working as the [[casting director]] on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick. Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]] also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.\n\nOther Kubrick featured regulars were Leonard Rossiter (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), Steven Berkoff, Patrick Magee and Anthony Sharp (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''). Philip Stone, who plays Graham, appeared in ''A Clockwork Orange'' and would go on to feature in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter completing post production ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Kubrick resumed planning a film about [[Napoleon]]. During pre-production,  [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released, and failed at the box office. Reconsidering, Kubrick's financiers pulled funding, and he turned his attention towards an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, \"At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film ... as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Ciment| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505010625/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nHaving earned Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of \"a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\">Robey, Tim, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4524037/Barry-Lyndon-Kubricks-neglected-masterpiece.html \"Kubrick's Neglected Masterpiece\"], in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Review'' (31 January 2009), pp. 16\u201317</ref> His studio\u2014Warner Bros.\u2014was therefore \"eager to bankroll\" his next project, which Kubrick kept \"shrouded in secrecy\" from the press partly due to the furor surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his \"long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nHaving felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 \"[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,\" ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed \"a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model, and be shot largely in Ireland.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that \"Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] took 300 days, from spring 1973 through early 1974, with a break for Christmas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0_I8BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|date = 2014-12-18|isbn = 9781441167750|language = en|first = Maria|last = Pramaggiore}}</ref> The crew arrived in [[Dublin]], Ireland in May 1973.

The house was destroyed in an accidental fire several months after filming (November 1974), so the film serves as a record of the lost interiors, particularly the \"Saloon\" which was used for more than one scene. The [[Wicklow Mountains]] are visible, for example, through the window of the saloon during a scene set in Berlin. Other locations included [[Kells Priory]] (the English Redcoat encampment)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/BarryLyndon.html#kells|work=Movie-locations.com|title=Barry Lyndon film locations}}</ref> [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Castle Howard]] (exteriors of the Lyndon estate), [[Huntington Castle, Clonegal]] (exterior), [[Corsham Court]] (various interiors and the music room scene), [[Petworth House]] (chapel), [[Stourhead]] (lake and temple), [[Longleat]], and [[Wilton House]] (interior and exterior) in England, [[Dunrobin Castle]] (exterior and garden as [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]]) in Scotland, [[Dublin Castle]] in Ireland (the chevalier's home), [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] near [[Stuttgart]] and [[Frederick the Great]]'s [[New Palace (Potsdam)|Neues Palais]] at [[Potsdam]] near [[Berlin]] (suggesting Berlin's main street [[Unter den Linden]] as construction in Potsdam had just begun in 1763). Some exterior shots were also filmed at [[Waterford Castle]] (now a luxury hotel and golf course) and [[Little Island, Waterford]]. [[Moorstown Castle]] in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] also featured. Several scenes were filmed at [[Castletown House]] outside [[Carrick-on-Suir]], Co. Tipperary, and at [[Youghal]], Co. Cork.\n\nThe filming took place in the backdrop of some of the most intense years of [[the Troubles]] in Ireland, during which the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (Provisional IRA) was waging an armed campaign in order to bring about a [[United Ireland]].\n\nOn 30 January 1974 while filming in Dublin City's [[Phoenix Park]] shooting had to be canceled due to the chaos caused by 14 bomb threats.<ref>https://books.google.ie/books?id=yrlPBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&dq=stanley+kubrick+ira&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjar8rJgOrcAhVFJMAKHf_pCEUQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=stanley%20kubrick%20ira&f=false</ref>\n\nOne day a phone call was received and Kubrick was given 24 hours to leave the country, he left within 12 hours.

In addition to potentially seeming more realistic, these methods also gave a particular period look to the film which has often been likened to 18th-century paintings (which were, of course, depicting a world devoid of electric lighting), in particular owing \"a lot to [[William Hogarth]], with whom Thackeray had always been fascinated.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nThe film is widely regarded as having a stately, static, painterly quality,<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> mostly due to its lengthy wide angle long shots. To illuminate the more notable interior scenes, artificial lights were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do. An example of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though it appears to be lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the main lighting of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDespite such slight tinting effects, this method of lighting not only gave the look of natural daylight coming in through the windows, but it also protected the historic locations from the damage caused by mounting the lights on walls or ceilings and the heat from the lights. This helped the film \"fit ... perfectly with Kubrick's [[wikt:gilded cage|gilded-cage]] aesthetic \u2013 the film is consciously a museum piece, its characters pinned to the frame like butterflies.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Barry Lyndon\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|1975|12|27}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = classical, march, folk\n| length     = 49:48\n| label      = Warner Bros.\n| producer   = [[Leonard Rosenman]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's period setting allowed Kubrick to indulge his penchant for classical music, and the film score uses pieces by Bach, Vivaldi, Paisiello, Mozart, and Schubert.<ref group=\"note\">The soundtrack album attributes the composition of the Hohenfriedberger March to Frederick the Great; the origin of this attribution is uncertain</ref> The piece most associated with the film, however, is the main title music, Handel's Sarabande from the Keyboard suite in D minor (HWV 437).

In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a raconteur and an [[unreliable narrator]]. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator.  Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=Visual memory | place = UK | type = interview |accessdate=2010-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210204149/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archivedate= 10 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.}}\n\nKubrick made several changes to the plot, including the addition of the final duel.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1975]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0072684|Barry Lyndon}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|barry_lyndon|Barry Lyndon}}\n* {{Screenonline title|498104|Barry Lyndon}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5047-barry-lyndon-time-regained Essay] by [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/BarryLyndon.html Screenplay of Barry Lyndon (18 February 1973)] at Daily script.\n* [http://www.indelibleinc.com/kubrick/films/blyndon/pressbook2.html ''Barry Lyndon'' Press Kit] at Indelible inc.\n* [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/ The Kubrick Site], a \"non-profit resource archive for documentary materials\", including essays and articles.\n* [http://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2011/06/test.html Stanley Kubrick\u2019s letter to projectionists on ''Barry Lyndon''] at Some Came Running.\n\n{{Stanley Kubrick}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barry Lyndon}}\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:1970s drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s war films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American war films]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Leonard Rosenman]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by William Makepeace Thackeray]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanley Kubrick]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Stanley Kubrick]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films set in Prussia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1750s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1760s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1770s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1780s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in West Sussex]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wiltshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Costume Design Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Direction BAFTA Award]]\n[[Category:Screenplays by Stanley Kubrick]]\n[[Category:Seven Years' War films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]", "sha1": "lu86l98cgl1zxx65plgbplej5bmkoca"}}, {"title": "Cell (biology)", "ns": "0", "id": "4230", "revision": {"id": "860197700", "parentid": "856423861", "timestamp": "2018-09-19T00:34:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "SrpskiAnonimac", "id": "21327649"}, "minor": "", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the term in [[biology]]|other uses|Cell (disambiguation){{!}}Cell}}\n{{Pp|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Infobox anatomy\n| Name        = Cell\n| Latin       =\n| Image       = Wilson1900Fig2.jpg\n| Caption     = [[Onion]] (''[[Allium]] cepa'') root cells in different phases of the [[cell cycle]] (drawn by [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E.

Prokaryotes are [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]], while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or [[multicellular organism|multicellular]].\n\n===Prokaryotic cells===\n{{Main|Prokaryote}}\n[[File:Average prokaryote cell- en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Structure of a typical [[prokaryotic]] cell]]\n\nProkaryotes include [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], two of the [[three domain system|three]] [[Domain (biology)|domains of life]]. Prokaryotic cells were the first form of [[life]] on Earth, characterised by having vital [[biological process]]es including [[cell signaling]]. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack membrane-bound [[organelles]] such as a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. The [[DNA]] of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single [[chromosome]] that is in direct contact with the [[cytoplasm]]. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the [[nucleoid]]. Most [[prokaryotes]] are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter.<ref>''Microbiology : Principles and Explorations'' By Jacquelyn G. Black</ref>\n\nA prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions:\n* Enclosing the cell is the [[cell envelope]] \u2013 generally consisting of a [[plasma membrane]] covered by a [[cell wall]] which, for some bacteria, may be further covered by a third layer called a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (bacteria) and ''[[Thermoplasma]]'' (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of [[peptidoglycan]] in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting ([[cytolysis]]) from [[osmotic pressure]] due to a [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment. Some eukaryotic cells ([[plant cell]]s and [[fungus|fungal]] cells) also have a cell wall.\n* Inside the cell is the [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic region]] that contains the [[genome]] (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions.<ref name=\"NCBI\">{{NCBI-scienceprimer|article=What Is a Cell?|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503014839/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html|access-date=3 May 2013}} 30 March 2004.</ref> The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry [[extrachromosomal DNA]] elements called [[plasmid]]s, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids have been identified in several species of [[spirochete]] bacteria, including members of the genus [[Borrelia]] notably ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', which causes Lyme disease.<ref>European Bioinformatics Institute, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/genomes/bacteria/Borrelia_burgdorferi.html Karyn's Genomes: Borrelia burgdorferi], part of 2can on the EBI-EMBL database. Retrieved 5 August 2012</ref> Though not forming a ''nucleus'', the [[DNA]] is condensed in a ''nucleoid''. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as [[antibiotic resistance]] genes.\n* On the outside, [[flagella]] and [[Pilus|pili]] project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells.\n[[File:Animal cell structure en.svg|thumb|Structure of a typical animal cell]]\n[[File:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|Structure of a typical [[plant cell]]]]\n\n===Eukaryotic cells===\n{{Main|Eukaryote}}\n\n[[Plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]], [[slime mould]]s, [[protozoa]], and [[algae]] are all [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]]. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is [[Cellular compartment|compartmentalization]]: the presence of membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (compartments) in which specific activities take place. Most important among these is a [[cell nucleus]],<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> an organelle that houses the cell's [[DNA]]. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means \"true kernel (nucleus)\". Other differences include:\n* The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.\n* The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called [[chromosome]]s, which are associated with [[histone]] proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the ''[[cell nucleus]]'', separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> Some eukaryotic organelles such as [[mitochondria]] also contain some DNA.\n* Many eukaryotic cells are [[cilium|ciliated]] with ''primary cilia''. Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, [[mechanosensation]], and thermosensation. Cilia may thus be \"viewed as a sensory cellular [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] that coordinates a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.\"<ref name=\"Christenson2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Satir P, Christensen ST | title = Structure and function of mammalian cilia | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 687\u201393 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18365235 | pmc = 2386530 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-008-0416-9 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/x5051hq648t3152q/ | author3 = S\u00f8ren T.

Inside the membrane, the [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell's volume. All cells (except [[red blood cell]]s which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for [[hemoglobin]]) possess [[DNA]], the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells. This article lists these primary [[cellular component]]s, then briefly describes their function.\n\n===Membrane===\n{{Main|Cell membrane}}\n[[File: Cell membrane detailed diagram en.svg|thumb|Detailed diagram of lipid bilayer cell membrane]]\nThe [[cell membrane]], or plasma membrane, is a [[biological membrane]] that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a [[cell wall]]. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a [[lipid bilayer|double layer of phospholipids]], which are [[amphiphilic]] (partly [[hydrophobic]] and partly [[hydrophilic]]). Hence, the layer is called a [[phospholipid bilayer]], or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of [[protein]] molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> The membrane is semi-permeable, and selectively permeable, in that it can either let a substance ([[molecule]] or [[ion]]) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Transmembrane receptors|receptor]] proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as [[hormone]]s.\n\n===Cytoskeleton===\n{{Main|Cytoskeleton}}\n[[File:DAPIMitoTrackerRedAlexaFluor488BPAE.jpg|thumb|A fluorescent image of an endothelial cell. Nuclei are stained blue, [[mitochondria]] are stained red, and microfilaments are stained green.]]\nThe cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during [[endocytosis]], the uptake of external materials by a cell, and [[cytokinesis]], the separation of daughter cells after [[cell division]]; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of [[microfilament]]s, [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microtubule]]s. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, [[cell polarity|polarity]] and cytokinesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michie KA, L\u00f6we J | title = Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 75 | issue =  | pages = 467\u201392 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16756499 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452 }}</ref> The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called [[actin]]. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called [[tubulin]]. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include [[vimentin]], [[desmin]], [[lamin]] (lamins A, B and C), [[keratin]] (multiple acidic and basic keratins), neurofilament proteins (NF\u2013L, NF\u2013M).\n\n===Genetic material===\nTwo different kinds of genetic material exist: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA sequence.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> RNA is used for information transport (e.g., [[mRNA]]) and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] functions (e.g., [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA). [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]].\n\nProkaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple [[circular bacterial chromosome]] in the [[nucleoid region]] of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different,<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> linear molecules called [[chromosome]]s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] (see [[endosymbiotic theory]]).\n\nA human cell has genetic material contained in the [[cell nucleus]] (the [[genome|nuclear genome]]) and in the mitochondria (the [[mitochondrial genome]]). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called [[chromosome]]s, including 22 [[homologous chromosome]] pairs and a pair of [[sex chromosomes]]. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the [[mitochondrial DNA]] is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes,<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.\n\nForeign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called [[transfection]]. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's [[genome]], or stable, if it is. Certain [[virus]]es also insert their genetic material into the genome.\n\n===Organelles===\n{{Main|Organelle}}\nOrganelles are parts of the cell which are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function).<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound.\n\nThere are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[golgi apparatus]]) are typically solitary, while others (such as [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[peroxisomes]] and [[lysosomes]]) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The [[cytosol]] is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.\n\n====Eukaryotic====\n[[File:HeLa Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|Human cancer cells, specifically [[HeLa cells]], with DNA stained blue. The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], so their DNA is diffuse and the entire nuclei are labelled. The cell on the left is going through [[mitosis]] and its chromosomes have condensed.]]\n* '''Cell nucleus''': A cell's information center, the [[cell nucleus]] is the most conspicuous organelle found in a [[eukaryotic]] cell. It houses the cell's [[chromosomes]], and is the place where almost all [[DNA]] replication and [[RNA]] synthesis ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the [[nuclear envelope]]. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]], or copied into a special [[RNA]], called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The [[nucleolus]] is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"NCBI\"/>\n* '''Mitochondria and Chloroplasts''': generate energy for the cell. [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> [[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] occurs in the cell mitochondria, which generate the cell's energy by [[oxidative phosphorylation]], using [[oxygen]] to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to [[glucose]]) to generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Mitochondria multiply by [[binary fission]], like prokaryotes. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make carbohydrates through [[photosynthesis]].\n\n[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en.svg|thumb|Diagram of the [[endomembrane system]]]]\n* '''Endoplasmic reticulum''': The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is a transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface that secrete proteins into the ER, and the smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> The smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release.\n* '''Golgi apparatus''': The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s that are synthesized by the cell.\n* '''Lysosomes and Peroxisomes''': [[Lysosome]]s contain [[digestive enzyme]]s (acid [[hydrolase]]s). They digest excess or worn-out [[organelle]]s, food particles, and engulfed [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]]. [[Peroxisome]]s have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic [[peroxide]]s. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/>\n* '''Centrosome''': the cytoskeleton organiser: The [[centrosome]] produces the [[microtubules]] of a cell \u2013 a key component of the [[cytoskeleton]]. It directs the transport through the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Centrosomes are composed of two [[centrioles]], which separate during [[cell division]] and help in the formation of the [[mitotic spindle]]. A single centrosome is present in the [[animal cell]]s. They are also found in some fungi and algae cells.\n* '''Vacuoles''': [[Vacuole]]s sequester waste products and in plant cells store water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably ''[[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]'', have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of plant cells and fungal cells are usually larger than those of animal cells.\n\n====Eukaryotic and prokaryotic====\n* '''Ribosomes''': The [[ribosome]] is a large complex of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e9n\u00e9tret JF, Schaletzky J, Clemons WM, Osborne AR, Sk\u00e5nland SS, Denison C, Gygi SP, Kirkpatrick DS, Park E, Ludtke SJ, Rapoport TA, Akey CW | title = Ribosome binding of a single copy of the SecY complex: implications for protein translocation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1083\u201392 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18158904 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.034 }}</ref>\n\n==Structures outside the cell membrane==\nMany cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable cell membrane]]. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.\n\n===Cell wall===\nMany types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a [[cell wall]]. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of cellulose, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.\n\n===Prokaryotic===\n\n====Capsule====\nA gelatinous [[bacterial capsule|capsule]] is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be [[polysaccharide]] as in [[pneumococci]], [[meningococci]] or [[polypeptide]] as ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' or [[hyaluronic acid]] as in [[streptococci]].\nCapsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by [[India ink#Uses other than writing|India ink]] or [[methyl blue]]; which allows for higher contrast between the cells for observation.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2GU-DYKkk0C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=Prokaryotic+india+ink#v=onepage&q=india%20ink&f=false | title=Prokaryotes | publisher=Newnes | year=Apr 11, 1996 | isbn=9780080984735}}</ref>{{rp|87}}\n\n====Flagella====\n[[Flagella]] are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of flagellum is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.\n\n====Fimbria====\nA [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbria]] also known as a [[pilus]] is a short, thin, hair-like filament found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae, or pili are formed of a protein called [[pilin]] ([[antigenic]]) and are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell ([[cell adhesion]]). There are special types of specific pili involved in [[bacterial conjugation]].\n\n==Cellular processes==\n[[File:Three cell growth types.svg|thumb|[[Prokaryotes]] divide by [[binary fission]], while [[eukaryotes]] divide by [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].]]\n===Replication===\n{{Main|Cell division}}\nCell division involves a single cell (called a ''mother cell'') dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in [[multicellular organism]]s (the growth of [[biological tissue|tissue]]) and to procreation ([[vegetative reproduction]]) in [[unicellular organism]]s. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells divide by [[binary fission]], while [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called [[mitosis]], followed by division of the cell, called [[cytokinesis]]. A [[diploid]] cell may also undergo [[meiosis]] to produce haploid cells, usually four. [[Haploid]] cells serve as [[gamete]]s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.\n\n[[DNA replication]], or the process of duplicating a cell's genome,<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the [[cell cycle]].\n\nIn meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before [[meiosis I]]. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in [[meiosis II]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Campbell Biology\u2014Concepts and Connections|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|page=138}}</ref> Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.<ref name=\"NCBI\"/>\n[[File:Catabolism schematic.svg|thumb|left|An outline of the [[catabolism]] of [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s]]\n\n===Growth and metabolism===\n[[File:Proteinsynthesis.png|thumb|An overview of protein synthesis.<br />Within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the cell (''light blue''), [[gene]]s (DNA, ''dark blue'') are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature [[mRNA]] (''red'') that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the [[cytoplasm]] (''peach''), where it undergoes [[translation (genetics)|translation]] into a protein. mRNA is translated by [[ribosome]]s (''purple'') that match the three-base [[codon]]s of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate [[transfer RNA|tRNA]]. Newly synthesized proteins (''black'') are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule (''orange''), to become fully active.]]\n{{Main|Cell growth|Metabolism}}\nBetween successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: [[catabolism]], in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and [[Reducing agent|reducing power]], and [[anabolism]], in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.\nComplex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into simpler sugar molecules called [[monosaccharides]] such as [[glucose]]. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]),<ref name=\"NCBI\"/> a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.\n\n===Protein synthesis===\n{{Main|Protein biosynthesis}}\nCells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].\n\nTranscription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s located in the [[cytosol]], where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.\n\n===Motility===\n{{Main|Motility}}\nUnicellular organisms can move in order to find food or escape predators. Common mechanisms of motion include [[flagella]] and [[cilia]].\n\nIn multicellular organisms, cells can move during processes such as wound healing, the immune response and [[cancer metastasis]]. For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.<ref>{{cite web| first1 = Revathi | last1 = Ananthakrishnan | first2 = Allen | last2 = Ehrlicher | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.biolsci.org/v03p0303.htm |title=The Forces Behind Cell Movement |publisher=Biolsci.org |access-date=2009-04-17}}</ref> The process is divided into three steps \u2013 protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward.

Cell types differ both in appearance and function, yet are [[Genetics|genetically]] identical. Cells are able to be of the same [[genotype]] but of different cell type due to the differential [[Regulation of gene expression|expression]] of the [[gene]]s they contain.\n\nMost distinct cell types arise from a single [[totipotent]] cell, called a [[zygote]], that [[Cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into hundreds of different cell types during the course of [[Development (biology)|development]].

While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself [[Minor characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer#Merrick|Merrick]] ([[Donald Sutherland]]). He informs her that she is [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|The Slayer]], or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]] whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rejects his claim but is convinced that he's right when he's able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying, and sharp-tongued remarks.\n\nAfter several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos ([[Rutger Hauer]]), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn ([[Paul Reubens]]). Two young men, [[Pike (Buffyverse character)|Oliver Pike]] ([[Luke Perry]]) and Benny ([[David Arquette]]), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they're attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned, but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him.\n\nAmilyn also abducts Cassandra, a studious girl from Buffy's class, to sacrifice to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through L.A. and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.\n\nWhen Pike realizes there's something wrong with Benny and that he's no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his gang of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn flees the fight to talk to Lothos. After this encounter, Buffy and Pike start a friendship that eventually becomes romantic, and Pike becomes Buffy's partner in fighting the undead.\n\nDuring a basketball game, Buffy discovers that one of the players, and a friend of Jeffrey's, is a vampire. After a quick chase to a parade float storage yard, Buffy confronts Lothos, shortly after she and Pike take down his gang. Lothos puts Buffy into a trance, which is broken due to Merrick's intervention. Lothos stabs Merrick with the stake he attempted to use on him. Lothos leaves, saying Buffy is not ready. As Merrick dies, he tells Buffy to do things her own way rather than live by the rules of others and gives her one final clue: \"Remember about the music.\"\n\nBecause of her new life, its responsibilities, and the heartbreak of losing her Watcher, Buffy, emotionally shocked, starts neglecting her Slayer duties. When she arrives at school, she attempts to explain things to her friends, but they refuse to understand her as they are more concerned with an upcoming school dance. Buffy falls out with them as she realizes she has outgrown their immature, selfish behavior.\n\nAt the senior dance, Buffy tries to patch things up with her friends, but they freeze her out. She's dismayed to find Jeffrey has dumped her for one of her friends. However, she meets up with Pike, and as they start to dance and kiss, Lothos sends his remaining minions to the school to attack the humans at the dance. \n\nBuffy confronts the vampires outside, while inside the gym Pike fights and kills the vampiric Benny. After overpowering the newly made vampires, she confronts Lothos inside the school and (possibly) kills Amilyn. Lothos attempts to ensorcel Buffy again, but when the dance music stops, she remembers Merrick's words and defends herself.\n\nShe first tries to repel Lothos with a cross, but the vampire king is unimpressed. He grabs the cross, setting it afire, but Buffy uses her hair spray as a makeshift flame-thrower and burns him before escaping to the gym. Buffy sees her classmates recovering from the vampire attack, but Lothos bursts into the gym, promising to split Buffy open like a piece of rotten fruit. The Slayer and vampire duel, a wooden flagpole versus a [[katana]]. In the end, Buffy stakes Lothos and kills him.\n\nAs the survivors leave, Buffy and Pike decide to finish their dance. The film ends with the two of them leaving the dance on a motorcycle. A skeptical news crew headed up by [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] interviews the students and the principal about the attack during the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as [[Buffy Summers]]\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Pike (Buffyverse character)|Oliver Pike]]\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Lothos\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Minor characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer#Merrick|Merrick Jamison-Smythe]]\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Amilyn/Lefty\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Kimberly Hannah\n* [[David Arquette]] as Benny Jacks\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Gary Murray\n* Paris Vaughan as Nicole \"Nicki\"\n* [[Natasha Gregson Wagner]] as Cassandra\n* [[Thomas Jane|Tom Jane]] as Zeph\n* [[Candy Clark]] as [[Joyce Summers|Buffy's Mom]]<!-- this character is not credited as Joyce Summers, who was created for the TV series -->\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Jeffrey Kramer\n* [[Sasha Jenson]] as Grueller\n* [[Ben Affleck]] (''uncredited'') as Basketball Player #10\n* [[Ricki Lake]] (''uncredited'') as Charlotte\n* [[Seth Green]] (''uncredited'') as a vampire\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as vampire DJ\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Continuity with the television show==\nMany of the details given in the film differ from the [[Buffyverse canon|those of the later television series]]. For example, Buffy's age and history are dissimilar; she's a senior in high school in the film, but the series starts with her as a sophomore. The film does portray who the Buffy of the TV series was before she learned of her destiny as the Slayer: a popular but selfish and superficial cheerleader. In the film, her parents are wealthy but negligent socialites who care little for her and spend their time at parties and golf tournaments; in the TV show, Buffy has a caring, newly divorced mother named [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]].\n\nThe supernatural abilities of both vampires and the Slayer are depicted differently. The vampires in the film die like humans; in the TV show, they turn to dust. Unlike the TV show, their faces remain human albeit pale, fanged, and with notched ears, whereas in the series, they take on a demonic aspect, especially when newly raised. The series suggests that new vampires must consciously learn to maintain a human appearance.\n\nIn the film, Merrick is hundreds of years old, having lived many lives training many Slayers; in the series, Watchers are mortal and specially trained for their role and mission. Merrick's British accent and the manner of his death are different when he appears in flashbacks in the series.\n\nJoss Whedon has expressed his disapproval with the movie's interpretation of the script,<ref>[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 Bronze VIP Archive - January 17, 1999<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220181357/http://www.cise.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hsiao/buffy/get-archive?date=19990117 |date=December 20, 2014 }}</ref> stating \"I finally sat down and had written it and somebody had made it into a movie, and I felt like &mdash; well, that's not quite her.

In 1999, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a graphic novel adaptation of Whedon's original script under the title ''[[The Origin (Buffy comic)|The Origin]]''. Whedon stated: \"The ''Origin'' comic, though I have issues with it, CAN pretty much be accepted as canonical.

He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the \"double coincidence of wants\" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.<ref name=\"Graeber-p21-41\" />\n\nBarter is characterized in Adam Smith's \"''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''\" by a disparaging vocabulary: \"higgling, haggling, swapping, dickering.\" It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or \"selfish profiteering.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologists have argued, in contrast, \"that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}</ref> Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state.

[[Olaus Magnus]], 1555]]\nOther anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between \"total\" strangers, a form of barter known as \"silent trade\". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (\"dumb\" here used in its old meaning of \"mute\"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through \"silent trade\" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. \"Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}</ref>\n\nIn his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the [[Trobriand Islands]], Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is \"an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society\" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.<ref>{{cite book|last=M. Bloch|first=J. Parry|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Times of monetary crisis===\n\nAs Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}</ref>\n\nAn example of this would be during the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], when Venezuelans resorted to bartering as a result of hyperinflation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-barter/fish-for-flour-barter-is-the-new-currency-in-collapsing-venezuela-idUSKBN1JT1UM?il=0|title=Fish for flour?

All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trade and Market in Early Empires|year=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, Illinois|page=14|author=Polanyi, Karl|authorlink=Marketless Trading in Hammurabi's Time|editor=Polanyi, Karl|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhile one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.\n\nModern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits \u2013 they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, retailers began to abandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures, for both the aristocracy and the middle classes.<ref>Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Utopian socialism ====\n{{Main article|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]]. Scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' by [[Josiah Warren]] (1846)]]\n\nThe Owenite socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a \"theory of equitable exchange\" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed \"schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=72}}</ref> This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an [[I.O.U.|IOU]] circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.\n\nAn alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=73}}</ref>\n\nIn England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an \"exchange bazaar\" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note. The British Association for Promoting Cooperative Knowledge established an \"equitable labour exchange\" in 1830. This was expanded as the National Equitable Labour Exchange in 1832 on Grays Inn Road in London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|pages=202\u20134}}</ref> These efforts became the basis of the British cooperative movement of the 1840s. In 1848, the [[socialist]] and first self-designated [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] postulated a system of ''time chits''.

There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local [[barter exchange]]. There are two industry groups in the United States, the [http://www.natebarter.com National Association of Trade Exchanges] (NATE) and the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade.

Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a \"trade-credit\".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the \"client\" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSoviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called \"barter trade\", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international [[clearing account]], avoiding the use of hard cash.\n\n==Tax implications==\nIn the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]]. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an [[op-ed]] for ''The New York Times'' in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |title=We Won\u2019t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=437\u2013440}}</ref> However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]]. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, \"The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOther countries, though, do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nSince the 1830s, barter in some [[western world | western]] [[market economies]] has been aided by exchanges which use alternative currencies based on the [[labour theory of value]], and which are intended to prevent [[profit taking | profit-taking]] by [[intermediary | intermediaries]].

Her first teacher, Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne, taught her the basics of drawing. After several months, Morisot began to take classes taught by Joseph Guichard. During this period, she found her talents in drawing and drew mostly ancient classical figures. When Morisot expressed her interests in [[En plein air|plein-air]] painting, Guichard sent her to follow [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] and Achille Oudinot. Painting outdoor, she played with the light and time with the use of watercolors which are easy to carry. At that time, Morisot also became interested in pastel. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830199379|title=Berthe Morisot : 1841-1895|others=Mathieu, Marianne., Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.|isbn=9780300182019|location=Paris|oclc=830199379}}</ref>\n\n=== Watercolorist, 1870-1874 ===\nDuring this period, she practiced watercolors for most of the time. Her choice of colors is rather restrained; however, the delicate repetition of hues renders a balanced effect. Due to specific characteristics of watercolors as a medium, Morisot was able to create a translucent atmosphere and feathery touch, which contribute to the freshness in her paintings. In fact, between 1870-1873, Morisot still found oil painting difficult and she could only apply her watercolor works to the oil paintings. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830199379|title=Berthe Morisot : 1841-1895|others=Mathieu, Marianne., Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.|isbn=9780300182019|location=Paris|oclc=830199379}}</ref>\n\n=== Impressionism, 1875\u20131885 ===\nDuring this time, Morisot felt more confident about oil painting, and she would paint in oil, watercolor and pastel at the same time, as Degas did. Morisot painted very quickly but she also prepared a lot in advance. Firstly, she made countless studies of her subject matter. Her subjects were repeatedly drawn from her life so she became quite familiar with them. Morisot did much sketching as preparation, so she could paint \"a mouth, eyes, and a nose with a single brushstroke.\" Secondly, when it became inconvenient to paint outdoors, the very highly finished watercolors done in the preparatory stages allowed her to continue painting indoors later.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830199379|title=Berthe Morisot : 1841-1895|others=Mathieu, Marianne., Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.|isbn=9780300182019|location=Paris|oclc=830199379}}</ref>\n\n=== Turning, 1885-1887 ===\nSince 1885, drawing began to dominate in Morisot's works. Morisot actively experimented with charcoals and color pencils. What seems paradoxical is that her reviving interest in drawing was motivated by her Impressionist friends, who are known for blurring forms. Morisot put her emphasis on the clarification of the form and lines during this period. In addition, she was under the influence of developing technology of photography and [[Japonism|Japonisme]], shown in her composition without a clear center. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830199379|title=Berthe Morisot : 1841-1895|others=Mathieu, Marianne., Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.|isbn=9780300182019|location=Paris|oclc=830199379}}</ref>\n\n=== New Painting Way, 1887-1895 ===\nMorisot started to use the technique of squaring and the medium of tracing paper to transcribe her drawing to the canvas exactly. By employing this new method, Morisot was able to create brand-new types of compositions where more complicated interaction between figures in the paintings and the numerous adjustments emerged. She stressed the composition and the forms while her impressionist brushstrokes still remained. Her original synthesis of the impressionist touch with broad strokes and light reflections and the graphic approach featured by clear lines made her late works really distinctive.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830199379|title=Berthe Morisot : 1841-1895|others=Mathieu, Marianne., Mus\u00e9e Marmottan.|isbn=9780300182019|location=Paris|oclc=830199379}}</ref>\n\n== Style and Technique ==\nMorisot's paintings are commented as full of \"feminine charm\", which features elegance and lightness. Her brushstrokes are as light as the touch of a petal; therefore, French critics often use the verb \"effleurer\" (to touch lightly, brush against) to describe her technique. In her early life, Morisot painted in open air as other Impressionists to look for truths in observation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646401344|title=Berthe Morisot|last=Dominique.|first=Rey, Jean|date=2010|publisher=Flammarion|others=Patry, Sylvie., Morisot, Berthe, 1841-1895., Lalaurie, Louise Rogers.|isbn=9782080301680|location=Paris|oclc=646401344}}</ref> Around 1880 she began painting on unprimed canvases\u2014a technique Manet and [[Eva Gonzal\u00e8s]] also experimented with at the time<ref>[http://nmwa.org/works/cage National Museum of Women in the Arts: \"The Cage\"], retrieved November 24, 2014.</ref>\u2014and her brushwork became looser. In 1888\u201389, her brushstrokes transitioned from short, rapid strokes to long, sinuous ones that define form.<ref>{{cite book|title=Berthe Morisot, Drawings Pastels, Watercolors|last1=Mongan|first1=Elizabeth|date=1960|publisher=Shorewood Publishing Co.|location=New York|page=20}}</ref> The outer edges of her paintings were often left unfinished, allowing the canvas to show through and increasing the sense of spontaneity.

Morisot\u2019s works are almost always small in scale.\n\nMorisot creates a sense of space and depth through the use of color. Although her color palette was somehow limited, her fellow impressionists regarded her as a \"virtuoso colorist\".<ref name=\"Charles F., William P.\" /> She typically made expansive use of white to create a sense of transparency, whether used as a pure white or mixed with other colors. In her large painting, ''The Cherry Tree'', colors are more vivid but are still used to emphasize form.<ref name=\"Charles F., William P.\" />\n\nFurthermore, it is no wonder that the style and techniques that Morisot applied were greatly inspired by her Impressionist friends. Inspired by Manet's drawings, she kept the use of colors to the minimum when constructing a motif. Responding to the experiments conducted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]], Morisot used barely tinted whites to harmonize the paintings. Like Degas, she played with three media simultaneously in one painting: watercolor, pastel, and oil paints.

Founded in 1889 by [[Annie Nathan Meyer]], who named it after [[Columbia University]]'s 10th president, [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|Frederick Barnard]], it is one of the [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States|oldest women's colleges]] in the world. The acceptance rate for the Barnard Class of 2022 was 13.7%, the lowest in the school's history.\n\nThe college was founded as a response to Columbia's refusal to admit women into their institution. Since 1900, Barnard has been [[Affiliated school|affiliated]] with Columbia University. However, Barnard is financially separate from the university. Barnard offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree programs in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at greater Columbia University, the [[Juilliard School]], and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|The Jewish Theological Seminary]], which are also based in New York City.\n\nBarnard students share some classes, clubs, [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]], sports teams, buildings and more with Columbia University. Barnard graduates receive Columbia University diplomas that are signed both by Barnard and Columbia presidents.

They are also sometimes called the '''Black Monks''', in reference to the colour of its members' [[religious habit]]s.\n\nDespite being called an order, the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of independent [[Cenobium|monastic communities]], with each community ([[monastery]], [[priory]] or [[abbey]]) within the order maintaining its own autonomy. Unlike other religious orders, the Benedictines do not have a [[superior general]] or [[motherhouse]] with universal jurisdiction. Instead, the order is represented internationally by the [[Benedictine Confederation]], an organisation that was set up in 1893 to represent the order's shared interests.\n\n==Historical development==\n{{Main|Benedict of Nursia}}\n[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Benedict of Nursia (c.&nbsp;480\u2013543). Detail from a [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]] (c.&nbsp;1400\u20131455) in the [[San Marco, Florence|Friary of San Marco]] [[Florence]].]]\n\nThe monastery at [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] in Italy, established by [[Saint Benedict of Nursia]] {{circa}} 529, was the first of the dozen monasteries he founded. He later founded the [[Abbey of Monte Cassino]]. There is no evidence, however, that he intended to found an order and the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] presupposes the autonomy of each community. When Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome, and it seems probable that this constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=The Benedictine Order|inline=yes|last=Alston|first=Cyprian|volume=2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02443a.htm}}</ref>\n\nIt was from the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome that [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the prior, and his forty companions set forth in 595 on their mission for the evangelization of England. At various stopping places during the journey, the monks left behind them traditions concerning their rule and form of life, and probably also some copies of the Rule. [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]], for instance, founded by [[Honoratus]] in 375, probably received its first knowledge of the Benedictine Rule from the visit of St. Augustine and his companions in 596.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Gregory of Tours]] says that at [[Basilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay#Ainay Abbey|Ainay Abbey]], in the sixth century, the monks \"followed the rules of Basil, Cassian, Caesarius, and other fathers, taking and using whatever seemed proper to the conditions of time and place\", and doubtless the same liberty was taken with the Benedictine Rule when it reached them. In Gaul and Switzerland, it supplemented the much stricter Irish or Celtic Rule introduced by [[Columbanus]] and others. In many monasteries it eventually entirely displaced the earlier codes.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[File:Benedikt von Aniane.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benedict of Aniane]] (747\u2013821).]]\nBy the ninth century, however, the Benedictine had become the standard form of monastic life throughout the whole of Western Europe, excepting Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, where the Celtic observance still prevailed for another century or two.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Largely through the work of [[Benedict of Aniane]], it became the rule of choice for monasteries throughout the Carolingian empire.<ref name=Theisen>{{cite web|url=http://www.osb.org/gen/benedictines.html|title=The Benedictines: An Introduction by Abbot Primate Jerome Theisen OSB. Liturgical Press.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMonastic scriptoria flourished from the ninth through the twelfth centuries. Sacred Scripture was always at the heart of every monastic scriptorium. As a general rule those of the monks who possessed skill as writers made this their chief, if not their sole active work. An anonymous writer of the ninth or tenth century speaks of six hours a day as the usual task of a scribe, which would absorb almost all the time available for active work in the day of a medieval monk.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13635a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. \"Scriptorium.\"] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 11 February 2015</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages monasteries were often founded by the nobility. [[Cluny Abbey]] was founded by [[William I, Duke of Aquitaine]] in 910. The abbey was noted for its strict adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict. The abbot of Cluny was the superior of all the daughter houses, through appointed priors.<ref name=Theisen/>\n\nOne of the earliest reforms of Benedictine practice was that initiated in 980 by [[Romuald]], who founded the [[Camaldolese]] community.\n\nThe dominance of the Benedictine monastic way of life began to decline towards the end of the twelfth century, which saw the rise of the Franciscans and Dominicans.<ref name=Theisen/> Benedictines took a fourth vow of \"stability\", which professed loyalty to a particular foundation. Not being bound by location, the mendicants were better able to respond to an increasingly \"urban\" environment. This decline was further exacerbated by the practice of appointing a commendatory abbot, a lay person, appointed by a noble to oversee and to protect the goods of the monastery. Oftentimes, however, this resulted in the appropriation of the assets of monasteries at the expense of the community which they were intended to support. \n\n===England===\nThe English Benedictine Congregation is the oldest of the nineteen Benedictine congregations. Augustine of Canterbury and his monks established the first English Benedictine monastery at Canterbury soon after their arrival in 597. Other foundations quickly followed. Through the influence of [[Wilfrid]], [[Benedict Biscop]], and [[Dunstan]], the Benedictine Rule spread with extraordinary rapidity, and in the North it was adopted in most of the monasteries that had been founded by the Celtic missionaries from Iona. Many of the episcopal sees of England were founded and governed by the Benedictines, and no fewer than nine of the old cathedrals were served by the black monks of the priories attached to them.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Monasteries served as hospitals and places of refuge for the weak and homeless. The monks studied the healing properties of plants and minerals to alleviate the sufferings of the sick.<ref name=Hicks>{{cite web|url=http://www.osb.org/gen/hicks/index.html|title=Dom Bruno Hicks OSB.  The Benedictines (frames).|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nGermany was evangelized by English Benedictines. [[Willibrord]] and [[Boniface]] preached there in the seventh and eighth centuries and founded several abbeys.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n \nIn the [[English Reformation]], all [[Dissolution of the monasteries|monasteries were dissolved]] and their lands confiscated by the Crown, forcing their [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] members to flee into exile on the Continent. During the 19th century they were able to return to England, including to [[Selby Abbey]] in [[Yorkshire]], one of the few great monastic churches to survive the Dissolution.\n[[File:Saint Benedict Medal.jpg|thumb|The two sides of a ''Saint Benedict Medal'']]\n\n[[Minster-in-Thanet|St. Mildred's Priory]], on the [[Isle of Thanet]], [[Kent]], was built in 1027 on the site of an abbey founded in 670 by the daughter of the first Christian [[King of Kent]]. Currently the priory is home to a community of Benedictine nuns. Five of the most notable English abbeys are the Basilica of St Gregory the Great at Downside, commonly known as [[Downside Abbey]], The Abbey of St Edmund, King and Martyr commonly known as [[Douai Abbey]] in Upper Woolhampton, Reading, Berkshire, [[Ealing Abbey]] in Ealing, West London, and [[Worth Abbey]].<ref>Colin Battell, OSB, \"Spirituality on the beach,\" ''The Tablet'' 2 December 2006, 18-19.

Monks would read privately during their personal time, as well as publicly during services and at meal times. In addition to these three mentioned in the Rule, monks would also read in the infirmary.\n\nHowever, Benedictine monks were disallowed worldly possessions, thus necessitating the preservation and collection of sacred texts in monastic libraries for communal use.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wormald and Wright|first= Francis and C.E.|date= 1958|title= The English Library before 1700|location= University of London|publisher= The Athlone Press|page= 15}}</ref> For the sake of convenience, the books in the monastery were housed in a few different places, namely the [[sacristy]], which contained books for the choir and other liturgical books, the [[rectory]], which housed books for public reading such as sermons and lives of the saints, and the [[library]], which contained the largest collection of books and was typically in the cloister.\n\nThe first record of a monastic library in England is in [[Canterbury]]. To assist with [[Augustine of Canterbury]]'s [[Gregorian mission|English mission]], Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] gave him nine books which included the Gregorian Bible in two volumes, the Psalter of Augustine, two copies of the [[Gospels]], two [[martyrologies]], an Exposition of the Gospels and Epistles, and a [[Psalter]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Savage|first= Ernest|date= 1912|title= Old English Libraries|location= London|publisher= Methuen & Co.

Monasteries were again allowed to form in the 19th century under the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Later that century, under the [[Third French Republic]], laws were enacted preventing religious teaching. The original intent was to allow secular schools. Thus in 1880 and 1882, Benedictine teaching monks were effectively exiled; this was not completed until 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-benoit-du-lac.com/histoire1/history1.html|title=Historique I|publisher=st-benoit-du-lac.com|accessdate=29 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk1KzHS1IagC&pg=PA495&lpg=PA495&dq=-wikipedia+benedictines+expelled+from+france+1901&source=web&ots=7RydgvaUmY&sig=e6nAEj6HiM6GS-WrGt1w1Fp3dpI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|title=A History of the Popes, 1830-1914|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ryde.shalfleet.net/wootton_and_quarr.htm Wootton and Fishbourne].

It also had significant influence on the abbeys of Alpirsbach (1099), Ettenheimm\u00fcnster (1124) and Sulzburg (ca 1125), and the priories of Weitenau (ca 1100), B\u00fcrgeln (before 1130) and Sitzenkirch (ca 1130).\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe abbey of [[Engelberg Abbey|Our Lady of the Angels]] was founded in 1120. \n\n=== United States ===\nThe first Benedictine to live in the United States was Pierre-Joseph Didier. He came to the United States in 1790 from [[Paris]] and served in the Ohio and St. Louis areas until his death. The first actual Benedictine monastery founded was [[Saint Vincent Archabbey]], located in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1832 by [[Boniface Wimmer|Bonifice Wimmer]], a German monk, who sought to serve German immigrants in America. In 1856, Wimmer started to lay the foundations for [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|St. John's Abbey]] in Minnesota. In 1876, Father Herman Wolfe, of Saint Vincent Archabbey established [[Belmont Abbey, North Carolina|Belmont Abbey]] in North Carolina.<ref>[http://belmontabbey.org/learn-about-the-monastery/history-of-belmont-abbey/ \"History of Belmont Abbey\", Belmont Abbey, North Carolina]</ref> By the time of his death in 1887, Wimmer had sent Benedictine monks to Kansas, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, and Colorado.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = RB 1980|last = Fry|first = Timothy|publisher = The Liturgical Press|year = 1981|isbn = 0-8146-1211-3|location = Collegeville, Minnesota|pages = 136\u2013141}}</ref>\n\nWimmer also asked for Benedictine [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s to be sent to America by St. Walburg Convent in [[Eichst\u00e4tt]], Bavaria.

For instance the American-Cassinese congregation included the 22 monasteries that descended from Boniface Wimmer.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Benedictine Congregations and Federations of North America in the Benedictine Confederation.|url = http://www.osb.org/intl/confed/nacong.html|website = www.osb.org|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Benedictine vow and life==\n{{Main|Rule of Saint Benedict}}\n[[File:BenedictineVespers.jpg|thumb|left|Benedictine [[monk]]s singing [[Vespers]] on [[Holy Saturday]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], U.S.]]\nThe sense of community was a defining characteristic of the order since the beginning.<ref>[https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/history/benedictine-order/history \"The Defining Features of the Benedictine Order\", Durham World Heritage Site]</ref>\nSection 17 in chapter 58 of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] states the solemn promise candidates for reception into a Benedictine community are required to make: a promise of stability (i.e. to remain in the same community), ''conversatio morum'' (an idiomatic Latin phrase suggesting \"conversion of manners\"; see below) and obedience to the community's superior.<ref>[http://www.saintjohnsabbey.org/monastic-life/order/ \"The Order of Saint Benedict\", St. John's Abbey]</ref> This solemn commitment tends to be referred to as the \"Benedictine vow\" and is the Benedictine antecedent and equivalent of the [[evangelical counsels]] professed by candidates for reception into a [[religious order]].\n\nMuch scholarship over the last fifty years has been dedicated to the translation and interpretation of \"''conversatio morum''\".  The older translation \"conversion of life\" has generally been replaced with phrases such as \"[conversion to] a monastic manner of life\", drawing from the Vulgate's use of ''conversatio'' as a translation of \"citizenship\" or \"homeland\" in Philippians 3:20.  Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as \"to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot.\"\n\nBenedictine [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es have full jurisdiction of their [[abbey]] and thus absolute authority over the [[Roman Catholic monk|monk]]s or [[nun]]s who are resident.  This authority includes the power to assign duties, to decide which books may or may not be read, to regulate comings and goings, and to punish and to [[excommunicate]], in the sense of an enforced isolation from the monastic community.\n\nA tight communal timetable{{spaced ndash}}the [[horarium]]{{spaced ndash}}is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but used in God's service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading or sleep.\n\nAlthough Benedictines do not take a vow of silence, hours of strict silence are set, and at other times silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like the many other details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its 'customary'. A ' customary' is the code adopted by a particular Benedictine house, adapting the Rule to local conditions.<ref>http://www.mountmichael.org/Media/MountMichaelAbbey/Abbey/CUSTOMARY.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, according to the norms of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]], a Benedictine abbey is a \"[[religious institute]]\" and its members are therefore members of the [[consecrated life]]<!--?: , commonly referred to as \"Religious\"-->. While Canon Law 588 \u00a71 explains that Benedictine monks are \"neither clerical nor lay\", they can, however, be ordained. \n\nSome monasteries adopt a more active ministry in living the monastic life, running schools or parishes; others are more focused on contemplation, with more of an emphasis on prayer and work within the confines of the cloister.\n\n==Organization==\nBenedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with \"Generalates\" and \"Superiors General\". Each Benedictine house is independent and governed by an Abbot.\n\nIn modern times, the various groups of autonomous houses (national, reform, etc.) have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines). There are twenty Congregations within the [[Benedictine Confederation]]. These, in turn, are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]] that came into existence through [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Apostolic Brief \"Summum semper\" on 12 July 1893.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Benedictine Confederation |url=http://www.osb.org/the-benedictine-order/the-benedictine-confederation/ |website=OSB.org |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other [[religious order]]s and the church at large.

The community adopted the Rule of St. Benedict and received canonical approval in 1344. The Olivetans are part of the Benedictine Confederation.\n\n==Other orders==\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict is also used by a number of religious orders that began as reforms of the Benedictine tradition such as the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Trappist]]s. These groups are separate congregations and not members of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].\n\nAlthough Benedictines traditionally refer to Catholics, there are also some within the [[Anglican Communion]] and occasionally within other Christian denominations as well, for example, within the [[Lutheran Church]], that claim adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict.

He was an impetuous soldier, earning the nickname Lightning in a battle against the [[Karamanids]].\n \nBayezid ascended to the throne following the death of his father Murad I, who was killed by Serbian knight [[Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107]] during (28 June),the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, by which Serbia became a vassal of the Ottoman Sultanate. Immediately after obtaining the throne, he had his younger brother strangled to avoid a plot. In 1390, Bayezid took as a wife Princess [[Olivera Despina]], the daughter of Prince [[Lazar of Serbia]],<ref>Halil Inalcik, \"Bayezid I\", ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, Ed. H.A.R. Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 1118.</ref> who also lost his life in Kosovo. Bayezid recognized [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]], the son of Lazar, as the new Serbian leader (later despot), with considerable autonomy.\n[[File:Qur'anic Manuscript - Mid to Late 15th Century, Turkey.jpg|thumb|130px|A manuscript of the [[Quran]] from the reign of Bayezid I.]]\nThe upper Serbia resisted the Ottomans until general Pashayigit captured the city of Skopje in 1391, converting the city to an important base of operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the sultan began unifying Anatolia under his rule. Forcible expansion into Muslim territories could endanger the Ottoman relationship with the [[gazi]]s, who were an importance        source of warriors for this ruling house on the European frontier. So Bayezid began the practice to first secure ''fatwa''s, or legal rulings from Islamic scholars, justifying their wars against these Muslim states. However he suspected the loyalty of his Muslim Turkoman followers, for Bayezid relied heavily on his Serbian and Byzantine vassal troops to perform these conquests.<ref>Stanford Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), vol. 1 p. 30</ref>\n\nIn a single campaign over the summer and fall of 1390, Bayezid conquered the beyliks of [[Beylik of Ayd\u0131n|Aydin]], [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] and [[Menteshe]]. His major rival Sulayman, the emir of [[Karaman]], responded by allying himself with the ruler of [[Sivas]], [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] and the remaining Turkish beyliks. Nevertheless, Bayezid pushed on and in the fall and winter of 1390 overwhelmed the remaining beyliks -- [[Hamidids|Hamid]], [[Beylik of Teke|Teke]], and [[Germiyan]]\u2014as well as taking the cities of [[Ak\u015fehir]] and [[Ni\u011fde]], as well as their capital [[Konya]] from the Karaman. At this point, Bayezid accepted peace proposals from Karaman (1391), concerned that further advances would antagonize his Turkoman followers and lead them to ally with Kadi Burhan al-Din. Once peace had been made with Karaman, Bayezid moved north against [[Kastamonu]] which had given refuge to many fleeing from his forces, and conquered both that city as well as [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire'', vol. 1 pp. 30f</ref> However, his subsequent campaign was stopped by Burhan al-Din at the [[Battle of K\u0131rkdilim]].\n\nFrom 1389 to 1395 he conquered [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Greece]]. In 1394 Bayezid crossed the River [[Danube]] to attack [[Wallachia]], ruled at that time by [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]]. The Ottomans were superior in number, but on 10 October 1394 (or 17 May 1395), in the [[Battle of Rovine]], on forested and swampy terrain, the [[Wallachia]]ns won the fierce battle and prevented Bayezid's army from advancing beyond the Danube.<ref>John V.A. Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', (The University of Michigan Press, 1994), 424.</ref>\n\nIn 1394, Bayezid laid siege to [[Constantinople]],<ref>Mango, Cyril.

[[Anadoluhisar\u0131]] fortress was built between 1393 and 1394 as part of preparations for the Second Ottoman Siege of Constantinople, which took place in 1395. On the urgings of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaeologus]] a new [[crusade]] was organized to defeat him. This proved unsuccessful: in 1396 the [[Christianity|Christian]] allies, under the leadership of the King of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and future [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (in 1433) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], were defeated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. Bayezid built the magnificent [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] in Bursa, to celebrate this victory.\n\n[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|Bayezid I held captive by [[Timur]], painting by [[Stanis\u0142aw Chlebowski]].]]\n\nThus the siege of Constantinople continued, lasting until 1402.<ref>Nancy Bisaha, ''Creating East And West: Renaissance Humanists And the Ottoman Turks'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 98.</ref> The beleaguered Byzantines had their reprieve when Bayezid fought the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]] in the East.<ref>Dimitris J.

In Asia, his domains extended to the [[Taurus Mountains]]. His army was considered one of the best in the Islamic world.\n\nIn 1397, Bayezid defeated the emir of Karaman in Ak\u00e7ay, killing him and annexing his territory. In 1398, the sultan conquered the Djanik emirate and the territory of Burhan al-Din, violating the accord with Timur. Finally, Bayezid occupied Elbistan and Malatya.\n\nIn 1400, the [[Turco-Mongol]] warlord [[Timur]] succeeded in rousing the local Turkic [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] who had been vassals of the Ottomans to join him in his attack on Bayezid, who was also considered one of the most powerful rulers in the Muslim world during that period. In the fateful [[Battle of Ankara]], on 20 July 1402, Bayezid was captured by Timur and the Ottoman army was defeated. Many writers claim that Bayezid was mistreated by the Timurids. However, writers and historians from Timur's own court reported that Bayezid was treated well, and that Timur even mourned his death.{{fact|date=February 2018}} One of Bayezid's sons, [[Mustafa \u00c7elebi]], was captured with him and held captive in [[Samarkand]] until 1405.\n\nFour of Bayezid's sons, specifically [[S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi]], [[\u0130sa \u00c7elebi]], [[Mehmed \u00c7elebi]], and [[Musa \u00c7elebi]], however, escaped from the battlefield and later started a civil war for the Ottoman throne known as the [[Ottoman Interregnum]].<ref>Dimitris J.

They embellished the legend that he was taken by Timur to [[Samarkand]] with a cast of characters to create an oriental fantasy that has maintained its appeal. [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'' was first performed in [[London]] in 1587, three years after the formal opening of English-Ottoman trade relations when [[William Harborne]] sailed for Constantinople as an agent of the [[Levant Company]].\n\nIn 1648, the play ''Le Gran Tamerlan et Bejezet'' by [[Jean Magnon]] appeared in London, and in 1725, [[Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' was first performed and published in London;<ref>London: Printed & sold by J. Cluer, [1725]</ref> [[Vivaldi]]'s version of the story, ''[[Bajazet (opera)|Bajazet]]'', was written in 1735. Magnon had given Bayezid an intriguing wife and daughter; the Handel and Vivaldi renditions included, as well as Tamerlane and Bayezid and his daughter, a prince of Byzantium and a princess of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] ([[Trabzon]]) in a passionate love story. A cycle of paintings in [[Schloss Eggenberg]], near [[Graz]] in [[Austria]], translated the theme to a different medium; this was completed in the 1670s shortly before the Ottoman army attacked the [[Habsburgs]] in central [[Europe]].<ref>Finkel, C.

Unlike many other Sultans, he worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of \"the Just\". Throughout his reign, Bayezid II engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] possessions in [[Morea]], accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]]. [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1499\u20131503)|The last of these wars]] ended in 1501 with Bayezid II in control of the whole Peloponnese. Rebellions in the east, such as that of the [[Qizilbash]], plagued much of Bayezid II's reign and were often backed by the [[Shah]] of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Ismail I|Ismail]], who was eager to promote [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ism]] to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in [[Anatolia]] was indeed seriously threatened during this period and at one point Bayezid II's [[vizier]], Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against rebels.\n\n===Jewish and Muslim immigration===<!--[[Moses_Capsali]] links here-->\n{{further|Nasrid\u2013Ottoman relations}}\nIn July 1492, the new state of [[Spain]] expelled its [[Jewish]] and [[Muslims|Muslim]] populations as part of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Bayezid II sent out the [[Ottoman Navy]] under the command of admiral [[Kemal Reis]] to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands.

[[Moses Capsali]], who probably helped to arouse the sultan's friendship for the Jews, was most energetic in his assistance to the exiles.

The first [[Gutenberg press|printing press]] in Constantinople was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493. It is reported that under Bayezid's reign, Jews enjoyed a period of cultural flourishing, with the presence of such scholars as the [[Talmudist]] and scientist [[Mordecai Comtino]]; astronomer and poet [[Solomon ben Elijah Sharbit|Solomon ben Elijah Sharbi\u1e6d ha-Zahab]]; [[Shabbat|Shabbethai]] ben Malkiel Cohen, and the liturgical poet Menahem Tamar.\n\n==Succession==\nOn 14 September 1509, [[Constantinople]]<ref>''The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''</ref><ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''</ref> was [[1509 Constantinople earthquake|devastated by an earthquake]]. During Bayezid II's final years, a succession battle developed between his sons [[Selim I]] and [[\u015eehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]]. Ahmet unexpectedly captured Karaman, an Ottoman city, and began marching to Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in [[Thrace]] but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee back to the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmet might in turn kill him to gain the throne, so he refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.\n\nSelim returned from Crimea and, with support from the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], forced his father to abdicate the throne on 25 April 1512. Bayezid departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died on 26 May 1512 at [[B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece]] before reaching his destination and only a month after his abdication.

In the game, due to Bayezid's absence from Constantinople, the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] had the opportunity to sneak back into the city, hoping to revive their fallen empire. Near the end of the game, Bayezid surrendered the throne to his son Selim. However, Bayezid does not make an actual appearance.\n* Bayezid II, prior to becoming Sultan, is depicted by [[Akin Gazi]] in the ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' series, ''[[Da Vinci's Demons]]''. He seeks an audience with [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (having been manipulated into believing that peace between Rome and Constantinople is a possibility), only to be ridiculed and humiliated by Sixtus, actions which later serve as a pretext for the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]].

In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Boxing' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, p.402, pp.415-416, 419-422</ref>\n\nBoxing was a popular spectator [[sport]] in [[Ancient Rome]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped [[leather]] thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a [[weapon]]. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the [[cestus]]. Fighting events were held at Roman [[Amphitheatres]]. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In [[AD]] 393, during the Roman [[gladiator]] period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Early London prize ring rules===\n[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's ''The Science of Defence: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]\n\nRecords of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting [[sports]] that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Russian fist fighting|Kulachniy Boy]] or \"Fist Fighting\".\n\nAs the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.<ref name=\"Roberts-1999\">{{cite web |title=James Figg |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/figg.html |date=1999 |publisher=[[IBHOF]] |accessdate=2018-03-22}} excerpting {{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=James B. |last2=Skutt |first2=Alexander G. |title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C |pages= |accessdate=22 March 2018 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=McBooks Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59013-121- 3|oclc=819715339}}</ref> This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.\n\nEarly fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by [[Parkyns baronets|Sir Thomas Parkyns]], a successful Wrestler from [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire]], who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, ''Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler'', described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |title=tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |publisher=Tumblr |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094646/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}</ref> Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.\n\n[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Cribb]] vs [[Tom Molineaux]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]\nThese rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"<ref>Anonymous (\"A Celebrated Pugilist\"), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825</ref> and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.<ref>Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790</ref> In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{fact|date=August 2018}} Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |title=blow-1.jpg |publisher=Yahoo! |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/classicpugilism/photos/album/1501552404/pic/1874370929/view?picmode=&mode=tn&order=ordinal&start=1&count=20&dir=asc |title=Yahoo!

Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.\nThe introduction of [[boxing gloves|gloves]] of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2006).

As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\nThrough the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy.

A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world. Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing.  Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent.

A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.\n\nUp to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging  and  other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.\n\nA bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions [[Mandatory eight count|require the referee to count to eight]] regardless of if the fighter gets up before.\n\nShould the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.\n\n[[File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ingemar Johansson]] of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]], 26 June 1959.]]\n\nIn general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).\n\nIf a \"clinch\" \u2013 a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause \u2013 is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.\n\nViolations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.\n\nUnheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.\n\n==Professional vs. amateur boxing==\n[[File:Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107 and Roberto Dur\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|left|[[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (right) appeared in a book by [[Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107]] (left)]]\nThroughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by [[money]], as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.\nThe modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|title=Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly|work=DNews|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career. Western boxers typically participate in one Olympics and then turn pro, Cubans and other socialist countries have an opportunity to collect multiple medals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/northern-ireland/19153615|title=Barry McGuigan explains Cuban boxing success|date=18 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and other tournaments sanctioned by [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/professional-boxers-allowed-compete-at-rio-olympics|title=Professional boxers will be allowed to compete at Rio Olympics|work=The Guardian}}</ref> This was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-Soviet republics have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/feature-articles/46924-president-john-brown-wrecking-ball|title=Feisty USA Boxing President John Brown Sees Better Times Ahead|work=The Sweet Science}}</ref> However, [[List of boxing organisations#Professional organisations|professional organizations]] strongly opposed that decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wbc-forbids-its-champions-and-ranked-fighters-from-going-to-olympics/|title=WBC forbids its champions and ranked fighters from going to Olympics|work=boxingnewsonline.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/sports/olympics/pro-boxers-at-the-olympics.html?referer=https://www.google.ru/|title=Pro Boxers at the Olympics: An Opportunity, or a Dangerous Power Grab?|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Amateur boxing===\n{{Main|Amateur boxing}}\n[[File:Nicola adams crop.PNG|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Nicola Adams]] is the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal. Here with [[Mary Kom]] of India.]]\n\nAmateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.\n\nCompetitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end just is a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under {{convert|165|lb}}, thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches \u2013 any boxer repeatedly landing low blows [[below the belt]] is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm |title=Andrew Eisele (2005).

There are also some two-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=329616 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> and three-round professional bouts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=521719 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the [[Boxing in the 1980s|early 1980s]], when the death of boxer [[Kim Duk-koo]] eventually prompted the [[World Boxing Council]] and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.\n\nHeadgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \"Boxing\", World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Boxing styles==\n\n===Definition of style===\n\"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: '''outside fighter''' (\"boxer\"), '''brawler''' (or \"slugger\"), and '''Inside fighter''' (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the [[rock-paper-scissors]] scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |title=The Science of Boxing Styles |publisher=Boxing Training Fitness |date= |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045101/http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |archivedate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Boxer/out-fighter====\n[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was a typical example of an out-fighter.]]\n\nA classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxingbeginners.com/how_to_box_styles.php|title=Learn about the different boxing styles.

This style was also used by fictional boxer [[Apollo Creed]].\n\n=====Boxer-puncher=====\nA boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_15_greatest_composite_punchers_of_all_time.html|title=The 15 Greatest Composite Punchers of All Time |website=Boxing.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.\n\nNotable boxer-punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Vasyl Lomachenko]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Joe Louis]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337</ref> [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Oscar de la Hoya]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120</ref> [[Henry Armstrong]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204</ref> [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403</ref> [[Tony Zale]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,</ref> [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Terry Norris]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Thomas Hearns]], and [[Gennady Golovkin]].\n\n=====Counter puncher=====\n[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punchers]] are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.\n\nNotable counter punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Max Schmeling]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[James J Corbett|Jim Corbett]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Anselmo Moreno]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]], [[Humberto Soto]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roger Mayweather]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez]] and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]]. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer [[Little Mac (Punch-Out!!)|Little Mac]].\n\nCounter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.\n\n====Brawler/slugger====\n[[File:George Foreman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Famous brawler [[George Foreman]]]]\nA brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power.  Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]] and [[Danny Garc\u00eda]].\n\nA brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include [[George Foreman]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Roberto Duran]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[John L Sullivan|John L. Sullivan]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[David Tua]], [[Arturo Gatti]], [[Micky Ward]], [[Brandon R\u00edos]], [[Ruslan Provodnikov]], [[Michael Katsidis]], [[James Kirkland (boxer)|James Kirkland]], [[Marcos Maidana]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]]. This style of boxing was also used by [[fiction]]al boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang.\n\nBrawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.\n\n====Swarmer/in-fighter====\n[[File:Henry Armstrong 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Armstrong]] was known for his aggressive, non-stop assault style of fighting.]]\nIn-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. Mainly [[Mexican people|Mexican]], Irish, [[Irish-American]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.\n\nThe essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Marvin Hagler]] was known for his hard \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.\n\nNotable in-fighters include [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Shawn Porter]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Manny Pacquiao]],  [[Rocky Marciano]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75</ref> [[Wayne McCullough]], [[Gerry Penalosa]], [[Harry Greb]],<ref>James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99</ref><ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340</ref> [[David Tua]], and [[Ricky Hatton]]. This style was also used by the Street Fighter character Balrog.\n\n===Combinations of styles===\nAll fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.\n\n===Style matchups===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Louis|Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], 1936]]\n\nThere is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock-paper-scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich\u00e9 amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights.\"\n\nBrawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]] in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\".\n\nAlthough in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.\n\nThe boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.\n\nAn example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Ch\u00e1vez, which only gave Ch\u00e1vez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Ch\u00e1vez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Ch\u00e1vez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Ch\u00e1vez could knock him out.\nWith about a minute left in the round, Ch\u00e1vez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Ch\u00e1vez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Ch\u00e1vez back ahead of him. Suddenly Ch\u00e1vez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Ch\u00e1vez' desperate final flurry. Ch\u00e1vez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Ch\u00e1vez with only two seconds to go in the bout.\n\n==Equipment==\nSince boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent [[Boxer's fracture|damage to bones in the hand]]. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.\n\nA [[mouthguard]] is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.\n\nBoxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and [[medicine balls]]. \n\nBoxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately.\n\nBoxing matches typically take place in a [[boxing ring]], a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Boxing styles and technique}}\n\n===Stance===\nThe modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''\nFile:attitude_semi-enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''\nFile:attitude_enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Full crouch''\n</gallery>\n\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.\n\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The [[southpaw stance]], conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\n\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\n\nModern boxers can sometimes be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet in order to move effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg in the direction of the movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.\n\n===Punches===\nThere are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:jab7.jpg|''[[Jab]]''\nFile:Drop3.jpg|''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] '' - in counter-punch with a looping\nFile:crochet1.jpg|''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''\nFile:uppercut2.jpg|''[[Uppercut]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Jab]]''' \u2013 A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.\n** The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or 'wear down' their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' \u2013 A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right|url=http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n** Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer is what gives the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\", especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.\n* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' \u2013 A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.\n** At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the \"rip\" to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand. Notable left hookers include [[Joe Frazier]], [[Roy Jones, Jr.|Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Mike Tyson]].\n[[File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Dominguez]] (''left'') throws an [[uppercut]] on [[Rafael Ortiz]] (''right'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Herbert G.|title=Boxing: A Worldwide Record of Bouts and Boxers|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-6054-0|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509012702/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|archive-date=9 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n* '''[[Uppercut]]''' \u2013 A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.\n** At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to \"lift\" the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.\n\nThese different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos.\" The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo.\" This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.\n\nA large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse,\" \"haymaker,\" \"overhand,\" or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.\n\nWide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.\n\nAnother unconventional punch is the rarely used [[bolo punch]], in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.\n\nAn illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a [[rabbit punch]].\n\nBoth the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.\n\n===Defense===\nThere are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:slip1.jpg|''[[Slipping]]''\nFile:slip2.jpg|''[[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]]''\nFile:blocage1.jpg|''[[Blocking (martial arts)|Blocking]] (with the arms)''\nFile:protection passive1.jpg|''[[Covering (martial arts)|Cover-Up]] (with the gloves)''\nFile:neutraliser1.jpg|''[[Clinch fighting|Clinching]]''\nFile:pas de retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''\nFile:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''\n\n</gallery>\n* '''Slip''' \u2013 [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to \"slip\" past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].\n* '''Sway or fade''' \u2013 To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called \"rolling with the punch\" or \" Riding The Punch\".\n* '''Duck''' or '''break''' \u2013 To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.\n* '''Bob and weave''' \u2013 [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.\n* '''Parry/block''' \u2013 [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A \"palm\", \"catch\", or \"cuff\" is a defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.\n* '''The cover-up''' \u2013 Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\n* The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' \u2013 Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\n===Less common strategies===\n* '''The \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy''' : Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"[[the Rumble in the Jungle]]\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown.\n* '''[[Bolo punch]]''' : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali shuffle]]. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavilan]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.\n<gallery>\nFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''\nFile:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand right]]''' : The overhand right is a punch not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the right cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand right has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand right has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking.\n* '''[[Check hook]]''' : A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.\n'''\n\n==Ring corner==\n[[File:2017-12-02 Tina Rupprecht - Anne Sophie Da Costa - DSC2771.jpg|thumb|right|Female boxer [[Tina Rupprecht]] receiving instructions from her trainer while being treated by her cutman in the ring corner between rounds.]]\nIn boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts and blood. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer's eyes.\n\nIn addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html |title=Phrases.org |publisher=Phrases.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]].

Editorials in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association urged the banning of boxing in light of new evidence suggesting the chronic brain damage was prevalent among fighters ... New evidence of the correlation between boxing and brain damage was reported in the journal by a team of Ohio doctors, led by Dr. [[Ronald J. Ross]], a radiologist in Mayfield Heights, Ohio ... [The AMA] concluded that for the time being [banning boxing] 'is not a realistic solution.' Instead, urging stricter medical supervision of the sport, it recommended establishment of a National Registry of Boxers ... Another recommendation was that all states provide for a ringside physician who would be 'authorized to stop any bout'.</ref> The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, called boxing an \"obscenity\" that \"should not be sanctioned by any civilized society.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundberg |first=George D. |title= Boxing should be banned in civilized countries |work=Journal of the American Medical Association |year= 1983 |pages= 249\u2013250 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=381940 |publisher=Jama.jamanetwork.com}}</ref> Since then, the British,<ref>[http://www.bma.org.uk/health_promotion_ethics/sports_exercise/BoxingPU.jsp BMA.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208211719/http://www.bma.org.uk/health_promotion_ethics/sports_exercise/BoxingPU.jsp |date=8 February 2011 }}</ref> Canadian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/3385/la_id/1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311085433/https://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/3385/la_id/1.htm |archivedate=11 March 2016 }}</ref> and Australian<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Medical Association |url=https://ama.com.au/ |title=CMA.ca |publisher=Ama.com.au |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> Medical Associations have called for bans on boxing.\n\nSupporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal.

Sanders in 1980. Since its inception, the WBHOF has never had a permanent location or museum, which has allowed the more recent IBHOF to garner more publicity and prestige. Among the notable names{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} in the WBHF are [[Ricardo \"Finito\" Lopez]], [[Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde]], [[Michael Carbajal]], [[Khaosai Galaxy]], [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[George Foreman]], [[Ceferino Garcia]] and [[Salvador Sanchez]]. Boxing's International Hall of Fame was inspired by a tribute an American town held for two local heroes in 1982. The town, [[Canastota, New York]], (which is about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Syracuse, via the New York State Thruway), honored former world [[welterweight]]/[[middleweight]] champion [[Carmen Basilio]] and his nephew, former world welterweight champion [[Billy Backus]]. The people of Canastota raised money for the tribute which inspired the idea of creating an official, annual hall of fame for notable boxers.\n\nThe [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] opened in Canastota in 1989. The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, [[Benny Leonard]], Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], [[Archie Moore]],  and Muhammad Ali. Other world-class figures{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} include Salvador Sanchez, [[Jose Napoles]], Roberto \"Manos de Piedra\" Dur\u00e1n, [[Ricardo Lopez (boxer)|Ricardo Lopez]], [[Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde]], [[Vicente Saldivar]], Ismael Laguna, Eusebio Pedroza, Carlos Monz\u00f3n, Azumah Nelson, [[Rocky Marciano]], Pipino Cuevas and [[Ken Buchanan]]. The Hall of Fame's induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four-day event. The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself.\n\nThe Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas features the $75 million ESPN Classic Sports fight film and tape library and radio broadcast collection. The collection includes the fights of all the great champions including: [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[George Foreman]], [[Roberto Duran]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Joe Louis]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]].  It is this exclusive fight film library that will separate the Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas from the other halls of fame which do not have rights to any video of their sports. The inaugural inductees included [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Tony Canzoneri]], [[Ezzard Charles]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez|Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Sr.]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Roberto Duran]], [[Joe Louis]], and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/box/blog/box_experts/post/boxing-hall-of-fame-las-vegas-announces-first-class-of-inductees-gives-sport-its-third-hall?urn=box,wp3216 |title=Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas announces first class of inductees, gives sport its third hall - Boxing Experts Blog - Boxing Blog - Yahoo!

Deming refers to the area as Tollywood, since it already boasted two studios with 'several more projected' (Prasad, 2003) 'Tolly', rhyming with 'Holly', got hinged to 'wood' in the Anglophone Indian imagination, and came to denote the Calcutta studios and, by extension, the local film industry.

Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.<ref name=\"britannica2\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Ardeshir Irani, of ''Alam Ara'' fame, made the first colour film in [[Hindi]], ''[[Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of ''Mother India''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.\n\nPrior to the 1947 [[partition of India]], which was divided into the [[Republic of India]] and [[Pakistan]], the Bombay film industry (now called Bollywood) was closely to the [[Lahore]] film industry (now the [[Lollywood]] industry of [[Pakistani cinema]]), as both produced films in [[Hindi-Urdu]], or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' across northern and central India. In the 1940s, many actors, filmmakers and musicians in the Lahore industry migrated to the Bombay industry, including actors such as [[K.L. Saigal]], [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Dev Anand]] and singers such as [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Noorjahan]] and [[Shamshad Begum]]. Around that time, filmmakers and actors from the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] based in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) also began migrating to the Bombay film industry, which for decades after partition would be dominated by actors, filmmakers and musicians with origins in what is today [[Pakistani Punjab]], along with those from [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Partha S.|title=Migrants, Refugees and the Stateless in South Asia|date=2016|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|isbn=9789351508557|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X242DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA263|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Golden Age (late 1940s\u20131960s)===\nFollowing [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]], the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the \"Golden Age\" of Hindi cinema.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K.

It combined the [[dacoit film]] conventions of ''Mother India'' and ''Gunga Jumna'' with that of [[Spaghetti Western]]s, spawning the [[Dacoit Western]] genre (also known as the \"[[Curry Western]]\"), which was popular in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Teo\"/>\n\nSome Hindi filmmakers such as [[Shyam Benegal]] continued to produce realistic [[Parallel Cinema]] throughout the 1970s,<ref name=Rajadhyaksa96-685>Rajadhyaksa, 685</ref> alongside [[Mani Kaul]], [[Kumar Shahani]], [[Ketan Mehta]], [[Govind Nihalani]] and [[Vijaya Mehta]].<ref name=Gokulsing-18/> However, the 'art film' bent of the Film Finance Corporation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema. The 1970s thus saw the rise of commercial cinema in the form of enduring films such as ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), which consolidated [[Amitabh Bachchan]]'s position as a lead actor.

Examples of this influence include the techniques of a [[side story]], [[back-story]] and [[story within a story]]. Indian popular films often have plots which branch off into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films ''[[Khalnayak]]'' and ''[[Gardish]]''.<ref name=Gokulsing/>\n* Ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], with its highly stylised nature and emphasis on spectacle, where [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combined \"to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience.\" Sanskrit dramas were known as ''[[Natya Shastra|natya]]'', derived from the root word ''nrit'' (dance), characterising them as spectacular dance-dramas which has continued Indian cinema.<ref name=Gokulsing/> The theory of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' dating back to ancient Sanskrit drama is believed to be one of the most fundamental features that differentiate Indian cinema, particularly Hindi cinema, from that of the Western world.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Bollywood, Rasa and Indian Cinema: Misconceptions, Meanings and Millionaire|author=Matthew Jones|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 2010|pages=33\u201343|doi=10.1080/08949460903368895|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n* The traditional folk [[theatre of India]], which became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the [[Jatra (theatre)|Jatra]] of [[Bengal]], the [[Ramlila]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and the [[Terukkuttu]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref name=Gokulsing/>\n* The [[Parsi theatre]], which \"blended [[Neorealism (art)|realism]] and [[fantasy]], music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.\"<ref name=Gokulsing/>\n* [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], where [[musical film|musicals]] were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s, though Indian filmmakers departed from their [[Hollywood]] counterparts in several ways. \"For example, the Hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself. Indian filmmakers, while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in Indian popular films, used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films. There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, fairy stories and so on through song and dance.\" In addition, \"whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day to day lives in complex and interesting ways.\"<ref name=Gokulsing/>\n* Western musical television, particularly [[MTV]], which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s, as can be seen in the pace, camera angles, dance sequences and music of 2000s Indian films. An early example of this approach was in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' (1995).<ref name=Gokulsing/>\n\nSharmistha Gooptu and Bhaumik identify [[Indo-Persian culture|Indo-Persian]]/[[Islamicate]] culture as a major influence. In the early 20th century, [[Urdu]] was the [[lingua franca]] of popular cultural performances across northern India, established in popular [[performance art]] traditions such as [[nautch]] dancing, [[Urdu poetry]], and Parsi theater. Urdu and related [[Hindi dialects]] were the most widely understood across northern India, thus [[Hindi-Urdu]] became the standardized language of early Indian [[talkies]]. The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'') also had a strong influence, on Parsi theater which performed \"[[Persianate]] adventure-romances\" that were adapted into films, and on early Bombay cinema where \"''Arabian Nights'' cinema\" was a popular genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gooptu|first=Sharmistha|title=Bengali Cinema: 'An Other Nation'|date=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136912177|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcUtCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe scholars Chaudhuri Diptakirti and [[Rachel Dwyer]], and the screenwriter [[Javed Akhtar]], identify [[Urdu literature]] as a major influence on Hindi cinema.<ref name=\"Chaudhuri2015\">{{cite book|last=Chaudhuri|first=Diptakirti|title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema\u2019s Greatest Screenwriters|date=2015|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9789352140084|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Rachel|authorlink=Rachel Dwyer|title=Filming the Gods: Religion and Indian Cinema|date=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781134380701|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsKR1RKoJKUC&pg=PA106|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer2014\">{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Rachel|authorlink=Rachel Dwyer|title=Picture Abhi Baaki Hai: Bollywood as a Guide to Modern India|date=2014|publisher=[[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]|isbn=9789350098608|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PV2HBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT70|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Akhtar\"/> Most of the screenwriters and scriptwriters of classic Hindi cinema often came from Urdu literary backgrounds,<ref name=\"Dwyer2014\"/><ref name=\"Chaudhuri2015\"/><ref name=\"Akhtar\"/> from [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] and [[Akhtar ul Iman]] to [[Salim-Javed]] and [[Rahi Masoom Raza]], while a handful of screenwriters and scriptwriters also came from other [[Indian literature|Indian literary]] traditions such as [[Bengali literature]] and [[Hindi literature]].<ref name=\"Chaudhuri2015\"/> Most of Hindi cinema's classic scriptwriters wrote their scripts and dialogues mainly in Urdu, including the likes of Salim-Javed, [[Gulzar]], [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]], [[Inder Raj Anand]], Rahi Masoom Raza and [[Wajahat Mirza]].<ref name=\"Akhtar\"/> Urdu poetry strongly influenced [[filmi]] [[Bollywood songs]],<ref name=\"Dwyer\"/><ref name=\"Akhtar\"/> where the lyrics draw heavily from Urdu poetry and the [[ghazal]] tradition.<ref name=\"Dwyer\"/>\n\nTodd Stadtman identifies several foreign influences on commercial Bollywood [[masala film]]s in the 1970s, including [[New Hollywood]], Italian [[exploitation film]]s, and [[Hong Kong martial arts cinema]].<ref name=\"funky\"/> Starting with ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), Bollywood films up until the 1990s often incorporated fight sequences inspired by 1970s [[martial arts film]]s from [[Hong Kong cinema]].<ref name=\"Heide\">{{cite book|last=Heide|first=William Van der|title=Malaysian Cinema, Asian Film: Border Crossings and National Cultures|date=2002|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|isbn=9789053565803|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3HTdu1HuWQC&pg=PA148|language=en}}</ref> Rather than following the Hollywood model, Bollywood action scenes tended to follow the Hong Kong model, with an emphasis on acrobatics and [[Stunt performer|stunts]], and combining [[kung fu]] (as it was perceived by Indians) with [[Indian martial arts]] (particularly [[Pehlwani|Indian wrestling]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Meaghan|last2=Li|first2=Siu Leung|last3=Chan|first3=Stephen Ching-kiu|title=Hong Kong Connections: Transnational Imagination in Action Cinema|date=2005|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|isbn=9781932643190|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrHAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Influence of Bollywood==\n===India===\nPerhaps the biggest influence of Bollywood has been on nationalism in [[India]] itself, where along with rest of Indian cinema, it has become part and parcel of the 'Indian story'.<ref name=desai2013>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-22335309|title= How Bollywood mirrors Indian realities|last1= Desai|first1= Lord Meghnad|date= 4 May 2013 |publisher= BBC|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> In India, Bollywood is often associated with India's national identity.<ref name=\":0\"/> In the words of the economist and Bollywood biographer [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Lord Meghnad Desai]],<ref name=desai2013 />\n<blockquote>Cinema actually has been the most vibrant medium for telling [[India]] its own story, the story of its struggle for independence, its constant struggle to achieve national integration and to emerge as a global presence.</blockquote>\n\nBollywood has influenced Indian society and culture for a long time.

They are called ''[[Masala film]]s'', after the Hindi word for a spice mixture. Like ''masalas'', these movies are a mixture of many things such as action, comedy, romance and so on. Most films have heroes who are able to fight off villains all by themselves.\n\nBollywood plots have tended to be [[melodramatic]]. They frequently employ formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers and angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains, [[Hooker with a heart of gold|courtesans with hearts of gold]], long-lost relatives and siblings separated by fate, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences.\n\nThere have always been Indian films with more artistic aims and more sophisticated stories, both inside and outside the Bollywood tradition (see [[Parallel Cinema]]). They often lost out at the box office to movies with more mass appeal. Bollywood conventions are changing, however. A large Indian diaspora in English-speaking countries, and increased [[Western culture|Western]] influence at home, have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood models.<ref name=\"Migration\">{{cite book |author1=Gupta, Suman |author2=Omoniyi, Tope |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nr2724-bOfMC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202 |year=2001|title=The Cultures of Economic Migration: International Perspectives|page=202|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-7070-4}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic Lata Khubchandani writes, \"our earliest films ... had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them.

There have been some exceptions, of which one recent example is the hit film ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'', where the lead actress is [[Alice Patten]], an Englishwoman. ''[[Kisna]]'', ''[[Lagaan]]'', and ''[[The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey]]'' also featured foreign actors. Of late, [[Emma Brown Garett]], an Australian born actress, has starred in a few Indian films.\n\nBollywood can be very clannish, and the relatives of film-industry insiders have an edge in getting coveted roles in films or being part of a film's crew. However, industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce and if film industry scions do not succeed at the box office, their careers will falter. Some of the biggest stars, such as [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Sunny Deol]], [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan]]  have succeeded despite a lack of any show business connections.

This phenomenon is compared to the pairings of American composers and songwriters that created old-time Broadway musicals.\n\n==Sound==\nSound in Bollywood films was once rarely recorded on location (otherwise known as sync sound). Therefore, the sound was usually created (or re-created) entirely in the studio,<ref name=\"dubbing\">{{cite news|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/News-Gossip/Did-you-Know-/Lagaan-used-synchronized-sound/articleshow/3987370.cms|title=Lagaan used synchronized sound|date=16 January 2009|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=29 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with the actors reciting their lines as their images appear on-screen in the studio in the process known as \"looping in the sound\" or [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]]\u2014with the [[Voice Foley|foley]] and sound effects added later. This created several problems, since the sound in these films usually occurs a frame or two earlier or later than the mouth movements or gestures.<ref name=\"dubbing\"/> The actors had to act twice: once on-location, once in the studio\u2014and the emotional level on set is often very difficult to re-create. Commercial Indian films, not just the Hindi-language variety, are known for their lack of ambient sound, so there is a silence underlying everything instead of the background sound and noises usually employed in films to create aurally perceivable depth and environment.\n\nThe ubiquity of ADR in Bollywood cinema became prevalent in the early 1960s with the arrival of the [[Arri|Arriflex 3]] camera, which required a blimp (cover) to shield the sound of the camera, for which it was notorious, from on-location filming. Commercial Indian filmmakers, known for their speed, never bothered to blimp the camera, and its excessive noise required that everything had to be re-created in the studio. Eventually, this became the standard for Indian films.\n\nThe trend was bucked in 2001, after a 30-year hiatus of synchronised sound, with the film ''[[Lagaan]]'', in which the sound was done on the location.<ref name=\"dubbing\"/> This opened up a heated debate on the use and economic feasibility of on-location sound, and several Bollywood films have employed on-location sound since then.\n\n==Makeup==\nIn 1955 the Bollywood group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists.<ref name=\"telegraphindia1\">{{cite web|author=Samyabrata Ray Goswami |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141111/jsp/frontpage/story_19024241.jsp |title=Women get makeup justice |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref> However, in 2014 the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty).<ref name=\"telegraphindia1\"/> The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no \"rationale nexus\" to the cause sought to be achieved and was \"unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent\" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens.<ref name=\"telegraphindia1\"/> The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work.<ref name=\"telegraphindia1\"/> In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association.<ref>{{cite web|author=Amit Anand Choudhary |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bollywood/Bollywood-make-up-artists-group-inducts-first-woman-after-SC-rap/articleshow/46995208.cms |title=Bollywood make-up artists' group inducts first woman after SC rap |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Bollywood song and dance==\n[[File:Bollywood Playback Singers.jpg|thumb|right|A group of Bollywood singers at the Indian Singers' Rights Association (ISRA) meet in 2013.]]\n{{further|Music of Bollywood|Filmi|Filmi-ghazal|Filmi qawwali|Hindi dance songs}}\nBollywood film music is called [[filmi]] music (from Hindi, meaning \"of films\"). Songs from Bollywood movies are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then [[lip sync]]hing the words to the song on-screen, often while dancing. While most actors, especially today, are excellent dancers, few are also singers. One notable exception was [[Kishore Kumar]], who starred in several major films in the 1950s while also having a stellar career as a playback singer. [[Kundan Lal Saigal|K. L. Saigal]], Suraiyya, and [[Noor Jehan]] were also known as both singers and actors. Some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves; for a list, see [[Singing actors and actresses in Indian cinema]].\n\nSongs are what make and break the movie; they determine if it is going to be a flop or a hit: \"Few films without successful musical tracks, and even fewer without any songs and dances, succeed\"<ref name=\":1\">Rao, S. (2010). \"I Need an Indian Touch\": Glocalization and Bollywood Films. ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication'', ''3''(1), 1-19. {{doi|10.1080/17513050903428117}}\n</ref> With the increase of globalization, there has also been a change in the type of music that Bollywood films entail; the lyrics of the songs have increasingly been a mix of Hindi and English languages, as opposed to the strict Hindi prior to Globalization. Also, with the inspiration of global trends, such as Salsa, Pop and Hip Hop, there has been a modification of the type of music heard in Bollywood films.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPlayback singers are prominently featured in the opening credits and have their own [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] who will go to an otherwise lackluster movie just to hear their favourites. Going by the quality as well as the quantity of the songs they rendered, most notable singers of Bollywood are [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Sadhana Sargam]] and [[Alka Yagnik]] among female playback singers; and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sonu Nigam]] among male playback singers. Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi are often considered arguably the finest of the singers that have lent their voice to Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar, who, through the course of a career spanning over six decades, has recorded thousands of songs for Indian movies. The composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. Their songs can make or break a film and usually do. [[Remix]]ing of film songs with modern beats and rhythms is a common occurrence today, and producers may even release remixed versions of some of their films' songs along with the films' regular soundtrack albums.\n\nThe dancing in Bollywood films, especially older ones, is primarily modelled on Indian dance: classical dance styles, dances of historic northern Indian courtesans ([[tawaif]]), or [[folk dance]]s. In modern films, Indian dance elements often blend with Western dance styles (as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals), though it is usual to see Western pop ''and'' pure classical dance numbers side by side in the same film. The hero or heroine will often perform with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films feature unrealistically instantaneous shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in beautiful natural surroundings or architecturally grand settings. This staging is referred to as a \"picturisation\".\n\nSongs typically comment on the action taking place in the movie, in several ways. Sometimes, a song is worked into the plot, so that a character has a reason to sing. Other times, a song is an externalisation of a character's thoughts, or presages an event that has not occurred yet in the plot of the movie. In this case, the event is often two characters falling in love. The songs are also often referred to as a \"dream sequence\", and anything can happen that would not normally happen in the real world.\n\nPreviously song and dance scenes often used to be shot in [[Kashmir]], but due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2935951.stm BBC News: Kashmir beckons Bollywood] (10 April 2003).</ref> those scenes have since then often been shot in Western Europe, particularly in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].<ref>[http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Ausstellungen/Archiv/2002/Bollywood/E_Bollywood.html BOLLYWOOD \u2013 The Indian Cinema and Switzerland (2002)]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118005321/http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Ausstellungen/Archiv/2002/Bollywood/E_Bollywood.html |date=18 January 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/14/stories/2008021459770700.htm The Hindu: Bollywood boosts Austria's tourism potential].

Often the soundtrack is more popular than the movie. In the last few years some producers have also been releasing music videos, usually featuring a song from the film. However, some promotional videos feature a song which is not included in the movie.\n\n==Finances==\nBollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to 1 billion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] (roughly USD 20 million). The latest Science fiction movie ''[[Ra.One]]'' was made at an immense budget of 1.35 billion (roughly USD 27 million), making it the most expensive movie ever produced in Bollywood.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Times of India |author2=movie report |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-06/special-report/30366066_1_ke-liye-shah-rukh-khan-big-stars|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=The Times of India|title=It took me 20 years to be an overnight success: Shah Rukh Khan|date=6 November 2011}}</ref> [[Set (drama)|Sets]], costumes, special effects, and [[cinematography]] were less than world-class up until the mid-to-late 1990s, although with some notable exceptions. As Western films and television gain wider distribution in India itself, there is an increasing pressure for Bollywood films to attain the same production levels, particularly in areas such as action and special effects. Recent Bollywood films have employed international technicians to improve in these areas, such as ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006) which has action choreographed by Hong Kong based [[Tony Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The increasing accessibility to professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, has seen an explosion in the action and sci-fi genres.\n\nSequences shot overseas have proved a real box office draw, so Mumbai film crews are increasingly filming in Australia, Canada, [[New Zealand]], the United Kingdom, the United States, [[continental Europe]] and elsewhere. Nowadays, Indian producers are winning more and more funding for big-budget films shot within India as well, such as ''[[Lagaan]]'', ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' and other recent films.\n\nFunding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large [[Movie studio|studios]]. Indian banks and financial institutions were forbidden from lending money to movie studios. However, this ban has now been lifted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/mar/31sush.htm |title=I & B Ministry will help film industry |publisher=Rediff |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> As finances are not regulated, some funding also comes from illegitimate sources, such as the [[Mumbai underworld]]. The Mumbai underworld has been known to be involved in the production of several films, and are notorious for patronising several prominent film personalities. On occasion, they have been known to use money and muscle power to get their way in cinematic deals. In January 2000, Mumbai mafia hitmen shot [[Rakesh Roshan]], a film director and father of star [[Hrithik Roshan]]. In 2001, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] seized all prints of the movie ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'' after the movie was found to be funded by members of the [[Mumbai underworld]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Singh, Vijay|title=Bharat Shah sentenced, but won't have to spend time in prison|date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/oct/01shah.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=14 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother problem facing Bollywood is widespread [[copyright infringement]] of its films. Often, bootleg [[DVD#DVD Video|DVD]] copies of movies are available before the prints are officially released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is a well established 'small scale industry' in parts of South Asia and [[South East Asia]]. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually in loss of revenue from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. Besides catering to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst some sections of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], too. (In fact, bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Government of Pakistan has banned their sale, distribution and telecast). Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by countless small cable TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance, while consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to the industry's losses.\n\nSatellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making huge inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now fewer tend to do so. However, most Bollywood producers make money, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue, including selling ancillary rights. There are also increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly getting noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films.\n\nFor a comparison of Hollywood and Bollywood financial figures, see chart. It shows tickets sold in 2002 and total revenue estimates. Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had total revenues (theatre tickets, DVDs, television and so on.) of US$1.3 billion, whereas Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets and generated total revenues (again from all formats) of US$51 billion.\n\n==Advertising==\nMany Indian artists used to make a living by hand-painting movie billboards and posters (The well-known artist [[M F Husain|M.F. Hussain]] used to paint film posters early in his career). This was because human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material.<ref name=\"paint\">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ahmedabad-times/a-different-canvas/articleshow/1027777.cms|title=A different canvas|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 February 2005|accessdate=21 November 2008|author=Ramanan, Manju}}</ref> Now, a majority of the huge and ubiquitous billboards in India's major cities are created with computer-printed vinyl.

Advertisers say that a star endorsement boosts sales.\n\n==International shoots==\nWith the increasing prominence of international setting such as Switzerland, London, Paris, New York, Brazil, Singapore and so on, it does not entail that the people and cultures residing in these exotic settings are represented. Contrary to these spaces and geographies being filmed as they are, they are actually Indianized by adding Bollywood actors and Hindi speaking extras to them. While immersing in Bollywood films, viewers get to see their local experiences duplicated in different locations around the world.\n\nRao states that \"Media representation can depict India's shifting relation with the world economy, but must retain its 'Indianness' in moments of dynamic hybridity\",<ref name=\":1\"/> where \"Indianness\" refers to the cultural identity and political affiliation.  With Bollywood's popularity among diasporic audiences, \"Indianness\" poses a problem, but at the same time, it gives back to its homeland audience, a sense of uniqueness from other immigrant groups.<ref>O'Neill, P.

In addition, the Soviet Union was recovering from the onslaught of the Second World War. The films from India, which were also recovering from the disaster of partition and the struggle for freedom from colonial rule, were found to be a good source of providing hope with entertainment to the struggling masses. The aspirations and needs of the people of both countries matched to a great extent. These films were dubbed in Russian and shown in theatres throughout the Soviet Union. The films from Bollywood also strengthened family values, which was a big factor for their popularity with the government authorities in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles/Indian-films.asp |title=Promoting Bollywood Abroad Will Help to Promote India |last=Ashreena |first=Tanya |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003948/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles/Indian-films.asp |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe film ''[[Mera Naam Joker]]'' (1970), sought to cater to such an appeal and the popularity of [[Raj Kapoor]] in Russia, when it recruited Russian actress [[Kseniya Ryabinkina]] for the movie.

''[[Mother India]]'' (1957), for example, continued to be played in [[Nigeria]] decades after its release. Indian movies have also gained ground so as to alter the style of [[Hausa people|Hausa]] fashions, songs have also been copied by Hausa singers and stories have influenced the writings of Nigerian novelists. Stickers of Indian films and stars decorate taxis and buses in Northern Nigeria, while posters of Indian films adorn the walls of tailor shops and mechanics' garages in the country. Unlike in Europe and North America where Indian films largely cater to the expatriate Indian market yearning to keep in touch with their homeland, in West Africa, as in many other parts of the world, such movies rose in popularity despite the lack of a significant Indian audience, where movies are about an alien culture, based on a religion wholly different, and, for the most part, a language that is unintelligible to the viewers. One such explanation for this lies in the similarities between the two cultures. Other similarities include wearing turbans; the presence of animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, chewing sugar cane; youths riding [[Bajaj Auto|Bajaj]] motor scooters; wedding celebrations, and so forth. With the strict Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show \"respect\" toward women, where [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood movies]] were seen to have \"no shame\". In Indian movies women were modestly dressed, men and women rarely kiss, and there is no [[nudity]], thus Indian movies are said to \"have culture\" that Hollywood films lack. The latter choice was a failure because \"they don't base themselves on the problems of the people,\" where the former is based socialist values and on the reality of developing countries emerging from years of colonialism. Indian movies also allowed for a new youth culture to follow without such ideological baggage as \"becoming western.\"<ref name=\"samar\">{{cite web|last=Larkin |first=Brian |url=http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=21 |title=Bollywood Comes To Nigeria |publisher=Samarmagazine.org |date=31 August 2002 |accessdate=12 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731164710/http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=21 |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}</ref> The first ever movie to be shot in Mauritius was [[Souten]] starring [[Rajesh Khanna]] in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.silverdollarproduction.com/film-shooting.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220145113/http://www.silverdollarproduction.com/film-shooting.html |archive-date=20 December 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[South Africa]], film imports from India were watched by both [[Black South African]] and [[Indian South African]] audiences.<ref name=\"Rajinder\"/> Several Bollywood personalities have avenued to the continent for both shooting movies and off-camera projects.

It is played on a [[bowling green]] which may be flat (for \"flat-green bowls\") or convex or uneven (for \"[[crown green bowls]]\"). It is normally played outdoors (although there are many indoor venues) and the outdoor surface is either natural grass, [[artificial turf]], or [[cotula]] (in New Zealand).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bowls match.JPG|thumb|Bowls match in progress at [[Wookey Hole]], United Kingdom]]\nIt has been traced certainly to the 13th century, and conjecturally to the 12th. [[William Fitzstephen]] (d. about 1190), in his biography of [[Thomas Becket]], gives a graphic sketch of the [[London]] of his day and, writing of the summer amusements of the young men, says that on holidays they were \"exercised in Leaping, Shooting, Wrestling, Casting of Stones [in jactu lapidum], and Throwing of Javelins fitted with Loops for the Purpose, which they strive to fling before the Mark; they also use Bucklers, like fighting Men.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Introduction - FitzStephen's Description of London|website=users.trytel.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref> It is commonly supposed that by jactus lapidum, Fitzstephen meant the game of bowls, but though it is possible that round stones may sometimes have been employed in an early variety of the game - and there is a record of iron bowls being used, though at a much later date, on festive occasions at Nairn, - nevertheless the inference seems unwarranted. The jactus lapidum of which he speaks may have been more akin to [[shot put]]. It is beyond dispute, however, that the game, at any rate in a rudimentary form, was played in the 13th century. A manuscript of that period in the royal library, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] (No. 20, E iv.), contains a drawing representing two players aiming at a small cone instead of an earthenware ball or jack. The world's oldest surviving bowling green is the [[Southampton Old Bowling Green]], which was first used in 1299.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A311482|title=Southampton Old Bowling Green, Southampton, England|accessdate=6 January 2009 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nAnother manuscript of the same century has a crude but spirited picture which brings us into close touch with the existing game.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Three figures are introduced and a jack. The first player's bowl has come to rest just in front of the jack; the second has delivered his bowl and is following after it with one of those eccentric contortions still not unusual on modern greens, the first player meanwhile making a repressive gesture with his hand, as if to urge the bowl to stop short of his own; the third player is depicted as in the act of delivering his bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greydragon.org/library/playingbowls.html|title=Playing at Bowls|website=www.greydragon.org|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref> A 14th-century manuscript, Book of Prayers, in the [[Francis Douce]] collection in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] contains a drawing in which two persons are shown, but they bowl to no mark. Strutt (Sports and Pastimes) suggests that the first player's bowl may have been regarded by the second player as a species of jack; but in that case it is not clear what was the first player's target. In these three earliest illustrations of the pastime it is worth noting that each player has one bowl only, and that the attitude in delivering it was as various five or six hundred years ago as it is today. In the third he stands almost upright; in the first he kneels; in the second he stoops, halfway between the upright and the kneeling position.\n\nThe game eventually came under the ban of king and parliament, both fearing it might jeopardise the practice of archery, then so important in battle. Statutes forbidding it and other sports were enacted in the reigns of [[Edward III]], [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and other monarchs. Even when, on the invention of gunpowder and firearms, the bow had fallen into disuse as a weapon of war, the prohibition was continued. The discredit attaching to bowling alleys, first established in London in 1455, probably encouraged subsequent repressive legislation, for many of the alleys were connected with taverns frequented by the dissolute and gamesters. The word \"bowls\" occurs for the first time in the statute of 1511 in which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] confirmed previous enactments against unlawful games. By a further act of 1541\u2014which was not repealed until 1845\u2014artificers, labourers, apprentices, servants and the like were forbidden to play bowls at any time except [[Christmas]], and then only in their master's house and presence. It was further enjoined that any one playing bowls outside his own garden or orchard was liable to a penalty of 6s. 8d.(6 shillings and 8 pence), while those possessed of lands of the yearly value of \u00a3100 might obtain licences to play on their own private greens.\n\nIn 1864 William Wallace Mitchell (1803\u20131884), a Glasgow Cotton Merchant, published his \"Manual of Bowls Playing\" following his work as the secretary formed in 1849 by Scottish bowling clubs which became the basis of the rules of the modern game.\nYoung Mitchell was only 11 when he played on Kilmarnock Bowling green, the oldest club in Scotland, instituted in 1740.\n[[File:British bowlers (HS85-10-17553).jpg|thumb|left|British bowls team visiting Canada, 1906]]\n[[File:Lawn bowls, Central Park.jpg|thumb|right|Bowling greens in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]]]\nThe patenting of the first [[lawn mower#History|lawn mower]] in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, for the preparation of modern-style greens, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc. This is turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn bowls, most football codes, lawn tennis and others.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\nNational Bowling Associations were established in the late 1800s. In the then Victorian Colony (now State of Victoria in Australia), the (Royal) [[Victorian Bowling Association]] was formed in 1880 and The Scottish Bowling Association was established in 1892, although there had been a failed attempt in 1848 by 200 Scottish clubs.\n\nToday the sport is played in over 40 countries with more than 50 member national authorities.\nThe home of the modern game is still Scotland with the World Bowls centre in Edinburgh at Caledonia House,1 Redheughs Rigg, South Gyle, Edinburgh, EH12 9DQ.\n\n==Game==\n\n[[File:Drumoak and district bowling green.jpg|thumb|right|[[Drumoak]] bowling green]]\nLawn bowls is usually played on a large, rectangular, precisely levelled and manicured [[Lawn|grass]] or synthetic surface known as a [[bowling green]] which is divided into parallel playing strips called [[bowling green|rink]]s. In the simplest competition, singles, one of the two opponents flips a coin to see who wins the \"mat\" and begins a segment of the competition (in bowling parlance, an \"end\"), by placing the mat and rolling the jack to the other end of the green to serve as a target. Once it has come to rest, the jack is aligned to the centre of the rink and the players take turns to roll their bowls from the mat towards the jack and thereby build up the \"head\".\n\nA bowl may curve outside the rink boundary on its path, but must come to rest within the rink boundary to remain in play. Bowls falling into the ditch are dead and removed from play, except in the event when one has \"touched\" the jack on its way. \"Touchers\" are marked with chalk and remain alive in play even though they are in the ditch. Similarly if the jack is knocked into the ditch it is still alive unless it is out of bounds to the side resulting in a \"dead\" end which is replayed, though according to international rules the jack is \"respotted\" to the centre of the rink and the end is continued. After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles and pairs, three each in triples, and two bowls each in fours), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points, called \"shots\", are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack. For instance, if a competitor has bowled two bowls closer to the jack than their opponent's nearest, they are awarded two shots. The exercise is then repeated for the next end, a game of bowls typically being of twenty-one ends.\n\nLawn bowls is played on grass and variations from green to green are common. Greens come in all shapes and sizes, fast, slow, big crown, small crown and so on.\n\nBowls is generally played in a very good spirit, even at the highest professional level, acknowledgment of opponents' successes and near misses being quite normal.\n\n==Scoring==\nScoring systems vary from competition to competition. Games can be decided when:\n* a player in a singles game reaches a specified target number of shots (usually 21 or 25).\n* a team (pair, triple or four) has the higher score after a specified number of ends.\n\nGames to a specified number of ends may also be drawn. The draw may stand, or the opponents may be required to play an '''extra end''' to decide the winner. These provisions are always published beforehand in the event's '''Conditions of Play'''.\n\nIn the Laws of the Sport of Bowls<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html |title=Laws of the Sport of Bowls (2011, Crystal Mark Second Edition), World Bowls |accessdate=1 April 2011 |publisher=World Bowls |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409002720/http://www.worldbowlsltd.co.uk/laws/index.html |archivedate=9 April 2011 }}</ref> the winner in a singles game is the first player to score 21 shots. In all other disciplines (pairs, triples, fours) the winner is the team who has scored the most shots after 21/25 ends of play. Often local tournaments will play shorter games (often 10 or 12 ends). Some competitions use a \"set\" scoring system, with the first to seven points awarded a set in a best-or-three or best-of-five set match. As well as singles competition, there can be two (pairs), three (triples) and four-player (fours) teams. In these, teams bowl alternately, with each player within a team bowling all their bowls, then handing over to the next player. The team captain or \"skip\" always plays last and is instrumental in directing his team's shots and tactics. The current method of scoring in the professional tour ([[World Bowls Tour]]) is sets. Each set consists of nine ends and the player with the most shots at the end of a set wins the set. If the score is tied the set is halved. If a player wins two sets, or gets a win and a tie, that player wins the game. If each player wins a set, or both sets end tied, there is a 3-end tiebreaker to determine a winner.\n\n[[Image:Swifts creek bowls club.jpg|thumb|left|[[Swifts Creek, Victoria|Swifts Creek]] Bowls Club]]\n\n==Bias of bowls==\n[[Image:Bowls&Kitty.JPG|thumb|Two bowls with club stickers. The jack/kitty is sitting in front of the bowls.]]\nBowls are designed to travel a curved path because of a weight [[bias]] which was originally produced by inserting weights in one side of the bowl. This is no longer permitted by the rules and bias is now produced entirely by the shape of the bowl. A bowler determines the bias direction of the bowl in his hand by a dimple or symbol on one side. Regulations determine the minimum bias allowed, and the range of diameters (11.6 to 13.1&nbsp;cm), but within these rules bowlers can and do choose bowls to suit their own preference. They were originally made from [[lignum vitae]], a dense wood giving rise to the term \"woods\" for bowls, but are now more typically made of a hard plastic composite material.\n\nBowls were once only available coloured black or brown but they are now available in a variety of colours. They have unique symbol markings engraved on them for identification. Since many bowls look the same, coloured, adhesive stickers or labels are also used to mark the bowls of each team in bowls matches. Some local associations agree on specific colours for stickers for each of the clubs in their area. Provincial or [[national colours]] are often assigned in national and international competitions. These stickers are used by [[officials]] to distinguish teams.\n\nBowls have symbols unique to the set of four for identification. The side of the bowl with a larger symbol within a circle indicates the side away from the bias. That side with a smaller symbol within a smaller circle is the bias side toward which the bowl will turn. It is not uncommon for players to deliver a \"wrong bias\" shot from time to time and see their carefully aimed bowl crossing neighbouring rinks rather than heading towards their jack.\n\nWhen bowling there are several types of delivery. \"Draw\" shots are those where the bowl is rolled to a specific location without causing too much disturbance of bowls already in the head. For a right-handed bowler, \"forehand draw\" or \"finger peg\" is initially aimed to the right of the jack, and curves in to the left. The same bowler can deliver a \"backhand draw\" or \"thumb peg\" by turning the bowl over in his hand and curving it the opposite way, from left to right. In both cases, the bowl is rolled as close to the jack as possible, unless tactics demand otherwise. A \"drive\" or \"fire\" or \"strike\" involves bowling with force with the aim of knocking either the jack or a specific bowl out of play - and with the drive's speed, there is virtually no noticeable (or, at least, much less) curve on the shot. An \"upshot\" or \"yard on\" shot involves delivering the bowl with an extra degree of weight (often referred to as \"controlled\" weight or \"rambler\"), enough to displace the jack or disturb other bowls in the head without killing the end. A \"block\" shot is one that is intentionally placed short to defend from a drive or to stop an oppositions draw shot. The challenge in all these shots is to be able to adjust line and length accordingly, the faster the delivery, the narrower the line or \"green\".\n\n==Variations of play==\nParticularly in team competition there can be a large number of bowls on the green towards the conclusion of the end, and this gives rise to complex tactics. Teams \"holding shot\" with the closest bowl will often make their subsequent shots not with the goal of placing the bowl near the jack, but in positions to make it difficult for opponents to get their bowls into the head, or to places where the jack might be deflected to if the opponent attempts to disturb the head.\n\n[[Image:Edgworth Bowling Green.jpg|thumb|left|A crown green at [[Edgworth, Lancashire]]]]\n\nThere are many different ways to set up the game. [[Crown green bowls|Crown Green Bowling]] utilises the entire green. A player can send the jack anywhere on the green in this game and the green itself is more akin to a golf green, with lots of undulation. It is only played with two woods each, ahd the jack also has a bias and is only slightly smaller than the woods. At the amateur level it is usual for several ends to be played simultaneously on one green. If two moving woods meet, both are taken back and the shots replayed. If a moving wood strikes a stationary wood or jack from another end, it is again taken back and replayed, but the bowl struck is replaced where contact took place. The game is played usually to 21-up in Singles and Doubles format with some competitions playing to 31-up. The Panel (Professional Crown Green Bowls) is played at the Red Lion, [[Westhoughton]] daily and is played to 41-up with greenside betting throughout play.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSingles, triples and fours and Australian pairs are some ways the game can be played. In singles, two people play against each other and the first to reach 21, 25 or 31 shots (as decided by the controlling body) is the winner. In one variation of singles play, each player uses two bowls only and the game is played over 21 ends.  A player concedes the game before the 21st end if the score difference is such that it is impossible to draw equal or win within the 21 ends. If the score is equal after 21 ends, an extra end is played to decide the winner. An additional scoring method is set play. This comprises two sets over nine ends. Should a player win a set each, they then play a further 3 ends that will decide the winner.\n\nPairs allows both people on a team to play Skip and Lead. The lead throws two bowls, the skip delivers two, then the lead delivers his remaining two, the skip then delivers his remaining two bowls. Each end, the leads and skips switch positions. This is played over 21 ends or sets play. Triples is with three players while Fours is with four players in each team and is played over 21 ends.\n\nAnother pairs variation is 242 pairs (also known as Australian Pairs). In the first end of the game the A players lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the A players complete the end with their final 2 bowls. The A players act as lead and skip in the same end. In the second end the roles are reversed with the A players being in the middle. This alternating pattern continues through the game which is typically over 15 ends.\n\n[[Short Mat Bowls]] is an all-year sport unaffected by weather conditions and it does not require a permanent location as the rink mats can be rolled up and stowed away. This makes it particularly appropriate for small communities as it can be played in village halls, schools, sports and social clubs, hotels and so on. where space is restricted and is also required for other purposes: it is even played on North Sea oil rigs where space is really at a premium.\n\nBowls are played by the blind and paraplegic. Blind bowlers are extremely skilful. A string is run out down the centre of the lane & wherever the jack lands it is moved across to the string and the length is called out by a sighted marker, when the woods are sent the distance from the jack is called out, in yards, feet and inches-the position in relation to the jack is given using the clock, 12.00 is behind the jack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbbg.co.uk/blind-bowling-explained/4534550448|title=Blind Bowling Explained - RBBG|website=www.rbbg.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Tra bowls ===\n\n[[File:Trabol.JPG|thumb|A bowls tra with bowls and spectator seats next to it.]]\n\nIn the province of [[West-Flanders]] (and surrounding regions), tra bowls is the most popular variation of bowls. As opposed to playing it on a flat or uneven terrain, the terrain is made smooth but hollow (tra just means \"hollow road\" in Flemish). The hollow road causes the path to be curving even more.\n\nThe balls are biased in the same way as the lawn bowls balls but with a diameter of about 20&nbsp;cm, a thickness of 12&nbsp;cm and a weight of about 2&nbsp;kg, they are a bit bigger than usual bowls. The target is an unmovable feather or metal plate on the ground, instead of a small ball. The length of the tra is about 18 m.\n\nThe scoring is also different, as a point is awarded for every shot that brings the ball closer to the target than any opponent's ball. This causes pure blocking strategies to be less effective.<ref>http://www.vlas.be/vlaspdf/infofolders/trabol.pdf Tra bowls information brochure</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the West-Flemish tra bowls federation was founded to uniform the local differing rules and to organise a match calendar.  Meanwhile, they also organise championships and tournaments.<ref>http://www.westvlaamsetrabolders.be Website of the West-Flemish tra bowls federation</ref>\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Merewether BC.jpg|thumb|[[Merewether]] Bowling Club, Newcastle, New South Wales]]\n[[File:Provincial juiors entry form 007.jpg|thumb|The [[Alberta]] Male Junior Champion for 2007 at Royal Lawn Bowling Club in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada]]\n\nThere is a [[World Indoor Bowls Championships]] and also [[World Bowls Events]].\n\nBowls is one of the \"core sports\" that must be included at each edition of the [[Commonwealth Games]].

Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the [[maison d'arr\u00eat]]. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of [[Jausiers]] and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Br\u00e8s, and Mayor Signoret of [[Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye]]. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in [[Maddalena Pass|L'Argenti\u00e8re]] in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).\n\nBetween 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of [[French immigration to Mexico|emigration to Mexico]]. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]] department store chain in Mexico; [[Marcelo Ebrard]], the [[List of heads of government of the Mexican Federal District|head of government of Mexico City]] from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as ''maisons mexicaines''), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930.

Following Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] (1844\u20131921), and later his great-grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]] (1897\u20131957). Bah\u00e1'\u00eds around the world annually elect local, regional, and national [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the [[Universal House of Justice]], the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community, which sits in [[Haifa]], Israel, near the [[Shrine of the B\u00e1b]].\n\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: [[God in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|God]] is considered single and all-powerful.

Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bah\u00e1'\u00ed belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical.

When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.{{sfn|Masumian|1995}}\n\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice.

They established themselves in [[Worms]], but with Roman cooperation their descendants eventually established the [[Kingdom of the Burgundians]] much further south, and within the empire, in the western Alps region where modern Switzerland, France and Italy meet. This later became a component of the Frankish empire. The name of this kingdom survives in the regional appellation, [[Burgundy]], which is a region in modern France, representing only a part of that kingdom.\n\nAnother part of the Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in the Oder-Vistula basin and formed a contingent in [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire|Hunnic]] army by 451.<ref name=Appolinarius>Sidonnius Appolinarius, ''Carmina'', 7, 322</ref><ref name=Luebe>Luebe, ''Die Burgunder'', in Kr\u00fcger II, p. 373 n. 21, in Herbert Schutz, ''Tools, weapons and ornaments: Germanic material culture in Pre-Carolingian Central Europe, 400-750'', BRILL, 2001, p.36</ref>\n\nBefore clear documentary evidence begins, the Burgundians may have originally emigrated from mainland [[Scandinavia]] to the Baltic island of [[Bornholm]], and from there to the [[Vistula]] basin, in the middle of what is now Poland.<ref name=\"EBBurgundy\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85188/Burgundy/253115/History |title=Burgundy: History |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\nThe [[ethnonym]] Burgundians is commonly used in English to refer to the ''Burgundi'' (''Burgundionei'', ''Burgundiones'' or ''Burgunds'') who settled in [[Sapaudia]] (Savoy), in the western Alps, during the 5th century. The original [[Kingdom of the Burgundians]] barely intersected the modern ''Bourgogne'' and more closely matched the boundaries of the [[Arpitan]] or [[Romand]] ([[Franco-Proven\u00e7al language|Franco-Proven\u00e7al]]) language area,<ref>Andres Kristol, \"Francoprovencal\", in ''The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, pp. 351\u20132. </ref> centred on the ''[[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes|R\u00f4no-Arpes]]'' (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes) region of France, [[Romandy]] in west Switzerland and'' [[Aosta Valley|Val d'Outa]]'' (Val d'Aosta), in north west Italy.\n\nIn modern usage, however, \"Burgundians\" can sometimes refer to later inhabitants of the geographical ''[[Bourgogne]]'' or ''Borgogne'' (Burgundy), named after the old kingdom, but not corresponding to the original boundaries of it. Between the 6th and 20th centuries, the boundaries and political connections of \"Burgundy\" have changed frequently. In modern times the only area still referred to as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] is in France, which derives its name from the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. But in the context of the middle ages the term Burgundian (or similar spellings) can refer even to the powerful political entity the Dukes controlled which included not only Burgundy itself but had actually expanded to have a strong association with areas now in modern [[Belgium]] and Southern [[Netherlands]]. The parts of the old Kingdom not within the French controlled Duchy tended to come under different names, except for the [[County of Burgundy]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:DenmarkBornholm2.png|thumb|right|220px|Location of the island of [[Bornholm]]]]\nThe Burgundians had a tradition of [[Scandinavia]]n origin which finds support in place-name evidence and archaeological evidence (Stjerna) and many consider their tradition to be correct (e.g. Musset, p.&nbsp;62). The Burgundians are believed to have then emigrated to the Baltic island of [[Bornholm]] (\"the island of the Burgundians\" in [[Old Norse]]). However, by about 250 AD, the population of Bornholm had largely disappeared from the island. Most cemeteries ceased to be used, and those that were still used had few burials (Stjerna, in Nerman 1925:176). In ''[[\u00deorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar]]'' (''The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son''), a man (or group) named [[Veseti]] settled on a [[holm (island)|holm]] (island) called ''borgundarh\u00f3lmr'' in Old Norse, i.e. Bornholm. [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of ''[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]'' uses the name ''Burgenda land'' to refer to a territory next to the land of [[Suiones|Sweons]] (\"Swedes\").<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4076 http://www.gutenberg.org]</ref> The poet and early mythologist [[Viktor Rydberg]] (1828\u20131895), (''Our Fathers' Godsaga'') asserted from an early medieval source, ''[[Sigismund of Burgundy|Vita Sigismundi]]'', that they themselves retained oral traditions about their Scandinavian origin.\n\nEarly Roman sources, such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], knew little concerning the Germanic peoples east of the Elbe river, or on the Baltic Sea. Pliny (IV.28) however mentions them among the [[Vandals|Vandalic]] or [[Eastern Germanic]] Germani peoples, including also the [[Goths]]. [[Claudius Ptolemy]] lists them as living between the Suevus (probably the [[Oder river|Oder]]) and Vistula rivers, north of the [[Lugii]], and south of the coast dwelling tribes. Around the mid 2nd century AD, there was a significant migration by Germanic tribes of Scandinavian origin ([[Rugii]], Goths, [[Gepids|Gepidae]], Vandals, Burgundians, and others)<ref name=\"TheGermansAndTheHuns\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58257/Barbarian-migrations-and-invasions |title=History of Europe: The Germans and Huns |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> towards the south-east, creating turmoil along the entire Roman frontier.<ref name=\"TheGermansAndTheHuns\"/><ref name=\"TheBarbarianInvasions\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507905/ancient-Rome/26693/The-barbarian-invasions |title=Ancient Rome: The barbarian invasions |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"GermanicPeoples\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231063/Germanic-peoples |title=Germanic peoples |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"EBGermanyAncientHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231186/Germany/58075/The-press |title=Germany: Ancient History |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> These migrations culminated in the [[Marcomannic Wars]], which resulted in widespread destruction and the first invasion of [[Italy]] in the Roman Empire period.<ref name=\"EBGermanyAncientHistory\"/> [[Jordanes]] reports that during the 3rd century, the Burgundians living in the Vistula basin were almost annihilated by [[Fastida]], king of the Gepids, whose kingdom was at the mouth of the Vistula.\n\nIn the late 3rd century, the Burgundians appear on the east bank of the Rhine, confronting Roman Gaul. [[Zosimus]] (1.68) reports them being defeated by the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] in 278 in Gaul. At this time, they were led by a Vandal king. A few years later, [[Claudius Mamertinus]] mentions them along with the [[Alamanni]], a [[Suebi]]c people. These two peoples had moved into the [[Agri Decumates]] on the eastern side of the Rhine, an area today referred to still as [[Swabia]], at times attacking Roman Gaul together and sometimes fighting each other. He also mentions that the Goths had previously defeated the Burgundians.\n\n[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], on the other hand, claimed that the Burgundians were descended from Romans. The Roman sources do not speak of any specific migration from Poland by the Burgundians (although other Vandalic peoples are more clearly mentioned as having moved west in this period), and so there have historically been some doubts about the link between the eastern and western Burgundians.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=burgundiones-geo&highlight=burgundiones |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography |year=1854| first=William |last=Smith}}</ref>\n\nIn 369/370, the Emperor [[Valentinian I]] enlisted the aid of the Burgundians in his war against the Alemanni.\n\nApproximately four decades later, the Burgundians appear again. Following [[Stilicho]]'s withdrawal of troops to fight [[Alaric I]] the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] in AD 406-408, a large group of peoples from central Europe north of the Danube, came west and crossed the Rhine, entering the Empire, near the lands of the Burgundians who had moved much earlier. The dominant groups were [[Alans]], [[Vandals]] ([[Hasdingi]] and [[Silingi]]), and Danubian [[Suevi]] (probably descended from [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]]). The majority of these Danubian peoples moved through Gaul and eventually established themselves in kingdoms in Roman Hispania. One group of Alans was settled in northern Gaul by the Romans.\n\nSome Burgundians also migrated westwards and settled as ''[[foederati]]'' in the Roman province of [[Germania Secunda]] along the [[Middle Rhine]]. Other Burgundians however remained outside the empire and apparently formed a contingent in [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire|Hunnic]] army by 451.<ref name=Appolinarius /><ref name=Luebe />\n\n===Kingdom===\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Burgundians}}\n\n====Establishment====\nIn 411, the Burgundian king [[Gunther|Gundahar]] (or ''Gundicar'') set up a puppet emperor, [[Jovinus]], in cooperation with [[Goar]], king of the [[Alans]]. With the authority of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallic emperor]] that he controlled, Gundahar settled on the left (Roman) bank of the Rhine, between the river [[Lauter (Rhine)|Lauter]] and the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]], seizing [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. Apparently as part of a truce, the Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] later officially \"granted\" them the land,<ref>Prosper, a. 386</ref> with its capital at the old Celtic Roman settlement of Borbetomagus (present [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]).\n\nDespite their new status as ''foederati'', Burgundian raids into Roman Upper [[Gallia Belgica]] became intolerable and were ruthlessly brought to an end in 436, when the Roman general [[Flavius A\u00ebtius|A\u00ebtius]] called in [[Hun]] mercenaries, who overwhelmed the Rhineland kingdom in 437. Gundahar was killed in the fighting, reportedly along with the majority of the Burgundian tribe.<ref>Prosper; ''Chronica Gallica 452''; Hydatius; and Sidonius Apollinaris</ref>\n\nThe destruction of Worms and the Burgundian kingdom by the Huns became the subject of heroic legends that were afterwards incorporated in the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''\u2014on which [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] based his [[Ring Cycle]]\u2014where King Gunther (Gundahar) and Queen [[Br\u00fcnnehilde|Br\u00fcnhild]] hold their court at Worms, and [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] comes to woo Kriemhild. (In Old Norse sources the names are ''Gunnar'', ''Brynhild'', and ''Gudr\u00fan'' as normally rendered in English.) In fact, the ''Etzel'' of the ''Nibelungenlied'' is based on [[Attila the Hun]].\n\n===Settlement in Savoy===\n[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom EN.png|thumb|right|230px|The Second Burgundian Kingdom between 443 and 476]]\nFor reasons not cited in the sources, the Burgundians were granted ''foederati'' status a second time, and in 443 were resettled by [[Flavius A\u00ebtius|A\u00ebtius]] in the region of ''Sapaudia''.<ref>''Chronica Gallica 452''</ref> Though the precise geography is uncertain, ''Sapaudia'' corresponds to the modern-day [[Savoy]], and the Burgundians probably lived near ''Lugdunum'', known today as [[Lyon]].<ref>Wood 1994, Gregory II, 9</ref> A new king, [[Gundioc]] or ''Gunderic'', presumed to be Gundahar's son, appears to have reigned following his father's death.<ref>Drew, p.&nbsp;1</ref> The historian Pline{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} tells us that Gonderic ruled the areas of Sa\u00f4ne, Dauphiny, Savoie and a part of Provence. He set up [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]] as the capital of the kingdom of Burgundy. In all, eight Burgundian kings of the house of Gundahar ruled until the kingdom was overrun by the Franks in 534.\n\nAs allies of Rome in its last decades, the Burgundians fought alongside A\u00ebtius and a confederation of Visigoths and others in the battle against [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] (also called \"The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields\") in 451. The alliance between Burgundians and Visigoths seems to have been strong, as Gundioc and his brother Chilperic I accompanied [[Theodoric II]] to Spain to fight the Sueves in 455.<ref>Jordanes, ''Getica'', 231</ref>\n\n====Aspirations to the empire====\nAlso in 455, an ambiguous reference ''infidoque tibi Burdundio ductu''<ref>[[Sidonius Apollinaris]] in ''Panegyr. Avit''. 442.</ref> implicates an unnamed treacherous Burgundian leader in the murder of the emperor [[Petronius Maximus]] in the chaos preceding the sack of Rome by the [[Vandals]]. The Patrician [[Ricimer]] is also blamed; this event marks the first indication of the link between the Burgundians and Ricimer, who was probably Gundioc's brother-in-law and [[Gundobad]]'s uncle.<ref>John Malalas, 374</ref>\n\nIn 456, the Burgundians, apparently confident in their growing power, negotiated a territorial expansion and power sharing arrangement with the local Roman senators.<ref>Marius of Avenches</ref>\n\nIn 457, Ricimer overthrew another emperor, [[Avitus]], raising [[Majorian]] to the throne. This new emperor proved unhelpful to Ricimer and the Burgundians. The year after his ascension, Majorian stripped the Burgundians of the lands they had acquired two years earlier. After showing further signs of independence, he was murdered by Ricimer in 461.\n\nTen years later, in 472, Ricimer\u2013who was by now the son-in-law of the Western Emperor [[Anthemius]]\u2013was plotting with Gundobad to kill his father-in-law; Gundobad beheaded the emperor (apparently personally).<ref>''Chronica Gallica 511''; John of Antioch, fr. 209; Jordanes, ''Getica'', 239</ref> Ricimer then appointed [[Olybrius]]; both died, surprisingly of natural causes, within a few months. Gundobad seems then to have succeeded his uncle as Patrician and king-maker, and raised [[Glycerius]] to the throne.<ref>Marius of Avenches; John of Antioch, fr. 209</ref>\n\nIn 474, Burgundian influence over the empire seems to have ended. Glycerius was deposed in favor of [[Julius Nepos]], and Gundobad returned to Burgundy, presumably at the death of his father Gundioc. At this time or shortly afterwards, the Burgundian kingdom was divided among Gundobad and his brothers, Godigisel, Chilperic II, and Gundomar I.<ref>Gregory, II, 28</ref>\n\n====Consolidation of the kingdom====\n[[File:Conquests of Clovis.png|thumbnail|Kingdom of the Burgundians in around 500]]\nAccording to [[Gregory of Tours]], the years following Gundobad's return to Burgundy saw a bloody consolidation of power. Gregory states that Gundobad murdered his brother Chilperic, drowning his wife and exiling their daughters (one of whom was to become the wife of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] the [[Franks|Frank]], and was reputedly responsible for his conversion).<ref>Gregory, II, 28. Gregory's chronology of the events surrounding Clovis and Gundobad has been questioned by Bury, Shanzer, and Wood, among others. Gregory was somewhat of a Frankish apologist, and commonly discredited the enemies of Clovis by attributing to them some fairly shocking acts. As with Godegisel, he also commonly refers to the treachery of Clovis' allies, when in fact Clovis seems to have bought them off (e.g., in the case of the Ripuarians).</ref> This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregory's chronology for the events.\n\nIn c. 500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisel's and Clovis' forces \"crushed the army of Gundobad\".<ref>Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32</ref> Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death. From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy.<ref>e.g., Gregory, II, 33</ref> This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.\n\nEither Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis' earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over [[Alaric II]] the Visigoth.\n\nDuring the upheaval, sometime between 483\u2013501, Gundobad began to set forth the ''Lex Gundobada'' (see below), issuing roughly the first half, which drew upon the ''Lex Visigothorum''.<ref>Drew, p.&nbsp;1</ref> Following his consolidation of power, between 501 and his death in 516, Gundobad issued the second half of his law, which was more originally Burgundian.\n\n====Fall====\n[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom 2 EN.png|thumb|right|230px|Burgundy as part of the Frankish Empire between 534 and 843]]\n\nThe Burgundians were extending their power over southeastern [[Gaul]]--that is, northern Italy, western Switzerland, and southeastern France. In 493, [[Clovis I|Clovis]], king of the Franks, married the Burgundian princess [[Clotilde|Clotilda]] (daughter of Chilperic), who converted him to the Catholic faith.\n\nAt first allied with [[Clovis I|Clovis']] [[Franks]] against the [[Visigoths]] in the early 6th century, the Burgundians were eventually conquered at [[Battle of Autun (532)|Autun]] by the Franks in 532 after a first attempt in the [[Battle of V\u00e9zeronce]]. The Burgundian kingdom was made part of the [[Merovingian]] kingdoms, and the Burgundians themselves were by and large absorbed as well.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nThe 5th century [[Gallo-Roman]] [[poet]] and [[landowner]] [[Sidonius Apollinaris|Sidonius]], who at one point lived with the Burgundians, described them as a long-haired people of immense physical size:{{quote| \"Why... do you [an obscure senator by the name of Catullinus] bid me compose a song dedicated to Venus... placed as I am among long-haired hordes, having to endure Germanic speech, praising often with a wry face the song of the gluttonous Burgundian who spreads rancid butter on his hair? ...

It appears to have become extinct during the late sixth century.<ref name=Lockwood>W.B. Lockwood, \"A Panorama of Indo-European Languages\"</ref>\n\nLittle is known of the language. Some proper names of Burgundians are recorded, and some words used in the area in modern times are thought to be derived from the ancient Burgundian language,<ref name=Lockwood/> but it is often difficult to distinguish these from Germanic words of other origin, and in any case the modern form of the words is rarely suitable to infer much about the form in the old language.\n\n==Religion==\nSomewhere in the east the Burgundians had converted to the [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]] from earlier [[Germanic paganism]]. Their Arianism proved a source of suspicion and distrust between the Burgundians and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Western Roman Empire]].\n\nDivisions were evidently healed or healing circa 500, however, as [[Gundobad]], one of the last Burgundian kings, maintained a close personal friendship with [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienne|bishop of Vienne]]. Moreover, Gundobad's son and successor, [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]], was himself a Catholic, and there is evidence that many of the Burgundian people had converted by this time as well, including several female members of the ruling family.\n\n==Law==\nThe Burgundians left three [[legal code]]s, among the earliest from any of the Germanic tribes.\n\nThe '''Liber Constitutionum sive Lex Gundobada''' (\"The Book of Constitutions or Law of Gundobad\"), also known as the ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', or more simply the ''Lex Gundobada'' or the ''Liber'', was issued in several parts between 483 and 516, principally by Gundobad, but also by his son, Sigismund.<ref>Drew, p.&nbsp;6\u20137</ref> It was a record of Burgundian customary law and is typical of the many Germanic law codes from this period. In particular, the ''Liber'' borrowed from the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]''<ref>Drew, p.&nbsp;6</ref> and influenced the later ''[[Lex Ripuaria]]''.<ref>Rivers, p.&nbsp;9</ref> The ''Liber'' is one of the primary sources for contemporary Burgundian life, as well as the history of its kings.\n\nLike many of the Germanic tribes, the Burgundians' legal traditions allowed the application of separate laws for separate ethnicities. Thus, in addition to the ''Lex Gundobada'', Gundobad also issued (or codified) a set of laws for Roman subjects of the Burgundian kingdom, the ''Lex Romana Burgundionum'' (''The Roman Law of the Burgundians'').\n\nIn addition to the above codes, Gundobad's son Sigismund later published the ''Prima Constitutio''.<!--''\u2013I have been unable to find a source for this \u2013[[User:Ryanmcdaniel|Ryan McDaniel]]'' -->\n\n{{Expand French|Burgondes|date=March 2013|topic = culture}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Nibelung]] (later legends of the Burgundian kings).\n* [[List of kings of Burgundy]]\n* [[Duchy of Burgundy]]\n* [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]\n* [[Dauphin\u00e9]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples and tribes]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* Bury, J.B.

The player who completes the fourth side of a 1\u00d71 box earns one point and takes another turn.

The second player (B) plays the mirror image of the first player's move, hoping to divide the board into two pieces and tie the game. But the first player (A) makes a ''sacrifice'' at move 7 and B accepts the sacrifice, getting one box. However, B must now add another line, and connects the center dot to the center-right dot, causing the remaining boxes to be joined together in a ''chain'' (shown at the end of move 8). With A's next move, player A gets them all and wins 3\u20131.\n\n== Strategy ==\n[[File:dots-and-boxes-chains.png|thumb|upright=1.35|'''The double-cross strategy''': faced with position 1, a novice player would create position 2 and lose. An experienced player would create position 3 and win.]]\nFor most novice players, the game begins with a phase of more-or-less randomly connecting dots, where the only strategy is to avoid adding the third side to any box. This continues until all the remaining (potential) boxes are joined together into ''chains'' \u2013 groups of one or more adjacent boxes in which any move gives all the boxes in the chain to the opponent. At this point, players typically take all available boxes, then ''open'' the smallest available chain to their opponent. For example, a novice player faced with a situation like position 1 in the diagram on the right, in which some boxes can be captured, may take all the boxes in the chain, resulting in position 2. But, with their last move, they have to open the next, larger chain, and the novice loses the game.<ref name=\"ww\"/><ref name=\"west\">{{Citation\n | last = West\n | first = Julian\n | contribution = Championship-level play of dots-and-boxes\n | editor-last = Nowakowski\n | editor-first = Richard\n | title = Games of No Chance\n | pages = 79\u201384\n | publisher = MSRI Publications\n | place = Berkeley\n | year = 1996\n | contribution-url = http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/westboxes.pdf }}.</ref>\n\nA more ''experienced'' player faced with position 1 will instead play the ''double-cross strategy'', taking all but 2 of the boxes in the chain and leaving position 3. The opponent will take these two boxes and then be forced to open the next chain. By achieving position 3, player A wins. The same double-cross strategy applies no matter how many long chains there are: a player using this strategy will take all but two boxes in each chain and take all the boxes in the last chain. If the chains are long enough, then this player will win.\n\nThe next level of strategic complexity, between ''experts'' who would both use the double-cross strategy (if they were allowed to), is a battle for ''control'':  An expert player tries to force their opponent ''to open the first long chain'', because the player who first opens a long chain usually loses.<ref name=\"ww\"/><ref name=\"west\" />  Against a player who does not understand the concept of a sacrifice, the expert simply has to make the correct number of sacrifices to encourage the opponent to hand him the first chain long enough to ensure a win.  ''If'' the other player also sacrifices, the expert has to additionally manipulate the number of available sacrifices through earlier play.\n\nIn [[combinatorial game theory]], dots and boxes is an [[impartial game]] and many positions can be analyzed using [[Sprague\u2013Grundy theorem|Sprague\u2013Grundy theory]]. However, Dots and Boxes lacks the [[normal play convention]] of most impartial games (where the last player to move wins), which complicates the analysis considerably.<ref name=\"ww\"/><ref name=\"west\" />\n\n== Unusual grids and variants ==\nDots and Boxes need not be played on a rectangular grid \u2013  it can be played on a triangular grid or a hexagonal grid.<ref name=\"ww\"/> There is also a variant in [[Bolivia]] where it is played in a [[chakana]] or Inca cross grid, which adds more complications to the game.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\nDots and Boxes has a [[dual graph]] form called \"Strings-and-Coins\".  This game is played on a network of coins (vertices) joined by strings (edges).  Players take turns cutting a string.  When a cut leaves a coin with no strings, the player \"pockets\" the coin and takes another turn.  The winner is the player who pockets the most coins.  Strings-and-Coins can be played on an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].<ref name=\"ww\"/>\n\nA variant called Trxilt combines some elements of Dots and Boxes with some elements of chess.\n\nA variant [[Kropki]] played in Poland allows a player to claim a region of several squares as soon as its boundary is completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zagram.org/kropki-zasady.html|title=Dots - rules of the game|last=Grzegorzka|first=Jakub|last2=Dyda|date=|website=zagram.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref> In the Netherlands, it is called \"kamertje verhuren\" (\"Rent-a-Room\") and the outer border already has lines.{{cn|date=April 2016}} In analyses of Dots and Boxes, starting with outer lines is called a ''Swedish board'' while the standard version is called an ''American board''.

In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant [[surveillance]] by the authorities, mainly by [[telescreen]]s (with the exception of the [[Proles]]). The people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan \"Big Brother is watching you\": a maxim that is ubiquitously on display.\n\nIn modern culture, the term \"Big Brother\" has entered the [[lexicon]] as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to [[civil liberties]], often specifically related to [[mass surveillance]].\n\n== Purported origins ==\nIn the essay section of his novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]] states that Orwell got the idea for the name of Big Brother from advertising [[billboard]]s for educational [[correspondence course]]s from a company called Bennett's during [[World War II]]. The original posters showed [[J. M. Bennett]] himself, a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase \"Let me be your father\" attached. According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanor) with the text \"Let me be your big brother\".\n\nAdditional speculation from [[Douglas Kellner]] of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argued that Big Brother represents [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html |title=Douglas Kellner, George F. Kneller Philosophy of Education Chair, UCLA |work=ucla.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224448/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html |archivedate=9 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf|title=From 1984 to One-Dimensional Man: Critical Reflections on Orwell and Marcuse|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829021052/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another theory is that the inspiration for Big Brother was [[Brendan Bracken]], the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] until 1945. Orwell worked under Bracken on the [[BBC]]'s Indian Service. Bracken was customarily referred to by his employees by his initials, B.B., the same initials as the character Big Brother. Orwell also resented the wartime censorship and need to manipulate information which he felt came from the highest levels of the Minister of Information and from Bracken's office in particular.\n\n== Appearance inside the novel ==\n=== Existence ===\n[[File:Telescreen.png|thumb|250px|Big Brother's face looms from giant telescreens in Victory Square]]\nIn the novel, it is never made clear whether Big Brother is or had been a real person, or is a [[National personification|fictional personification]] of [[Ingsoc|the Party]], similar to [[Britannia]] and [[Uncle Sam]]. Big Brother is described as appearing on posters and telescreens as a man in his mid-40s. In Party propaganda, Big Brother is presented as one of the founders of the Party, along with [[Emmanuel Goldstein|Goldstein]].\n\nAt one point, [[Winston Smith]], the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries \"to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London\".\n\nIn the book ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'', read by Winston Smith and purportedly written by Goldstein, Big Brother is referred to as infallible and all-powerful. No one has ever seen him and there is a reasonable certainty that he will never die. He is simply \"the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world\" since the emotions of love, fear and reverence are more easily focused on an individual (if only a face on the hoardings and a voice on the telescreens) than an organisation. When Winston Smith is later arrested, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] repeats that Big Brother will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as \"the embodiment of the Party\" and says that he will exist as long as the Party exists. When Winston asks \"Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?\" (meaning is Big Brother an actual human being), O'Brien replies \"You do not exist\" (meaning that Smith is now an [[unperson]]; an example of [[doublethink]]).\n\n=== Cult of personality ===\nA spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother (\"BB\") is illustrated at the end of the \"[[Two Minutes Hate]]\": {{quote|At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! . . . B-B! . . . B-B!'\u2014over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second\u2014a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.  For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.  It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.  Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.<ref>Orwell, George (1949). Nineteen Eighty-Four.</ref>}}\n\nThough Oceania's [[Ministry of Truth]], [[Ministry of Plenty]] and [[Ministry of Peace]] each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the [[Ministry of Love]] is perhaps the most straightforward as \"rehabilitated thought criminals\" leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into adoring (loving) Big Brother, hence its name.\n\n=== Big Brother salute ===\nLike the [[Nazi salute]], Ingsoc has its own salute to Big Brother, which consists of crossing one's arms above the head during [[Two Minutes Hate]]s and [[Hate week]]s, showing loyalty to Big Brother and the Party. Note that it is only mentioned and shown in the movie adaptation of the novel.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Global surveillance}}\n[[File:Plaza George Orwell, Barcelona..jpg|thumb|left|[[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] in [[George Orwell]] Square in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\nSince the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the phrase \"Big Brother\" has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure and attempts by government to increase surveillance. Big Brother and other [[Orwellian]] imagery are often referenced in the joke known as the [[Russian reversal]].\n\nThe magazine ''Book'' ranked Big Brother No. 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900 list.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christine Paik |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html |title=100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 |publisher=NPR |date=19 March 2002 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref> ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref>\n\nThe worldwide reality television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant [[surveillance]]. In 2000, after the [[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|United States version]] of the [[CBS]] program ''Big Brother'' premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company Orwell Productions, Inc. in federal court in Chicago for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was ''Estate of Orwell v. CBS'', 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' \"mutual satisfaction\", but the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission.

Although specialized [[data structures]] designed for fast searching, such as [[hash tables]], can be searched more efficiently, binary search applies to a wider range of problems.\n\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, [[fractional cascading]] speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in [[computational geometry]] and in numerous other fields. [[Exponential search]] extends binary search to unbounded lists. The [[binary search tree]] and [[B-tree]] data structures are based on binary search.\n\n== Algorithm ==\nBinary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm B\"}}\n\n===Procedure===\nGiven an array <math>A</math> of <math>n</math> elements with values or [[Record (computer science)|records]] <math>A_0,A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_{n-1}</math>sorted such that <math>A_0 \\leq A_1 \\leq A_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq A_{n-1}</math>, and target value <math>T</math>, the following [[subroutine]] uses binary search to find the index of <math>T</math> in <math>A</math>.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm B\"}}\n# Set <math>L</math> to <math>0</math> and <math>R</math> to <math>n-1</math>.\n# If <math>L>R</math>, the search terminates as unsuccessful.\n# Set <math>m</math> (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>.\n# If <math>A_m < T</math>, set <math>L</math> to <math>m+1</math> and go to step 2.\n# If <math>A_m > T</math>, set <math>R</math> to <math>m-1</math> and go to step 2.\n# Now <math>A_m = T</math>, the search is done; return <math>m</math>.\n\nThis iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables <math>L</math> and <math>R</math>.

For example, if the array to be searched was <math>[1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7]</math> and the target was <math>4</math>, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element if the target value is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if an element is duplicated in the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"History and bibliography\"}}\n\n==== Procedure for finding the leftmost element ====\nTo find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:{{Sfn|Kasahara|Morishita|2006|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n# Set <math>L</math> to <math>0</math> and <math>R</math> to <math>n</math>.\n# If <math>L \\geq R</math>, go to step 6.\n# Set <math>m</math> (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to <math>\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>\n# If <math>A_m < T</math>, set <math>L</math> to <math>m+1</math> and go to step 2.\n# Otherwise, if <math>A_m \\geq T</math>, set ''<math>R</math>'' to <math>m</math> and go to step 2.\n# Now <math>L=R</math>, the search is done, return <math>L</math>.\n\nIf <math>L < n</math> and <math>A_L = T</math>, then <math>A_L</math> is the leftmost element that equals <math>T</math>.

However, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches because binary search operates on sorted arrays. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and [[Nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]]. [[Range query (data structures)|Range queries]] seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.{{sfn|Sedgewick|Wayne|2011|loc=\u00a73.1, subsection \"Rank and selection\"}}\n* Rank queries can be performed with the [[#Procedure for finding the leftmost element|procedure for finding the leftmost element]].

This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.{{sfn|Sedgewick|Wayne|2011|loc=\u00a73.1, subsection \"Range queries\"}}\n\n==Performance==\n[[File:Binary search example tree.svg|thumb|A [[Tree (data structure)|tree]] representing binary search.

The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration. This represents the successive elimination of elements.<ref name=\"FloresMadpis1971\" />{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nIn the worst case, binary search makes <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) + 1 \\rfloor</math> iterations of the comparison loop, where the <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\  \\rfloor</math> notation denotes the [[floor function]] that yields the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument, and <math display=\"inline\">\\log_2</math> is the [[binary logarithm]]. The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary search that has reduced to one element and always eliminates the smaller subarray out of the two in each iteration if they are not of equal size.{{Efn|This happens as binary search will not always divide the array perfectly. Take for example the array {{math|[1, 2, ..., 16]}}. The first iteration will select the midpoint of 8. On the left subarray are eight elements, but on the right are nine. If the search takes the right path, there is a higher chance that the search will make the maximum number of comparisons.{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}}}{{sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\nThe worst case may also be reached when the target element is not in the array.

The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely.{{Efn|Any search algorithm based solely on comparisons can be represented using a binary comparison tree. An ''internal path'' is any path from the root to an existing node. Let <math>I</math> be the ''internal path length'', the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case is <math>1 + \\frac{I}{n}</math> or simply one plus the average of all the internal path lengths of the tree. This is because internal paths represent the elements that the search algorithm compares to the target. The lengths of these internal paths represent the number of iterations ''after'' the root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path length <math>I</math> must be minimized. It turns out that the tree for binary search minimizes the internal path length. {{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} proved that the ''external path'' length (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path length <math>I</math> is linearly related to external path length <math>E</math>. For any tree of <math>n</math> nodes, <math>I = E - 2n</math>. When each subtree has a similar number of nodes, or equivalently the array is divided into halves in each iteration, the external nodes as well as their interior parent nodes lie within two levels. It follows that binary search minimizes the number of average comparisons as its comparison tree has the lowest possible internal path length.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}}} Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over ''all'' elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Further analysis of binary search\"}}\n\n=== Performance of alternative procedure ===\nEach iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only <math display=\"inline\">\\lfloor \\log_2 (n) + 1 \\rfloor</math> times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but enormous <math display=\"inline\">n</math>.{{Efn|{{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} showed on his [[MIX]] computer model, intended to represent an ordinary computer, that the average running time of this variation for a successful search is <math display=\"inline\">17.5 \\log_2 n + 17</math> units of time compared to <math display=\"inline\">18 \\log_2 n - 16</math> units for regular binary search.

For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as [[van Emde Boas tree]]s, [[fusion tree]]s, [[trie]]s, and [[bit array]]s. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.<ref name=\"pred\" /> As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.<ref name=\"judyarray\" />\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Uniform binary search===\n[[File:Uniform binary search.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Uniform binary search]] stores the difference between the current and the two next possible middle elements instead of specific bounds.]]\n{{main|Uniform binary search}}\nUniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the index of the middle element and the change in the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. Each step reduces the change by about half. For example, if the array to be searched is <math>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]</math>, the middle element would be <math>6</math>. Uniform binary search works on the basis that the difference between the index of middle element of the array and the left and right subarrays is the same. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray (<math>[1,2,3,4,5]</math>) is <math>3</math> and the middle element of the right subarray (<math>[7,8,9,10,11]</math>) is <math>9</math>. Uniform binary search would store the value of <math>3</math> as both indices differ from <math>6</math> by this same amount.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"An important variation\"}} To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the middle element. The main advantage of uniform binary search is that the procedure can store a table of the differences between indices for each iteration of the procedure. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on [[decimal computer]]s.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Algorithm U\"}}\n\n===Exponential search{{anchor|One-sided search}}===\n[[File:Exponential search.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Visualization of [[Exponential search|exponential searching]] finding the upper bound for the subsequent binary search]]\n{{main|Exponential search}}\nExponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists.

For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Interpolation search\"}} When the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, it makes <math display=\"inline\">O(\\log \\log n)</math> comparisons.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Interpolation search\"}}{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\u00a76.2.1 (\"Searching an ordered table\"), subsection \"Exercise 22\"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perl|first1=Yehoshua|last2=Itai|first2=Alon|last3=Avni|first3=Haim|title=Interpolation search\u2014a log log ''n'' search|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|date=1978|volume=21|issue=7|pages=550\u2013553|doi=10.1145/359545.359557|bibcode=1985CACM...28...22S}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation.

In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, or in the case of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place.

[[computer network]], in which all [[node (networking)|node]]s can reach each other by [[broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] at the [[data link layer]]. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.\n\nIn terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same [[Ethernet]] [[repeater]] or [[network switch|switch]] is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. [[Router (computing)|Router]]s and other [[Network layer|higher-layer]] devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.\n\nThis is as compared to a [[collision domain]], which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.\n\nWhile some [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]] devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating [[virtual LAN|VLANs]] divides broadcast domains as well.\n\n== Further explanation ==\n\nThe distinction between broadcast and collision domains comes about because simple [[Ethernet]] and similar systems use a shared [[transmission system]]. In simple Ethernet (without switches or [[network bridge|bridges]]), [[Frame (networking)|data frames]] are transmitted to all other nodes on a network. Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame, and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own [[MAC address]] or the [[broadcast address]].\n\nSwitches act as buffers, receiving and analyzing the frames from each connected network segment. Frames destined for nodes connected to the originating segment are not forwarded by the switch. Frames destined for a specific node on a different segment are sent only to that segment. Only broadcast frames are forwarded to all other segments. This reduces unnecessary traffic and collisions.\n\nIn such a switched network, transmitted frames may not be received by all other reachable nodes. Nominally, only broadcast frames will be received by all other nodes. Collisions are localized to the network segment they occur on. Thus, the broadcast domain is the entire inter-connected [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]], and the segments connected to each switch/bridge port are each a collision domain.\n\nNot all network systems or media feature broadcast/collision domains. For example, [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP links]].\n\n==Broadcast domain control==\n\nWith a sufficiently sophisticated switch, it is possible to create a network in which the normal notion of a broadcast domain is strictly controlled. One implementation of this concept is termed a \"[[private VLAN]]\". Another implementation is possible with [[Linux]] and [[iptables]]. One helpful analogy is that by creating multiple VLANs, the number of broadcast domains increases, but the size of each broadcast domain decreases. This is because a [[virtual LAN]] (or VLAN) is technically a broadcast domain.\n\nThis is achieved by designating one or more \"[[server (computing)|server]]\" or \"provider\" nodes, either by MAC address or switch port. Broadcast frames are allowed to originate from these sources, and are sent to all other nodes. Broadcast frames from all other sources are directed only to the server/provider nodes. Traffic from other sources not destined to the server/provider nodes (\"[[peer-to-peer]]\" traffic) is blocked.\n\nThe result is a network based on a nominally shared transmission system; like Ethernet, but in which \"[[client (computing)|client]]\" nodes cannot communicate with each other, only with the server/provider. A common application is [[Internet service provider|Internet providers]]. Allowing direct data link layer communication between customer nodes exposes the network to various security attacks, such as [[ARP spoofing]]. Controlling the broadcast domain in this fashion provides many of the advantages of a point-to-point network, using commodity broadcast-based hardware.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Network layer]]\n* [[Collision domain]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://study-ccna.com/collision-broadcast-domain Collision & broadcast domain], Study CCNA\n*[http://ciscoskills.net/2011/03/30/collision-domains-vs-broadcast-domains/ Collision Domains vs. Broadcast Domains], ciscoskills.net\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqAYJZQPP2Y Broadcast Domain Explained]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broadcast Domain}}\n[[Category:Network architecture]]", "sha1": "0zdneoajcbq20jvxttcszbdejwmjdm0"}}, {"title": "Beechcraft", "ns": "0", "id": "4282", "revision": {"id": "865430626", "parentid": "865393454", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T22:13:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "BilCat", "id": "2043601"}, "comment": "Undid revision 865393454 by [[Special:Contributions/Txtav marketing|Txtav marketing]] ([[User talk:Txtav marketing|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox company\n| name             = Beechcraft Corporation\n| logo             = Beechcraft_logo.svg\n| caption          =\n| trading_name     = <!-- d/b/a/, doing business as - if different from legal name above -->\n| former type      = \n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| traded_as        = \n| industry         = [[General aviation]]\n| genre            = <!-- Only used with media and publishing companies -->\n| fate             = \n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| foundation       = 1932 <!-- City, Country ({{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}}) -->\n| founders          = [[Walter Herschel Beech|Walter Beech]], [[Olive Ann Beech]], [[Ted A.

With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic [[Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing]], which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 270 manufactured for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nBeechcraft was not Beech's first company, as he had previously formed [[Travel Air]] in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech became President of the Curtiss-Wright's airplane division and VP of sales, but became dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production and quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the Travel Air name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15, and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Beech Aircraft Corporation ad Model 17 \"Staggerwing\" 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for Model 17 \"Staggerwing\" 1937]]\n\nIn 1942 Beech won its first [[Army-Navy \"E\" Award]] production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the [[Beechcraft Model 18]] which remains in widespread use worldwide.

There was disagreement among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|U.S. Joint Chiefs]] over two proposed strategies to defeat the Japanese Empire. The strategy proposed by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called for the recapture of the [[Philippines]], followed by the capture of [[Okinawa]], then an [[Operation Downfall|attack on the Japanese mainland]]. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] favored a more direct strategy of bypassing the Philippines, but seizing Okinawa and Taiwan as [[staging area]]s to an attack on the Japanese mainland, followed by the future invasion of Japan's southernmost islands. Both strategies included the invasion of Peleliu, but for different reasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Peleliu|url=http://www.history.com/topics/battle-of-peleliu|work=History Channel|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] had already been chosen to make the assault. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] traveled to [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to personally meet both commanders and hear their arguments. MacArthur's strategy was chosen. However, before MacArthur could retake the Philippines, the [[Palau Islands]], specifically Peleliu and [[Angaur]], were to be neutralized and an airfield built to protect MacArthur's right flank.\n\n==Preparations==\n===Japanese===\n{{unref|section|date=September 2018}}\nBy 1944, Peleliu Island was occupied by about 11,000 Japanese of the [[14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|14th Infantry Division]] with Korean and [[Okinawa]]n laborers. Colonel [[Kunio Nakagawa]], commander of the division's 2nd Regiment, led the preparations for the island's defense.\n\nAfter their losses in the [[Solomon Islands campaign|Solomons]], [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts, Marshalls]] and [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] assembled a research team to develop new island-defense tactics. They chose to abandon the old strategy of stopping the enemy at the beach. The new tactics would only disrupt the landings at the water's edge and depend on an in-depth defense farther inland. Colonel Nakagawa used the rough terrain to his advantage, by constructing a system of heavily fortified bunkers, caves and underground positions all interlocked into a \"honeycomb\" system. The old \"[[banzai charge]]\" attack was also discontinued as being both wasteful of men and ineffective. These changes would force the Americans into a [[war of attrition]] requiring increasingly more resources.\n\n[[File:Peleliu-defense-194409.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese fortifications]]\nNakagawa's defenses were based at Peleliu's highest point, Umurbrogol Mountain, a collection of hills and steep ridges located at the center of Peleliu overlooking a large portion of the island, including the crucial airfield. The Umurbrogol contained some 500 limestone caves, interconnected by tunnels. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout central Peleliu, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking [[interior lines]].\n\nThe Japanese were well armed with [[Type 97 81 mm infantry mortar|{{convert|81|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] and [[Type 96 150 mm Infantry Mortar|{{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} mortar]]s and [[Type 98 20 mm AA Machine Cannon|{{convert|20|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] [[Autocannon|cannon]]s, backed by a light tank unit and an anti-aircraft detachment.\n\nThe Japanese also used the beach terrain to their advantage. The northern end of the landing beaches faced a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} coral promontory that overlooked the beaches from a small peninsula, a spot later known to the Marines who assaulted it simply as \"The Point\". Holes were blasted into the ridge to accommodate a [[Type 1 47 mm Anti-Tank Gun|{{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} gun]], and six 20 mm cannons. The positions were then sealed shut, leaving just a small firing slit to assault the beaches. Similar positions were crafted along the {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of landing beaches.\n\nThe beaches were also filled with thousands of obstacles for the landing craft, principally mines and a large number of heavy artillery shells buried with the fuses exposed to explode when they were run over. A battalion was placed along the beach to defend against the landing, but they were meant to merely delay the inevitable American advance inland.\n\n===American===\n\nUnlike the Japanese, who drastically altered their tactics for the upcoming battle, the American invasion plan was unchanged from that of previous amphibious landings, even after suffering 3,000 casualties and two months of delaying tactics against the entrenched Japanese defenders at the [[Battle of Biak]].<ref>Alexander, ''Storm Landings'', p. 110.</ref> On Peleliu, American planners chose to land on the southwest beaches because of their proximity to the airfield on South Peleliu. The [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Marine Regiment]], commanded by Colonel [[Chesty Puller|Lewis B. Puller]], was to land on the northern end of the beaches. The [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marine Regiment]], under Colonel [[Harold D. Harris]], would land in the center, and the [[7th Marine Regiment (United States)|7th Marine Regiment]], under Col. [[Herman Hanneken|Herman H. Hanneken]], would land at the southern end.\n\nThe division's artillery regiment, the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]] under Col. [[William H. Harrison (USMC)|William H. Harrison]], would land after the [[infantry]] regiments. The plan was for the 1st and 7th Marines to push inland, guarding the 5th Marines left and right flank, and allowing them to capture the airfield located directly to the center of the landing beaches. The 5th Marines were to push to the eastern shore, cutting the island in half. The 1st Marines would push north into the Umurbrogol, while the 7th Marines would clear the southern end of the island. Only one battalion was left behind in reserve, with the U.S. Army's 81st Infantry Division available for support from Angaur, just south of Peleliu.\n\nOn September 4, the Marines shipped off from their station on [[Pavuvu]], just north of [[Guadalcanal]], a {{convert|2100|mi|km|adj=on}} trip across the Pacific to Peleliu. A U.S. Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]] went in first to clear the beaches of obstacles, while [[United States Navy|Navy]] warships began their pre-invasion bombardment of Peleliu on September 12.\n\nThe [[battleship]]s {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|2}}, [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}, {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, and [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Cleveland|CL-55|2}}, {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}},<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|29}} led by the command ship {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7|2}}, subjected the tiny island, only {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size, to a massive three-day bombardment, pausing only to permit air strikes from the three [[aircraft carrier]]s, five [[light aircraft carrier]]s, and eleven [[escort carrier]]s with the attack force.<ref name= Hastings>Hastings, '' Retribution'', pp. 236-244.</ref> A total of 519 rounds of {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells, 1,845 rounds of {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells and 1,793 {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs were dropped on the islands during this period.\n\nThe Americans believed the bombardment to be successful, as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Jesse Oldendorf]] claimed that the Navy had run out of targets.<ref name= Hastings/> In reality, the majority of the Japanese positions were completely unharmed. Even the battalion left to defend the beaches was virtually unscathed. During the assault, the island's defenders exercised unusual firing discipline to avoid giving away their positions. The bombardment managed only to destroy Japan's aircraft on the island, as well as the buildings surrounding the airfield. The Japanese remained in their fortified positions, ready to attack the American landing troops.\n\n==Battle==\n===Landing===\n[[File:Battle of Peleliu map.jpg|thumb|250px|Routes of Allied landings on Peleliu, 15 September 1944]]\n\nU.S. Marines landed on Peleliu at 08:32, on September 15, the 1st Marines to the north on White Beach 1 and 2 and the 5th and 7th Marines to the center and south on Orange Beach 1, 2, and 3.<ref name=Moran>Moran, J. and Rottman, G.L., 2002, Peleliu 1944, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1841765120}}</ref>{{rp|42\u201345}} As the other landing craft approached the beaches, the Marines were caught in a crossfire when the Japanese opened the steel doors guarding their positions and fired artillery. The positions on the coral promontories guarding each flank fired on the Marines with 47 mm guns and 20 mm cannons. By 09:30, the Japanese had destroyed 60 [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s and [[DUKW]]s.\n[[File:Orange Beach 2 - Peleliu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marines]] on Orange Beach]]\n\nThe 1st Marines were quickly bogged down by heavy fire from the extreme left flank and a 30-foot-high coral ridge, \"The Point\".<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|49}} Colonel [[Chesty Puller]] narrowly escaped death when a dud high velocity artillery round struck his LVT.

Their biggest push in the south moved {{convert|1|mi|km}} inland, but the 1st Marines to the north made very little progress because of the extremely thick resistance.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|42}} The Marines had suffered 200 dead and 900 wounded.

Further complicating the situation, the Marines' water was distributed in empty oil drums, contaminating the water with the oil residue.<ref name=Hough_94/> Still, by the eighth day the 5th and 7th Marines had accomplished their objectives, holding the airfield and the southern portion of the island, although the airfield remained under threat of sustained Japanese fire from the heights of Umurbrogol Mountain until the end of the battle.<ref name= Hastings/>\n\nAmerican forces put the airfield to use on the third day. [[L-2 Grasshopper]]s from [[VMO-1]] began [[Aerial observer|aerial spotting]] missions for Marine artillery and [[naval gunfire support]]. On September 26 (D+11), Marine [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]]s from [[VMF-114]] landed on the airstrip. The Corsairs began [[dive-bombing]] missions across Peleliu, firing rockets into open cave entrances for the infantrymen, and dropping [[napalm]]; it was only the second time the latter weapon had been used in the Pacific.{{Citation needed|reason=Statistical claim re: napalm needs support|date=December 2016}} Napalm proved useful, burning away the vegetation hiding [[spider hole]]s and usually killing their occupants.\n\nThe time from liftoff to the target area for the Corsairs based on Peleliu Airfield was very short, sometimes only 10 to 15 seconds. Consequently, there was almost no time for pilots to raise their aircraft undercarriage; most pilots did not bother and left them down during the air strike. After the air strike was completed and the payload dropped, the Corsair simply turned back into the landing pattern again.\n\n===The Point===\n[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|Frontline warning sign on Peleliu, October 1944]]\n\nThe [[fortress]] at the end of the southern landing beaches (a.k.a. \u201cThe Point\u201d) continued to cause heavy Marine casualties due to enfilading fire from Japanese heavy machine guns and [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] artillery across the landing beaches. Puller ordered [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] George P. Hunt, commander of K Company, [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3rd Battalion, 1st Marines]], to capture the position. Hunt's company approached The Point short on supplies, having lost most of its machine guns while approaching the beaches. Hunt's second [[platoon]] was pinned down for nearly a day in an [[anti-tank trench]] between [[fortification]]s. The rest of his [[company (military unit)|company]] was endangered when the Japanese cut a hole in their line, surrounding his company and leaving his right flank cut off.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|49}}\n\nHowever, a [[rifle platoon]] began knocking out the Japanese gun positions one by one. Using [[smoke grenade]]s for cover, the platoon swept through each hole, destroying the positions with [[rifle grenade]]s and [[Close combat|close-quarters combat]]. After knocking out the six machine gun positions, the Marines faced the 47&nbsp;mm gun cave. A [[lieutenant]] blinded the 47&nbsp;mm gunner's visibility with a smoke grenade, allowing [[Corporal]] [[Henry W. Hahn]] to launch a grenade through the cave's aperture. The grenade detonated the 47&nbsp;mm's shells, forcing the cave's occupants out with their bodies lit aflame as well as their ammunition belts exploding around their waists. A Marine fire team was positioned on the flank of the cave where the former occupants were shot down.\n\nK Company had captured The Point, but Nakagawa [[counterattack]]ed. The next 30 hours saw four major counterattacks against a sole company, critically low on [[materiel|supplies]], out of water, and surrounded. The [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] soon had to resort to [[hand-to-hand combat]] to fend off the Japanese attackers. By the time [[reinforcement]]s arrived, the company had successfully repulsed all of the Japanese attacks, but had been reduced to 18 men, suffering 157 casualties during the battle for The Point.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|50\u201351}} Hunt and Hahn were both awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for their actions.\n\n===Ngesebus Island===\n[[File:Digging-peleliu-l.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marine in combat at Peleliu Island, September 1944]]\n\nThe 5th Marines\u2014after having secured the airfield\u2014were sent to capture Ngesebus Island, just north of Peleliu. Ngesebus was occupied by many Japanese artillery positions, and was the site of an airfield still under construction. The tiny island was connected to Peleliu by a small causeway, but 5th Marines commander Harris opted instead to make a shore-to-shore amphibious landing, predicting the causeway to be an obvious target for the island's defenders.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|77}}\n\nHarris coordinated a pre-landing bombardment of the island on September 28, carried out by Army {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns, naval guns, howitzers from the [[11th Marine Regiment|11th Marines]], strafing runs from VMF-114's Corsairs, and {{convert|75|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} fire from the approaching LVTs.<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|77}} Unlike the Navy's bombardment of Peleliu, Harris' assault on Ngesebus successfully killed most of the Japanese defenders. The Marines still faced opposition in the ridges and caves, but the island fell quickly, with relatively light casualties for the 5th Marines. They had suffered 15 killed and 33 wounded, and inflicted 470 casualties on the Japanese.\n\n===Bloody Nose Ridge===\n[[File:Marines wait in their foxholes - Peleliu.jpg|left|thumb|Marines waiting in their [[Defensive fighting position|fighting holes]]]]\n\nAfter capturing The Point, the 1st Marines moved north into the Umurbrogol pocket,<ref name=Moran/>{{rp|81}} named \"Bloody Nose Ridge\" by the Marines. Puller led his men in numerous assaults, but every one brought on severe casualties by the Japanese. The 1st Marines were trapped within the narrow paths between the ridges, with each ridge fortification supporting the other with deadly crossfire.\n\n[[File:Corsair attacks jap bunker on Peleliu.jpg|thumb|A Corsair drops napalm on Japanese positions atop Umurbrogol.]]\nThe Marines took increasingly high casualties as they slowly advanced through the ridges. The Japanese again showed unusual fire discipline, striking only when they could inflict maximum casualties. As casualties mounted, Japanese [[sniper]]s began to take aim at [[stretcher]] bearers, knowing that if two stretcher bearers were injured or killed, more would have to return to replace them, and the snipers could steadily pick off more and more Marines. The Japanese infiltrated the American lines at night to attack the Marines in their fighting holes. The Marines built two-man fighting holes, so one Marine could sleep while the other kept watch for infiltrators.\n\nOne particularly bloody battle on Bloody Nose came when the [[1st Battalion 1st Marines|1st Battalion, 1st Marines]]\u2014under the command of [[Major]] [[Ray Davis (U.S. Marine)|Raymond Davis]]\u2014attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. [[Everett P. Pope|Captain Everett Pope]] and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize what he thought was Hill 100. It took a day's fighting to reach what he thought was the crest of the hill, which was in fact another ridge occupied by more Japanese defenders.\n\n[[File:Resting on Peleliu Island.jpg|thumb|Marine Pfc. Douglas Lightheart (right) cradles his .30 caliber (7.62\u00d763mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun]] in his lap, while he and Pfc. Gerald Thursby Sr. take a cigarette break, during mopping up operations on Peleliu on 15 September 1944.]]\nTrapped at the base of the ridge, Captain Pope set up a small defense perimeter, which was attacked relentlessly by the Japanese throughout the night. The Marines soon ran out of ammunition, and had to fight the attackers with knives and fists, even resorting to throwing coral rock and empty ammunition boxes at the Japanese. Pope and his men managed to hold out until dawn came, which brought on more deadly fire. When they evacuated the position, only nine men remained. Pope later received the [[Medal of Honor]] for the action.

In total, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties during their month on Peleliu, over {{frac|1|3}} of their entire division. The 81st Infantry Division also suffered heavy losses with 3,300 casualties during their tenure on the island.\n\nPostwar statisticians calculated that it took U.S. forces over 1500 rounds of ammunition to kill each Japanese defender, and that during the course of the battle, the Americans expended 13.32 million rounds of .30-calibre, 1.52 million rounds of .45-calibre, 693,657 rounds of .50-calibre bullets, 118,262 hand grenades, and approximately 150,000 mortar rounds.<ref name= Hastings/>\n\nThe battle was controversial in the United States due to the island's lack of strategic value and the high casualty rate. The defenders lacked the means to interfere with potential US operations in the Philippines,<ref name= Hastings/> and the airfield captured on Peleliu never played a key role in subsequent operations. The high casualty rate exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War.<ref name=\"militaryhistoryonline.com\"/>\n\nInstead, the [[Ulithi Atoll]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] was used as a staging base for the invasion of Okinawa. In addition, few news reports were published about the battle because Rupertus' prediction of a \"three days\" victory motivated only six reporters to report from shore. The battle was also overshadowed by MacArthur's [[Battle of Leyte|return to the Philippines]] and the Allies' push towards [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Angaur|battles for Angaur]] and Peleliu showed Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense which would be seen again at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and Okinawa.<ref>{{harvnb|Morison|1958|p=46}}</ref> Naval bombardment prior to amphibious assault at Iwo Jima was only slightly more effective than at Peleliu, but at Okinawa the preliminary shelling was much improved.<ref name=Alexander95>Alexander,''Storm Landings'', p. 95.</ref> [[Frogmen]] performing [[underwater demolition]] at Iwo Jima confused the enemy by sweeping both coasts, but later alerted Japanese defenders to the exact assault beaches at Okinawa.<ref name=Alexander95/> American ground forces at Peleliu gained experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Okinawa.<ref>{{harvnb|Morison|1958|p=47}}</ref>\n\nOn the recommendation of Admiral [[William F.

The attack was supported by intensive ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus|Operation ''Uranus'']], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food.

There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped.

The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union.

Army Group South had overrun the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1941.

Army Group South (A), under the command of [[Wilhelm List]], was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s 6th Army and [[Hermann Hoth]]'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers were only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle. The Germans began using the armies of their [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian and [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romanian]] allies to guard their left (northern) flank.

Beginning in late August, continuing in September and into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans' northern flank. The actions resulted in more than 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault.\n\nOn 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd]] and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city.

The Soviet [[13th Guards Rifle Division]], assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1 suffered particularly heavy losses. Over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours, and just 320 out of the original 10,000 survived the entire battle. Both objectives were retaken, but only temporarily. The railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours. By the following evening, the 13th Guards Rifle Division had ceased to exist.\n\nCombat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city. About fifty Red Army defenders, cut off from resupply, held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water. Only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance. The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food.

Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank.

Toward the end of the battle, the gigantic [[railroad gun]] [[Dora (artillery)|nicknamed ''Dora'']] was brought into the area. The Soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the Volga. This artillery was able to bombard the German positions or at least provide counter-battery fire.\n\nSnipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties.

The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] noted the \"sinister\" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: \"The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower\" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed [[SMERSH]]).<ref name=\"Beevor2004\">{{harvnb|Beevor|2004|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|154\u201368|date=June 2011}} On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|154\u201368|date=June 2011}} [[Richard Overy]] addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is \"easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,\" to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to \"distort our view of the Soviet war effort.\"<ref>Overy, Richard.

These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942\u20131943 (19 November 1942 \u2013 3 March 1943), which involved some 15 Armies operating on several fronts. According to Zhukov, \"German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=1974 |isbn=9781781592915 |pages=110\u201311}}</ref>\n\n===Weakness on the German flanks===\nDuring the siege, the German and allied [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's north and south [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] had pressed their [[headquarters]] for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single [[platoon]]. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons. Zhukov states, \"Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|95\u201396, 119, 122, 124}}\n\nBecause of the total focus on the city, the [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army.

Paulus had requested permission to \"withdraw the 6th Army behind the Don,\" but was rejected.

The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defense, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\nDuring the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named \"Uranus\" and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]]. The plan was similar to the one Zhukov had used to achieve victory at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] three years before, where he had sprung a [[pincer movement|double envelopment]] and destroyed the [[IJA 23d Division|23rd Division]] of the Japanese army.<ref>Maps of the conflict.

[[Nikolay Vatutin]] consisted of three complete armies, the [[Soviet First Guards Army|1st Guards Army]], [[5th Guards Tank Army|5th Tank Army]], and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry [[Division (military)|divisions]], eight tank [[brigade]]s, two [[Mechanized force|motorized]] brigades, six [[cavalry]] divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.\n\nBehind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.\n\nOn 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]]. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, were overrun by large numbers of tanks. The Soviet forces raced west and met on 23 November at the town of [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]], sealing the ring around Stalingrad.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} The link-up of the Soviet forces, not filmed at the time, was later re-enacted for a [[propaganda]] film which was shown worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.\n\n==Sixth Army surrounded==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-S\u00fcd, rum\u00e4nische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Romanian soldiers near Stalingrad]]\n[[File:German pows stalingrad 1943.jpg|thumb|German soldiers as prisoners of war.

In addition, Beevor states that one quarter of the Sixth Army's frontline strength (i.e. more than 65,000 personnel) were ''[[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hilfswillige]]'' (''Hiwi''), or \"volunteer auxiliaries\",<ref>Beevor, Antony (1999). Stalingrad. London: Penguin. p. 184. {{ISBN|0-14-024985-0}}. Beevor states that one quarter of the Sixth Army's frontline strength were ''Hiwi''. Note: this reference still does not directly support the claim that there were 40,000 ''Hiwi''.</ref> a term used for personnel recruited amongst Soviet POWs and civilians from areas under occupation. ''Hiwi'' often proved to be reliable Axis personnel, because the Soviet penalty for collaboration was [[summary execution]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Other sources suggest that only 40,000 ''Hiwi'' and similar auxiliaries were surrounded,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} or about 15% of the total. German personnel in the pocket numbered about 210,000, according to strength breakdowns of the 20 field divisions (average size 9,000) and 100 battalion sized units of the Sixth Army on 19 November 1942. Inside the [[Pocket (military)|pocket]] ({{lang-de|[[Pocket (military)#Kessel|Kessel]]}}, literally \"cauldron\"), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Not all of the 6th Army was trapped: 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other 2 divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.\n\nEven with the desperate situation of the Sixth Army, Army Group A continued their invasion of the Caucasus further south from 19 November until 19 December. By 19 December the German army was in full retreat out of the Caucasus, while using the Sixth Army to tie down the Soviet forces. Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.\n\n[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein. Under his command were the 20 German and 2 Romanian divisions encircled at Stalingrad, Adam's battle groups formed along the [[Chir River]] and on the Don bridgehead, plus the remains of the Romanian 3rd Army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|107, 113}}\n\nThe Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a [[circumvallation]] facing inward and a [[contravallation]] facing outward.

When asked by Hitler, G\u00f6ring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],<ref name=hayward98/>{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the [[Luftwaffe]] could supply the 6th Army with an \"[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].\" This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|132}}\n\n[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]\n\nThe director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, [[Wolfram von Richthofen]], tried to get this decision overturned.

The maximum {{convert|107|t|ST|abbr=on}} they could deliver a day \u2013 based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at \u2013 was far less than the minimum {{convert|750|t|ST|abbr=on}} needed.<ref name=hayward98/><ref group=\"Note\">Shirer p. 926 says that \"Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,\" while Craig pp. 206\u201307 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: \"Are you aware&nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&nbsp;... Seven hundred tons!

General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.<ref>Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311\u201312, 575.</ref> He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.\n\nSupplying the 270,000 men trapped in the \"cauldron\" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, \"On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of {{convert|85|t|ST|abbr=on}} of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of {{convert|106|t|ST|abbr=on}} per day.

The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft \u2013 tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions. These factors, taken together, prevented the Luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces, ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th Army.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Aaron|date=April 2016|title=For Want of the Means: A Logistical Appraisal of the Stalingrad Airlift|url=|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=298\u2013318|via=|doi=10.1080/13518046.2016.1168137}}</ref>\n\nIn the early parts of the operation, fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city.<ref name=walsh2000/>{{Rp|153|date=June 2009}} Transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave.

Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 [[Junkers Ju 86|Ju 86s]] took off for [[Novocherkassk]] \u2013 leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground.

By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on [[Rostov-on-Don]], \"an early abandonment\" of Stalingrad \"would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,\" and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.

Sensing that this was the last chance for a break out, Mainstein pleaded with Hitler on Dec 18th, but Hitler refused.  Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout.  The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''[[Hiwi (volunteer)|HiWis]]'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody [[urban warfare]] began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0316-0204-005, Russland, Paulus in Kriegsgefangenschaft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Friedrich Paulus]] (left), with his chief of staff, ''Generalleutnant'' [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]] (centre) and his aide, [[Wilhelm Adam (politician)|Wilhelm Adam]] (right), after their surrender]]\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast \"to the last soldier and the last bullet.\" Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a \"heroic drama of German history.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=549}}</ref> On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported \"18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|193}}\n\nOn 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.<ref name=Bartov>Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pp.&nbsp;166\u201367</ref> Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to \"sacrifice themselves for the F\u00fchrer\".<ref name=Bartov/>\n\nThe remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered.

In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] \u2013 fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure.

But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face \u2013 with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans\u2014dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up \u2013 men who had died in that basement\u2014about a dozen wax-like dummies.

Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:\n\n{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe.

Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. [[Joseph Goebbels]] read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H.

Before ''Operation Uranus'', the 1st Romanian Armored Division consisted of 121 [[Panzer 35(t)|R-2]] light tanks and 19 German-produced tanks ([[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV|IV]]). All of the 19 German tanks were lost, as well as 81 of the R-2 light tanks. Only 27 of the latter were lost in combat, however, the remaining 54 being abandoned after breaking down or running out of fuel. Ultimately, however, Romanian armored warfare proved to be a tactical success, as the Romanians destroyed 127 Soviet tanks for the cost of their 100 lost units. Romanian forces destroyed 62 Soviet tanks on 20 November for the cost of 25 tanks of their own, followed by 65 more Soviet tanks on 22 November, for the cost of 10 tanks of their own.<ref>Steven J.

This was accomplished by Romanian [[Vickers Model 1931|Vickers/Re\u0219i\u021ba]] 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, which proved effective against Soviet armor.

Daoxuan's account, however, implies \"a specific itinerary\":{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=56}} \"He first arrived at [[Nanyue|Nan-y\u00fceh]] during the [[Liu Song dynasty|Sung period]]. From there he turned north and came to the Kingdom of Wei\"{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=87}} This implies that Bodhidharma had travelled to China by sea and that he had crossed over the [[Yangtze]].\n\nThirdly, Daoxuan suggests a date for Bodhidharma's arrival in China. He writes that Bodhidharma makes landfall in the time of the Song, thus making his arrival no later than the time of the Song's fall to the [[Southern Qi]] in 479.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=56}}\n\nFinally, Daoxuan provides information concerning Bodhidharma's death. Bodhidharma, he writes, died at the banks of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]], where he was interred by his disciple Dazu Huike, possibly in a cave. According to Daoxuan's chronology, Bodhidharma's death must have occurred prior to 534, the date of the Northern Wei's fall, because Dazu Huike subsequently leaves Luoyang for [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]]. Furthermore, citing the shore of the Luo River as the place of death might possibly suggest that Bodhidharma died in [[Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei#The Heyin Massacre and aftermath|the mass executions at Heyin]] (\u6cb3\u9670) in 528. Supporting this possibility is a report in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] stating that a Buddhist monk was among the victims at H\u00e9y\u012bn.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=139}}\n\n=== Later accounts ===\n[[File:Bodhidharma Shaolinsi.JPG|thumb|200px|Bodhidharma, stone carving]]\n\n==== ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' ====\nIn the ''[[Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall]]'' (\u7956\u5802\u96c6 ''Z\u01d4t\u00e1ngj\u00ed'') of 952, the elements of the traditional Bodhidharma story are in place. Bodhidharma is said to have been a disciple of [[Prajnatara|Praj\u00f1\u0101t\u0101ra]],{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=2}} thus establishing the latter as the 27th patriarch in India. After a three-year journey, Bodhidharma reached China in 527,{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=2}} during the Liang (as opposed to the Song in Daoxuan's text). The ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' includes Bodhidharma's encounter with [[Emperor Wu of Liang]], which was first recorded around 758 in the appendix to a text by Shenhui (\u795e\u6703), a disciple of Huineng.{{sfn|McRae|2000}}\n\nFinally, as opposed to Daoxuan's figure of \"over 180 years,\"{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=88}} the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' states that Bodhidharma died at the age of 150. He was then buried on Mount Xiong'er (\u718a\u8033\u5c71 ''Xi\u00f3ng'\u0115r Sh\u0101n'') to the west of Luoyang. However, three years after the burial, in the [[Pamir Mountains]], S\u00f2ngy\u00fan (\u5b8b\u96f2)\u2014an official of one of the later Wei kingdoms\u2014encountered Bodhidharma, who claimed to be returning to India and was carrying a single sandal. Bodhidharma predicted the death of Songyun's ruler, a prediction which was borne out upon the latter's return. Bodhidharma's tomb was then opened, and only a single sandal was found inside.\n\nAccording to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', Bodhidharma left the Liang court in 527 and relocated to [[Mount Song]] near Luoyang and the Shaolin Monastery, where he \"faced a wall for nine years, not speaking for the entire time\",{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=182}} his date of death can have been no earlier than 536. Moreover, his encounter with the Wei official indicates a date of death no later than 554, three years before the fall of the [[Western Wei]].\n\n==== D\u00e0oyu\u00e1n \u2013 Transmission of the Lamp ====\nSubsequent to the ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'', the only dated addition to the biography of Bodhidharma is in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (\u666f\u5fb7\u50b3\u71c8\u9304 ''J\u012dngd\u00e9 chu\u00e1nd\u0113ng l\u00f9'', published 1004 [[Common Era|CE]]), by D\u00e0oyu\u00e1n (\u9053\u539f), in which it is stated that Bodhidharma's original name had been Bodhit\u0101ra but was changed by his master Praj\u00f1\u0101t\u0101ra.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=119}} The same account is given by the Japanese master Keizan's 13th-century work of the same title.{{sfn|Cook|2003}}\n\n=== Popular traditions ===\nSeveral contemporary popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins.

When asked why he was holding his shoe, Bodhidharma answered \"You will know when you reach Shaolin monastery. Don't mention that you saw me or you will meet with disaster\". After arriving at the palace, S\u00f2ngy\u00fan told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had S\u00f2ngy\u00fan arrested for lying. At Shaolin Monastery, the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe.

In the ''Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices'' and the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'', Daoyu and Dazu Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.{{sfn|Dumoulin|1993|p=37}}{{sfn|Cole|2009|p=73\u2013114}}\n\nIn the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan lineage was developed:\n{{quote|These famous biographies were non-sectarian. The Ch'an biographical works, however, aimed to establish Ch'an as a legitimate school of Buddhism traceable to its Indian origins, and at the same time championed a particular form of Ch'an. Historical accuracy was of little concern to the compilers; old legends were repeated, new stories were invented and reiterated until they too became legends.{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=5-6}}}}\n\n[[D. T. Suzuki]] contends that Chan's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had \"no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism\" and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.{{sfn|Suzuki|1949|p=168}}\n\n=== Six patriarchs ===\nThe earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma into the 5th to 7th generation of patriarchs.

The idea of a line of descent from \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (\u8b49\u9053\u6b4c ''Zh\u00e8ngd\u00e0o g\u0113'') by Y\u01d2ngji\u0101 Xu\u00e1nju\u00e9 (665-713),{{sfn|Chang|1967}} one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Hu\u00ecn\u00e9ng]], was Bodhidharma, the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha via his disciple [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa]]:\n<poem>Mahakashyapa was the first, leading the line of transmission;\nTwenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;\nThe Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;\nAnd Bodhidharma became the First Father here\nHis mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,\nAnd by them many minds came to see the Light.{{sfn|Suzuki|1948|p=50}}</poem>\nThe ''Transmission of the Light'' gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:{{sfn|Cook|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}}\n\n{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}\n\n== Modern scholarship ==\nBodhidharma has been the subject of critical scientific research, which has shed new light on the traditional stories about Bodhidharma.\n\n=== Biography as a hagiographic process ===\nAccording to John McRae, Bodhidharma has been the subject of a [[Hagiography|hagiographic process]] which served the needs of Chan Buddhism. According to him it is not possible to write an accurate biography of Bodhidharma:\n{{quote|It is ultimately impossible to reconstruct any original or accurate biography of the man whose life serves as the original trace of his hagiography \u2013 where \"trace\" is a term from Jacques Derrida meaning the beginningless beginning of a phenomenon, the imagined but always intellectually unattainable origin. Hence any such attempt by modern biographers to reconstruct a definitive account of Bodhidharma's life is both doomed to failure and potentially no different in intent from the hagiographical efforts of premodern writers.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=24}}}}\n\nMcRae's standpoint accords with Yanagida's standpoint: \"Yanagida ascribes great historical value to the witness of the disciple T'an-lin, but at the same time acknowledges the presence of \"many puzzles in the biography of Bodhidharma\". Given the present state of the sources, he considers it impossible to compile a reliable account of Bodhidharma's life.{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=89}}\n\nSeveral scholars have suggested that the composed image of Bodhidharma depended on the combination of supposed historical information on various historical figures over several centuries.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=25}} Bodhidharma as a historical person may even never have actually existed.{{sfn|Chaline|2003|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n=== Origins and place of birth ===\nDumoulin comments on the three principal sources. The Persian heritage is doubtful, according to Dumoulin: \"In the description of the Lo-yang temple, bodhidharma is called a Persian. Given the ambiguity of geographical references in writings of this period, such a statement should not be taken too seriously.\"{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=89-90}} Dumoulin considers Tan-lin's account of Bodhidharma being \"the third son of a great Brahman king\" to be a later addition, and finds the exact meaning of \"South Indian Brahman stock\" unclear: \"And when Tao-hsuan speaks of origins from South Indian Brahman stock, it is not clear whether he is referring to roots in nobility or to India in general as the land of the Brahmans.\"{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=90}}\n\nThese Chinese sources lend themselves to make inferences about Bodhidharma's origins. \"The third son of a Brahman king\" has been speculated to mean \"the third son of a Pallavine king\".{{sfn|Kambe|(year unknown)}} Based on a specific pronunciation of the Chinese characters \u9999\u81f3 as Kang-zhi, \"meaning fragrance extreme\",{{sfn|Kambe|(year unknown)}} Tsutomu Kambe identifies \u9999\u81f3 to be [[Kanchipuram]], an old capital town in the state [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. According to Tsutomu Kambe, \"Kanchi means 'a radiant jewel' or 'a luxury belt with jewels', and puram means a town or a state in the sense of earlier times. Thus, it is understood that the '\u9999\u81f3-Kingdom' corresponds to the old capital 'Kanchipuram'.\"{{sfn|Kambe|(year unknown)}}\n\nAcharya Raghu, in his work 'Bodhidharma Retold', used a combination of multiple factors to identify Bodhidharma from the state of Andhra Pradesh in South India, specifically to the geography around Mt. Sailum or modern day Srisailam. {{sfn|Acharya Raghu|2017}}\n\nThe [[Pakistan]]i scholar [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]] speculated that according to popular accounts in Pakistan's northwest, Bodhidharma may be from the region around the [[Peshawar]] valley, or possibly around modern Afghanistan's eastern border with Pakistan.<ref>See Dani, AH, 'Some Early Buddhist Texts from Taxila and Peshawar Valley', Paper, Lahore SAS, 1983; and 'Short History of Pakistan' Vol 1, original 1967, rev ed 1992, and 'History of the Northern Areas of Pakistan' ed Lahore: Sang e Meel, 2001</ref>\n\n=== Caste ===\nIn the context of the [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] the mention of \"Brahman king\"{{sfn|Dumoulin|Heisig|Knitter|2005|p=89}} acquires a nuance. Broughton notes that \"king\" implies that Bodhidharma was of a member of the  [[khyastha|royal caste, an khyastha]] caste of warriors and rulers.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=2}} Brahman is, in western contexts, easily understood as Brahmana or [[Brahmin]], which means ''priest''.\n\n=== Name ===\nAccording to tradition Bodhidharma was given this name by his teacher known variously as Panyatara, [[Prajnatara]], or Praj\u00f1\u0101dhara.{{sfn|Eitel|1904}} His name prior to monkhood is said to be Jayavarman.<ref name=Krishna>{{cite book| title=Bodhidharma: Kata Awal adalah Kata Akhir |author=Anand Krishna |year=2005 |publisher=Gramedia Pustaka Utama |language=Indonesian |isbn=9792217711}}</ref>\n\nBodhidharma is associated with several other names, and is also known by the name Bodhitara. Faure notes that:\n{{quote|Bodhidharma\u2019s name appears sometimes truncated as Bodhi, or more often as Dharma (Ta-mo). In the first case, it may be confused with another of his rivals, [[Bodhiruci]].{{sfn|Faure|1986}}}}\n\nTibetan sources give his name as \"Bodhidharmott\u0101ra\" or \"Dharmottara\", that is, \"Highest teaching (dharma) of enlightenment\".{{sfn|Goodman|1992|p=65}}\n\n=== Abode in China ===\nBuswell dates Bodhidharma abode in China approximately at the early 5th century.{{sfn|Buswell|unknown|pp=57, 130}} Broughton dates Bodhidharma's presence in Luoyang to between 516 and 526, when the temple referred to\u2014Y\u01d2ngn\u00edngs\u00ec (\u6c38\u5be7\u5bfa), was at the height of its glory.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=55}} Starting in 526, Y\u01d2ngn\u00edngs\u00ec suffered damage from a series of events, ultimately leading to its destruction in 534.{{sfn|Broughton|1999|p=138}}\n\n=== Shaolin boxing ===\nTraditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century [[qigong]] manual known as the ''[[Yijin Jing]]''.{{sfn|Shahar |2008|pp=165\u2013173}} The preface of this work says that Bodhidharma left behind the ''Yi Jin Jing'', from which the monks obtained the fighting skills which made them gain some fame.{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=183}} \n\nThe authenticity of the ''Yi Jin Jing'' has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda Ryuchi. According to Lin Boyuan, \"This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.\"{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his ''Zhongguo wushu shi'': \"As for the \"Yi Jin Jing\" (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books \"Xi Sui Jing\" (Marrow Washing Classic) and \"Yi Jin Jing\" within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, \"the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript.\" Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts.

This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most \"sacred\" of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts.

They form the building blocks of the [[DNA]] double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and [[RNA]]. Dictated by specific [[hydrogen bond]]ing patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs ([[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its [[nucleotide sequence]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sequence-Dependent Variability of B-DNA | doi=10.1007/0-387-29148-2_2 | journal=DNA Conformation and Transcription |pages=18\u201334|year=2005 |last1=Zhurkin |first1=Victor B | last2=Tolstorukov | first2=Michael Y | last3=Xu | first3=Fei | last4=Colasanti | first4=Andrew V | last5=Olson | first5=Wilma K | isbn=978-0-387-25579-8 }}</ref> The [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of this based-paired structure provides a redundant copy of the [[genetic information]] encoded within each strand of DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which [[DNA polymerase]] replicates DNA and [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.\n\nIntramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., [[transfer RNA]]), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-[[uracil]]) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional [[RNA structure|structures]]. In addition, base-pairing between [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) forms the basis for the [[molecular recognition]] events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming [[Genetic code|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of [[protein]]s via the [[genetic code]].\n\nThe size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism's entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s).

Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the \"right\" pairs to form stably. DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. But, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly; stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.<ref name=\"Yakovchuk2006\">Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D.

Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564\u2013574.</ref>\n\nThe larger [[nucleobase]]s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called [[purine]]s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called [[pyrimidine]]s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine-pyrimidine base pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine-pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in [[RNA]] (see [[wobble base pair]]).\n\nPaired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature, but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a [[Dna melting|melting point]] that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of [[extremophile]] organisms such as ''[[Thermus thermophilus]]'' are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently \u2014 for example, the promoter regions for often-[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] genes \u2014 are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see [[TATA box]]). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing  [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]] reactions.\n\n===Examples===\nThe following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the [[5' end]] to the [[3' end]]; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.\n\n:A base-paired DNA sequence:\n::{{code|ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG}}\n::{{code|TAGCTAACTCGAGATCGC}}\n\n:The corresponding RNA sequence, in which [[uracil]] is substituted for thymine where uracil takes its place in the RNA strand:\n::{{code|AUCGAUUGAGCUCUAGCG}}\n::{{code|UAGCUAACUCGAGAUCGC}}\n\n==Base analogs and intercalators==\n\n{{Main|Nucleic acid analogues}}\nChemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly [[point mutation]]s) in [[DNA replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]]. This is due to their [[isosteric]] chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is [[5-bromouracil]], which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its [[enol]] form.\n\nOther chemicals, known as [[DNA intercalation|DNA intercalators]], fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce [[frameshift mutation]]s by \"masquerading\" as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large [[polyaromatic]] compounds and are known or suspected [[carcinogen]]s. Examples include [[ethidium bromide]] and [[acridine]].\n\n==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==\n{{See also|Artificial gene synthesis|Expanded genetic code|Nucleic acid analogue|Synthetic genomics}}\nAn unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature.  DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T ([[adenine]] \u2013 [[thymine]]) and G-C ([[guanine]] \u2013 [[cytosine]]).

Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] during the 1970s and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] during the early 1990s. [[Ozzie Newsome]], the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager.\n\nThe home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], home field of the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] and [[Baltimore Stallions]] years before. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium next to [[Camden Yards]] in 1998. Raven Stadium would subsequently wear the names [[PSINet|PSI Net]] Stadium and then [[M&T Bank Stadium]].\n\n===The early years and Ted Marchibroda era (1996\u20131998)===\n\n====1996====\n{{main article|1996 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nIn the [[1996 NFL Draft]], the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle [[Jonathan Ogden]] at No. 4 overall and linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] at No. 26 overall. Both Ogden and Lewis went on to play for the Ravens for their entire professional careers and were both inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n[[File:Jonathan Ogden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jonathan Ogden]] at the [[2006 Pro Bowl]]. Ogden played offensive tackle for the Ravens from 1996 through 2007 and was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013.]]\nThe 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the [[Oakland Raiders]], but finished the season 4\u201312 despite receiver [[Michael Jackson (wide receiver)|Michael Jackson]] leading the league with 14 touchdown catches.\n\n====1997====\n{{main article|1997 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nThe 1997 Ravens started 3\u20131. [[Peter Boulware]], a rookie defender from [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6\u20139\u20131. On October 26, the team made its first trip to [[Landover, Maryland]] to play their new [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|regional rivals]], the [[Washington Redskins]], for the first time in the regular season, at the new [[Jack Kent Cooke Stadium]] (replacing the still-standing [[RFK Stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]). The Ravens won the game 20\u201317.\n\n====1998====\n{{main article|1998 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nQuarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] left for the [[New York Jets]] before the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]], and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt [[Jim Harbaugh]], and later [[Eric Zeier]]. Cornerback [[Rod Woodson]] joined the team after a successful stint with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Priest Holmes]] started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards.\n\nThe Ravens finished 1998 with a 6\u201310 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens, with Jim Harbaugh at quarterback, won 38\u201331.\n\n===Brian Billick era and first Super Bowl victory (1999\u20132007)===\n\n====1999====\n{{main article|1999 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Baltimore Ravens B.png|right|thumb|Baltimore's text logo]]\n\nThree consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. [[Brian Billick]] took over as head coach in [[1999 NFL season|1999]]. Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting [[Minnesota Vikings]] the season before. Quarterback [[Tony Banks (quarterback)|Tony Banks]] came to Baltimore from the [[St. Louis Rams]] and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver [[Qadry Ismail]], who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4\u20137 but managed to finish with an 8\u20138 record.\n\nDue to continual financial hardships for the organization, the NFL took an unusual move and directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to [[Steve Bisciotti]]. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.\n\n====2000: Super Bowl XXXV champions====\n{{main|2000 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nBanks shared playing time in the 2000 regular season with [[Trent Dilfer]]. Both players put up decent numbers (and a 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie [[Jamal Lewis]] helped too) but the defense became the team's hallmark and bailed a struggling offense out in many instances through the season. [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] was named Defensive Player of the Year. Two of his defensive teammates, [[Sam Adams (football player)|Sam Adams]] and [[Rod Woodson]], made the [[Pro Bowl]]. Baltimore's season started strong with a 5\u20131 record. But the team struggled through mid-season, at one point going five games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12\u20134 and making the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time.\n\nDuring the 2000 season, the Ravens defense broke two notable NFL records. They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] mark of 198 points for a 16-game season as well as surpassing the [[1986 Chicago Bears season|1986 Chicago Bears]] mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record.\n\nSince the divisional rival [[2000 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] had a record of 13\u20133, the Ravens had to play in the [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild card]] round. They dominated the [[2000 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 21\u20133 in their first game. In the divisional playoff, they went on the road to Tennessee. With the score tied 10\u201310 in the fourth quarter, an [[Al Del Greco]] [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Anthony Mitchell, and a [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24\u201310 win put the Ravens in the [[AFC Championship]] against the [[2000 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. The game was rarely in doubt. [[Shannon Sharpe]]'s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback [[Rich Gannon]] were crucial as the Ravens won easily, 16\u20133.\n[[File:Geoge W.

The game was also dominated by the Ravens. They recorded four sacks and forced five turnovers, one of which was a [[Kerry Collins]] interception returned for a touchdown by [[Duane Starks]]. The Giants' only score was a [[Ron Dixon (American football)|Ron Dixon]] kickoff return for another touchdown; however, the Ravens immediately countered with a return by [[Jermaine Lewis (American football, born 1974)|Jermaine Lewis]]. The Ravens became champions with a 34\u20137 win, becoming only the third [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild card]] team to win a Super Bowl championship.\n\n====2001====\n{{main article|2001 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nIn [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the Ravens attempted to defend their title with [[Elvis Grbac]] as their new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to [[Jamal Lewis]] on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3\u20133 start, the Ravens defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10\u20136. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20\u20133 win over the [[Miami Dolphins]], in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27\u201310.\n\n====2002====\n{{main article|2002 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nBaltimore ran into [[salary cap]] problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected [[Ed Reed]] with the 24th overall pick. Reed would go on to become one of the best safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013. Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a post-season berth. Their final record that year was 7\u20139.\n\n====2003====\n{{main|2003 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Brian Billick & Coach Zauner.jpg|thumb|240px|Coach [[Gary Zauner]] (front) and [[Brian Billick]] with the Baltimore Ravens in 2003.]]\nIn [[2003 NFL season|2003]], the Ravens drafted their new quarterback, [[Kyle Boller]], but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by [[Anthony Wright (quarterback)|Anthony Wright]]. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including a record 295 yards in one game against the [[2003 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] on September 14). With a 10&ndash;6 record, Baltimore won their first [[AFC North]] division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the [[2003 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]], went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20\u201317 on a late field goal, and Baltimore's season ended early.\n\nRay Lewis was also named Defensive Player of the year for the second time in his career.\n\nIn April 2003, [[Art Modell]] sold 49% of the team to [[Steve Bisciotti]], a local businessman who had made his fortune in the temporary staffing field. After the season, Art Modell sold his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner.\n\n====2004====\n{{main article|2004 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nThe Ravens did not make the playoffs in [[2004 NFL season|2004]] and finished the season with a record of 9\u20137 with [[Kyle Boller]] spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner [[Deion Sanders]] and third year safety [[Ed Reed]], who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15\u20131 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the regular season.\n\n====2005====\n{{main article|2005 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nIn the 2005 offseason the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing [[Derrick Mason]] from the Titans and drafting star Oklahoma wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. However, the Ravens ended their season 6\u201310, but defeated the [[Green Bay Packers]] 48\u20133 on [[Monday Night Football]] and the Super Bowl champion Steelers.\n\n====2006====\n{{main article|2006 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:DerrickMason.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Derrick Mason]] played mainly as the Ravens No. 1 receiver from 2005 through 2010.]]\nThe 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6\u201310 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4\u20130, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback [[Steve McNair]].\n\nThe Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator [[Jim Fassel]] in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in week 13.\n\nStill ranked second overall to first-place [[San Diego Chargers]], the Ravens continued on. They defeated the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and held the defending Super Bowl champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to only one touchdown at [[Heinz Field]], allowing the Ravens to clinch the [[AFC North]].\n\nThe Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13\u20133 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of \"Judgment Day\" with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15\u20136, ending Baltimore's season.\n\n====2007====\n{{main article|2007 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Willis McGahee at Andrews AFB 070821-F-0000J-001 crop.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Willis McGahee]] played four seasons as a running back for the Ravens.]]\nAfter a stellar 2006 season, the Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13\u20133 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]] in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. A humiliating 22\u201316 overtime loss to the previously winless [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal on New Year's Eve, one day after the end of the regular season. He was replaced by John Harbaugh, the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).\n\n===John Harbaugh/Joe Flacco era; second Super Bowl (2008\u2013present)===\n\n====2008: Arrival of John Harbaugh, Flacco, and Ray Rice====\n{{main article|2008 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:7 Boller 5 Flacco.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Joe Flacco]] (right) and [[Kyle Boller]] during 2008 Training Camp.]]\nWith rookies at head coach ([[John Harbaugh]]) and quarterback ([[Joe Flacco]]), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with lots of uncertainty. Baltimore smartly recovered in 2008, winning eleven games and achieving a wild card spot in the postseason. On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an [[Ed Reed]] touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27\u20139 at [[Dolphin Stadium]] on January 4, 2009 in a wild-card game.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290104015&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines \"Pennington throws four interceptions in loss,\" ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 4, 2009.]</ref> Six days later, they advanced to the [[AFC Championship Game]] by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13\u201310 at [[LP Field]] on a [[Matt Stover]] field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290110010&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines] \"Stover's FG with 53 seconds left boots Ravens into AFC Championship Game\".</ref> The Ravens fell one victory short of [[Super Bowl XLIII]] by losing to the Steelers 23\u201314 at [[Heinz Field]] on January 18, 2009.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290118023 \"Polamalu's INT return secures Steelers' Super Bowl berth,\" ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 18, 2009.]</ref>\n\n====2009====\n{{main|2009 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Ray-Lewis-2008-Steelers-regseason-game.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ray Lewis]] during a 2008 regular season game.]]\nIn [[2009 NFL season|2009]], the Ravens won their first three matches, then lost the next three, including a close match in [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]]. The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. That game was notable for the huge number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] and [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the [[2009 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] and [[2009 Chicago Bears season|Bears]], giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the [[2009 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to end the season. With a record of 9\u20137, the team finished second in the division and gained another wild card. Moving into the playoffs, they overwhelmed the [[2009 New England Patriots season|Patriots]]; nevertheless they did not reach the AFC Championship because they were routed 20\u20133 by the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] in the divisional round a week later.\n\n====2010====\n{{main|2010 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nBaltimore managed to beat the Jets 10\u20139 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly-played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24\u201317 in Week 3 and then Pittsburgh 17\u201314 in Week 4. The Ravens scored a fine win (31\u201317) at home against Denver in Week 5. After an overtime loss to New England, they narrowly avoided losing at home to the winless Bills. Next, the Ravens hosted Miami and won 26\u201310, breaking that team's 4\u20130 road streak. On Thursday Night, the team headed to Atlanta and lost 26\u201321 in a game that had some criticizing the officiating. The Ravens finished the season 12\u20134, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and crushed the unprepared Chiefs 30\u20137, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought battle.\n\n====2011====\n{{main|2011 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Terrell Suggs 2011 stadium practice.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Terrell Suggs]] during practice in 2011.]]\nThe Ravens hosted their arch-enemy in Week 1 of the 2011 season. On a hot, humid day in M&T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with three touchdowns 35\u20137. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series.\n\nBut in Week 2, the Ravens collapsed in Tennessee and lost 26\u201313. They rebounded by routing the Rams in Week 3 and then overpowering the Jets 34\u201317 in Week 4.\nWeek 5, the Ravens had a bye week, following a game against the Texans. But in Week 7, Baltimore had a stunning MNF upset loss in Jacksonville as they were held to one touchdown in a 12\u20137 loss. Their final scoring drive failed as Joe Flacco threw an interception in the closing seconds of the game.\n\n[[File:Jarret Johnson.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Jarret Johnson]] spent nine seasons with the Ravens from 2003-2011.]]\nAfter beating the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 of the regular season, the Ravens advanced to the playoffs as the Number 2 seed in the AFC with a record of 12-4.  They gained the distinction of AFC North Champions over Pittsburgh (12-4) due to a tie breaker.\n\nRavens' Lee Evans was stripped of a 14-yard touchdown pass by the Patriots Sterling Moore with 22 seconds left and Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff pushed a 32-yard field goal attempt wide left on fourth down as the Patriots held on to beat the Ravens 23-20 during the AFC championship game and advance to Super Bowl XLVI.\n\n====2012: Ray Lewis' final season and 2nd Super Bowl====\n{{main|2012 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n[[File:Jacoby Jones Touchdown Super Bowl XLVII.jpg|thumb|Jacoby Jones dives for the end zone during the second quarter of Super Bowl XLVII.]]\n[[File:Lombardi Trophy following Super Bowl XLVII.jpg|thumb|Lombardi trophy presentation following Super Bowl XLVII.]]\nThe Ravens' attempt to convert Joe Flacco into a pocket passer remained a work in progress as the 2012 season began. Terrell Suggs suffered a tendon injury during an off-season basketball game and was unable to play for at least several weeks. In the opener on September 10, Baltimore routed Cincinnati 44-13. After this easy win, the team headed to Philadelphia. The Eagles had struggled during their Week 1 match in Cleveland and were not expected to win, but a bizarre game ensued thanks to the NFL facing another lockout mess, this one involving the league's referees, who were replaced by ex-college officials. The replacement officials were widely criticized throughout the league.  This game featured multiple questionable calls that went against the Ravens, perhaps costing them the game 24-23.\n\nReturning home for a primetime rematch of the AFC Championship, another bizarre game ensued. New England picked apart the Baltimore defense (which was considerably weakened without Terrell Suggs and some other players lost over the off-season) for the first half. Trouble began early in the game when a streaker ran out onto the field and had to be tackled by security, and accelerated when, at 2:18 in the 4th quarter, the referees made a holding call on RG [[Marshal Yanda]]. Enraged fans repeatedly chanted an obscenity at this penalty. The Ravens finally drove downfield and on the last play of the game, [[Justin Tucker]] kicked a 27-yard field goal to win the game 31-30, capping off a second intense and controversially-officiated game in a row for the Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens would win the AFC North with a 10-6 record, but finished 4th in the AFC playoff seeding, and thus had to play a wild-card game. After defeating the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 24-9 at home (the final home game of Ray Lewis), the Ravens traveled to Denver to play against the top seeded Broncos. In a very back-and-forth contest, the Ravens pulled out a 38-35 victory in double overtime. They then won their 2nd AFC championship by coming back from a 13-7 halftime deficit to defeat the New England Patriots once again, 28-13.\n\nThe Ravens played the [[Super Bowl XLVII]] on February 3, 2013, against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Baltimore built a 28\u20136 lead early in the third quarter before a partial [[power outage]] in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/ravens-beat-49ers-in-super-bowl-after-lights-go-out.html?_r=0|title= Power Fails and 49ers Surge, but Ravens Win|date=February 4, 2013|work= New York Times|accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/04/baltimore-ravens-win-super-bowl-xlvii|title= Ravens survive 49ers comeback and power failure to win Super Bowl|date=February 4, 2013|work= Guardian UK|accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}</ref> After play resumed, San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead, 28\u201323, and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34\u201329, the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the [[two-minute warning]] but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Baltimore quarterback [[Joe Flacco]], who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP.\n\n====2013====\n{{main article|2013 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nComing off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. The Ravens started out 3-2, and started the 2-0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30-9 in Week 3. However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 18-24.\n\nAfter winning and losing their next game, the Baltimore Ravens came out 4-6, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19-3 in Baltimore, a Steelers win 20-22 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29-26, and a 18-16 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker's 61-yard game-winning field goal. The Ravens were 8-6, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.\n\n====2014====\n{{main article|2014 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nOn January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]] to be their new offensive coordinator after [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] accepted the new available head coaching job with the [[Detroit Lions]]. On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fianc\u00e9e Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at [[Revel Atlantic City|Revel Casino]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Celebrity news website [[TMZ]] posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer's body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the [[2014 NFL season]] on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.\n\nIn Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], 23-16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, [[TMZ]] released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL. Although starting out 0-1 for two straight seasons and having received unwanted media attention for the Ray Rice incident, on September 11, 2014, the Ravens rallied back and beat the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 26-6, to improve to 1-1. In Week 12, the Ravens traveled down for an interconference battle with the [[New Orleans Saints]], which the Ravens won 34-27, reaching a 4-0 sweep of the NFC south. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Joe Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, falling to the Texans 25-13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10-3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points, winning 20-10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons, and the first since winning Super Bowl XLVII.\n\nIn the wildcard playoff game, the Ravens won 30-17 against their divisional rivals, the [[2014 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], at [[Heinz Field]]. In the next game in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35-31, ending their season.\n\n====2015====\n{{main article|2015 Baltimore Ravens season}}\n\nThe 2015 season marked 20 seasons of the franchise's existence competing in the NFL, which the franchise recognized with a special badge being worn on their uniforms during the 2015 NFL season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/04/23/ravens-unveil-special-20th-anniv-logo-for-2015-season/ |title=Ravens Unveil Special 20th Anniv.

However, they lost key players such as Joe Flacco, [[Justin Forsett]], Terrell Suggs, Steve Smith Sr., and Eugene Monroe to season-ending injuries.  Injuries and their inability to win close games early in the season led to the first losing season in the John Harbaugh-Flacco era.\n\n====2016====\n{{main article|2016 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nThe 2016 Ravens improved on their 5\u201311 record from [[2015 Baltimore Ravens season|2015]], finishing 8\u20138, but failed to qualify the playoffs for the second straight year. They were eliminated from playoff contention after their Week 16 loss to their division rivals, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]. This was the first time the Ravens missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons since [[2004 Baltimore Ravens season|2004]]\u2013[[2005 Baltimore Ravens season|2005]], as well as the first in the Harbaugh/Flacco era.\n\n====2017====\n{{main article|2017 Baltimore Ravens season}}\nThe Ravens improved upon their 8-8 record in 2016 by one win, finishing the season 9-7 and missing the playoffs for the third year in a row. This marked the first time the Ravens failed to make the playoffs in three straight seasons since the team's first three years of existence (1996-1998). The Ravens suffered a heartbreaking loss at home to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the final game of the season that prevented them from earning a playoff berth.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{see also|Ravens\u2013Steelers rivalry|Ravens\u2013Patriots rivalry|Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry|Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis}}\n\n[[File:Roethlisberger being sacked.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] sacked by [[Bart Scott]] and [[Jarret Johnson]]. [[Terrell Suggs]] looks on.]]\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\nBy far the team's biggest rival is the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along [[Interstate 70]]. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the [[AFC North]], and have met four times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to 3 points or less.\nThe rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the [[National Football League|NFL]] today.\n\n===Indianapolis Colts===\nAlthough the Steelers rivalry is based on mutual respect and antagonism for each other, the Ravens' rivalry with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] is fueled by the fans' animosity towards the organization, not contention between the players. This is due to the fact that the then-Colts owner, Robert Irsay, under the threat of eminent domain from the city of Baltimore, was forced to sneak the Colts out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to take them to Indianapolis. During Ravens home games the scoreboard lists the away team simply as \"Away\" or \"Indy\" rather than the team name that is traditionally used for the visiting opponent. The PA announcer will also refer to the Colts as the Indianapolis Professional Football Team; although on January 6, 2013 the scoreboard at the playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and Indianapolis Colts at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] listed the away team as \"Colts\". The Indianapolis Colts hold an all-time 9\u20134 advantage over the Baltimore Ravens, including a 2\u20131 advantage in the playoffs.\n\n===Other AFC North  rivals===\n[[File:BJ Sams.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[B.

The rivalry with the Browns has been very one-sided; Baltimore holds an advantage of 27-9 against Cleveland.\n\nThe rivalry with Cincinnati has been closer, with the Ravens and Bengals tying the all-time series 22-22 as of Week 17 of the 2017 NFL Season.\n\n===New England Patriots===\nThe Ravens first met the [[New England Patriots]] in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27\u201324 loss in the Patriots [[2007 New England Patriots season|quest for perfection]]. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27\u201321 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] and Ravens linebacker [[Terrell Suggs]]. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Brady, Terrell Suggs Trash Talk After Game|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/18/tom-brady-terrell-suggs-trash-talk_n_766980.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>  The Ravens faced the Patriots in a 2009 AFC wild card playoff game and won 33\u201314; the Ravens ran the ball for more than 250 yards.\n\nThe Ravens faced the Patriots in Week 6 of the 2010 season; the Ravens ended up losing 23\u201320 in overtime; the game caused controversy due to a hit to the helmet of tight end [[Todd Heap]] by Patriots safety [[Brandon Meriweather]].<ref>Ryan Hudson, [http://boston.sbnation.com/new-england-patriots/2010/10/19/1761235/brandon-meriweather-shit-todd-heap-nfl-helmet-concussion Brandon Meriweather Says Hit On Todd Heap Was 'Split-Second Decision'], ''SB Nation''. Retrieved October 28, 2012.</ref>\n\nThe Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season, in the 2011 AFC championship game in which the Ravens lost 23\u201320.  The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs.  The Ravens clawed to a 20\u201316 lead in the fourth quarter but Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] dove into the end zone to make the score 23\u201320 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens last possession of the game, quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] threw a pass to wide receiver [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]] in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last second strip by [[Sterling Moore]] forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens [[placekicker]] [[Billy Cundiff]]. With eleven seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt by a very wide margin, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to [[Super Bowl XLVI]].\n\nThe Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012.  The game was emotional as receiver [[Torrey Smith]] was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paolantonio|first=Sal|title=Big game for emotional Torrey Smith|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8416267/brother-baltimore-Ravens-wr-torrey-smith-dies-accident|publisher=ESPN|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref> Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13\u20130 deficit in the first half and led 14\u201313, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20\u201314 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30\u201321 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on [[Devin McCourty]] put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker [[Justin Tucker]] booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as [[Bill Belichick]] angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.\n\nThe two teams met again on January 20, 2013 in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28\u201313. The Patriots led at halftime, 13\u20137, but the Ravens' defense gave up no points in the second half. It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.\n\nOn December 22, 2013, the teams met again, this rematch of the AFC championship game was a mismatch from the outset. New England took a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter and never let up behind a defense that forced four turnovers and had four sacks. New England would go on to win the game 41-7.\n\nOn January 10, 2015, the two teams would meet in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Unlike the previous meeting, the Ravens put up a strong offensive performance, leading by 14 points twice in the game. However, Tom Brady would bring the Patriots back by attacking the Ravens vulnerable secondary and taking a 35-31 lead late in the 4th quarter. Joe Flacco would drive to the Patriots side of the field with under two minutes to play in regulation. However, a key interception by Flacco due to a misplay on the ball by Torrey Smith essentially sealed the game in the Patriots favor to send them to the AFC Championship.\n\n==Logo controversy==\n\nThe team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through 1998, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter ''B'' framed by the word ''Ravens'' overhead and a [[cross bottony]] underneath. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed a jury verdict that the logo [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] on a [[copyright]] retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, but that he was entitled to only three dollars in damages from the NFL.\n\nBouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=4th&navby=case&no=991617P&exact=1|title=FindLaw's United States Fourth Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}</ref> Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.<ref>Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Football Club, 346 F.3d 514, 519 (4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied 541 U.S. 1042 (2004) (\"The damages trial was conducted over a period of six days, from July 17 to 24, 2002. On July 23, 2002, at the close of the evidence, the jury was asked to decide whether the Defendants had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues were attributable entirely to factors other than the Defendants' infringement of Bouchat's copyright. If the jury found that they were not, then it was charged to decide the percentage of the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues attributable to factors other than the infringement. After a full day of deliberations, the jury answered the first question in the affirmative, thereby denying Bouchat any monetary recovery.\")</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. [[Art Modell]] announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter ''B'' to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo, introduced in 1999, featured a raven's head in profile with the letter superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of [[heraldry]]. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Baltimore]]) are interlocked with stylized letters ''B'' and ''R''.\n\n==Uniforms==\nThe design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] 1995 dream season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidenu.com/2013/09/24/the-strange-story-of-the-modell-bowl/ |title=The Strange Story of \"The Modell Bowl\" |work=insidenu.com |date=February 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222175841/http://www.insidenu.com/2013/09/24/the-strange-story-of-the-modell-bowl/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}</ref> Helmets are black with purple \"talon\" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games. At home games the combination of black pants with purple jersey made the Ravens the first NFL team to wear dark colors head to calf. A number of NFL teams have since donned the look, beginning with the all-black home uniform worn in three games by the 2001 [[New Orleans Saints]].\n\nIn 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season.\n\nIn the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener and, occasionally, other early games in the season that have a 1:00 kickoff. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.\n\nIn November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the [[Cleveland Browns]], entitled \"Pitch Black\" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.\n\nThe Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the [[Washington Redskins]], the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the \"blackout\" look.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/Ravens/blog/2010/06/back_in_black_1.html |title=Back in black |work=Ravens Insider |date=June 10, 2010 }}</ref> However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30\u201324 victory over the New Orleans Saints.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boards.baltimoreRavens.com/topic/22806-Ravens-alternate-black-jersey-dates-for-2010-announced/|title=Ravens Alternate Black Jerseys for 2010 Announced |work=BaltimoreRavens.com |date=December 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. in 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season.)\n\nOn December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' telecast.  The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13\u201310. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20\u201314. They wore this combination a third time against the [[Houston Texans]] on January 15, 2012 in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20\u201313. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|AFC Wild Card playoff]] and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24-9.\n\nFrom their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Downing|first=Garrett|title=Ravens Wearing Gold Pants, Purple Jerseys Sunday|url=http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/Ravens-Wearing-Gold-Pants-Purple-Jerseys-Sunday/9aac71c1-9134-4485-855a-7f632f590010|publisher=Baltimore Ravens|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref> Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on [[social media]] by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants, and mustard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=What was up with those gold-tinged Ravens pants?|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000607181/article/what-was-up-with-those-goldtinged-ravens-pants|publisher=National Football League|date=December 22, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Edholm|first=Eric|title=Did Ravens rob rival Steelers' closets for this week's pants?|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/did-ravens-rob-rival-steelers--closets-for-this-week-s-pants-183902863.html|publisher=Yahoo!

The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]] and had both teams where them in each. The [[2016 NFL season|following season]], the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas]]. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in [[2016 Baltimore Ravens season|2016]]; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28-7 over the division rival [[2016 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]]. They had one other Thursday Night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40-0 over the [[2017 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. In their Christmas 2016 game against the [[2016 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms.\n\nOn September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], wearing white jerseys with purple pants. The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the [[New Orleans Saints]], the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms.\n\n==Marching band==\n{{main article|Baltimore's Marching Ravens}}\nThe team marching band is called [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]]. They began as the Colts' marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947 to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed \"the band that would not die\" and were the subject of [[The Band that Wouldn't Die|an episode]] of ESPN's ''[[30 for 30]]''. The [[Washington Redskins]] are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.\n\n==Players of note==\n{{Category see also|Baltimore Ravens players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Baltimore Ravens roster}}\n'''Note''': The following lists players who officially played for the Ravens.

It is headquartered in [[Wigton]], [[Cumbria]], and its current leader is [[Adam Walker (British politician)|Adam Walker]]. A [[minor party]], it has no elected representatives at any level of UK government. Founded in 1982, the party reached its heyday in the 2000s, when it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the [[London Assembly]], and two [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]].\n\nTaking its name from that of a [[British National Party (1960)|defunct 1960s far-right party]], the BNP was created by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and other former members of the fascist [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF). During the 1980s and 1990s, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly. Instead, it focused on street marches and rallies, creating the [[Combat 18]] paramilitary\u2014its name a reference to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]\u2014to protect its events from [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] protesters. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership, and ousted him in 1999. The new leader [[Nick Griffin]] sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by presenting a more moderate image, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being ousted in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically, groups like [[Britain First]] had splintered off, and the [[English Defence League]] had supplanted it as the UK's foremost far-right group.\n\nIdeologically positioned on the extreme or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] by [[political science|political scientists]]. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]. The party is [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]], and it espouses the view that only [[white people]] should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and for non-white Britons to be stripped of citizenship and removed from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although since 1999 has advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes [[scientific racism|biological racism]] and the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]], calling for global [[racial segregation|racial separatism]] and condemning [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]]. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] and [[Holocaust denial]], promoting the [[conspiracy theory]] that [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Jews seek to dominate the world]] through both [[communism]] and international [[capitalism]]. Under Griffin, the party's focus switched from anti-semitism towards [[Islamophobia]]. It promotes [[economic protectionism]], [[Euroscepticism]], and a transformation away from [[liberal democracy]], while its social policies oppose [[feminism]], [[LGBT rights]], and [[permissive society|societal permissiveness]].\n\nThe BNP has a highly centralised structure that gives its chairman near-total control. It established a range of sub-groups\u2014such as a youth wing, record label, and trade union\u2014and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history, the BNP attracted most support from within [[White British]] working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. More widely, it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members are banned from a number of professions, and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured a ban on the party.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the British National Party}}\n\n===John Tyndall's leadership: 1982\u20131999===\n[[File:Yorkshire NF.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Photograph of people carrying [[Union Flag]]s, demonstrating outside a factory.|A [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] march from the 1970s, the movement from which the BNP emerged by 1982.]]\nThe British National Party (BNP){{refn|The name British National Party had been used in politics by four organisations,{{sfn|Husbands|1983|p=19}} most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]].

Following an argument with senior party member [[Martin Webster]], he resigned from the NF in 1980.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=21\u201323|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=24}} In June 1980 Tyndall established

Griffin inaugurated a period of change in the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nInfluenced by Le Pen's National Front in France, Griffin sought to widen the BNP's appeal to individuals who were concerned about immigration but had not previously voted for the extreme-right.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=123|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} The BNP replaced Tyndall's policy of compulsory

[[biological racism]] and stressed the cultural incompatibility of different racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}} This emphasis on culture allowed it to foreground [[Islamophobia]], and following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 it launched a \"Campaign Against Islam\".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It stressed the claim that the BNP was \"''not'' a

a diverse array of social and economic issues.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from ''British Nationalist'' to ''The Voice of Freedom'', and established a new journal, ''Identity''.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=114}} The party developed community-based campaigns,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} through which it targeted local issues,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=73}} For instance, in [[Burnley]] it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=74}} In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing [[graffiti]] while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=74|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=134}}\n\nGriffin believed that [[Peak Oil]] and a growth in Third World migrants arriving in Britain would result in a BNP government coming to power by 2040.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=170}} \nThe close of the twentieth century produced more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=9\u201310}} In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=10}} In July 2000, it came second in the [[Bexley London Borough Council elections#1998-2002|council

surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=133\u2013134}} This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=11}} In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2003|2003 local elections]]

its place.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nAfter Griffin took control of the party, it made increasing use of [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] themes in order to emphasise its \"British\" credentials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} In its published material, the party made appeals to the idea of Britain and Britishness in a manner not dissimilar to mainstream political parties.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=41}} In this material it has also made prominent use of the [[Union flag]] and the colours red, white, and blue.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=42}} Roger Griffin noted that the terms \"Britain\" and \"England\" appear \"confusingly interchangeable\" in BNP literature,{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} while Copsey has pointed out that the BNP's form of British nationalism is \"Anglo-centric\".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=163}} The party employed militaristic rhetoric under both Tyndall and Griffin's leadership; under the latter for example its published material spoke of a \"war without uniforms\" and a \"war for our survival as a people\".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=165}} Tyndall described the BNP as a revolutionary party,{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=82}} calling it a \"guerrilla army operating in occupied territory\".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}}\n\n===Ethnic nationalism and biological racism===\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The British National Party exists to secure a

to [[scientific racism|biological racist]] ideas,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} displaying an obsession with the perceived differences of racial groups.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=48}} Both Tyndall and Griffin believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned \"British race\" which was one branch of a wider [[Nordic race]],{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=88, 163}} a view akin to those of earlier fascists like Hitler and [[Arnold Leese]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}}\n\nThe BNP adheres to an ideology of [[ethnic nationalism]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to \"the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society\".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} This is a group that Griffin referred to as the \"home people\" or \"the folk\".{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=191}} According to Tyndall, \"The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism.\"{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} Richard Edmonds in 1993 told ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)|Duncan Campbell]] that \"we [the BNP] are 100% racist\".<ref>Quoted in Gabriel, John ''Whitewash: Radicalized Politics and the Media'', Routledge, 1998, p.158</ref> The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as \"British\", and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as \"Black Britons\" or \"Asian Britons\", instead describing them as \"racial foreigners\".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}\n\n[[File:Nick Griffin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|On taking over the party, Nick Griffin dropped its official espousal of the biological superiority of a Nordic race, instead emphasising the need for racial separatism to preserve global \"ethno-pluralism\"]]\n\nTyndall believed the white British and the broader Nordic race to be superior to other races,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} and under his leadership, the BNP promoted [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims in support of [[white supremacy]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=38}} Following Griffin's ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} Instead it foregrounded an \"[[Ethnopluralism|ethno-pluralist]]\" racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=160|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} This switch in focus owed much to the discourse of the French [[Nouvelle Droite]] movement which had emerged within France's extreme-right during the 1960s.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}}\nAt the same time the BNP switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the [[cultural racism|cultural incompatibility of racial groups]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as \"[[multiculturalism]]\",{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=62}} characterising this as a form of \"cultural genocide\",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}} and claiming that it promoted the interests of non-whites at the expense of the white British population.{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=64}} However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin's leadership demonstrated that\u2014despite the shift in its public statements\u2014it remained privately committed to biological racist ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}\n\nThe party emphasises what it sees as the need to protect the racial purity of the white British.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} It condemns [[miscegenation]] and \"race mixing\", claiming that this is a threat to the British race.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=38|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=48}} Tyndall stated that he \"felt deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage\" but had \"no sympathy whatsoever for the parents\".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=89\u201390}} Griffin similarly stated that mixed-race children were \"the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism\", and that the party would not \"accept miscegenation as moral or normal ... we never will\".{{sfn|Sutton|Perry|2009|p=91}} In its 1983 election manifesto, the BNP stated that \"family size is a private matter\" but still called for white Britons who are \"of intelligent, healthy and industrious stock\" to have large families and thus raise the white British birth-rate.{{sfn|Durham|1995|p=283}} The encouragement of high birth rates among white British families continued under Griffin's leadership.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}}\n\nUnder Tyndall's leadership, the BNP promoted [[eugenics]], calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=90|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=38}} In party literature, it talked of improving the British 'racial stock' by removing \"inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British

THE JEWS?\"{{sfnm|1a1=Billig|1y=1978|1p=128|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} Tyndall added [[Holocaust denial]] to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the [[Holocaust]] was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination.{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=92|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=39}} Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, ''[[Who are the Mind Benders?]]''{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in ''The Rune'', a magazine produced by the [[Croydon]] BNP.

discourse from the party.{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=26}} He informed party members that \"we can get away with criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide\".{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}} In 2006, he complained that the \"obsession\" that many BNP members had with \"the Jews\" was \"insane and politically disastrous\".{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=25}} In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=42}} References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} For instance, the term \"[[Zionism|Zionists]]\" was often used in party literature as a euphemism for \"Jews\".{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=39|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments \"within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse\".{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=36}} The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nUnder Griffin, the BNP's website linked to other web pages that explicitly portrayed immigration as part of a Jewish conspiracy,{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=53\u201354}} while it also sold books that promoted Holocaust denial.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=54\u201355}} In 2004, secretly filmed footage was captured in which Griffin was seen claiming that \"the Jews simply bought the West, in terms of press and so on, for their own political ends\".{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} Sectors of the extreme-right were highly critical of Griffin's softening on the subject of the Jews, claiming that he had \"sold out\" to the '[[Zionist Occupied Government]]'.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}} In 2006, John Blean, editor of ''Identity'', included an article in which he reassured BNP members that the party had not \"sold out to the Jews\" or \"embraced Zionism\" but that it remained \"committed to fighting... subversive

from the party, complaining that it still contained Holocaust deniers and Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Macklin|Virchow|2011|p=220}}\n\nGriffin informed BNP members that rather than \"bang on\" about the Jews\u2014which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular\u2014their party should focus on criticising [[Islam]], an issue that would be more resonant among the British public.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=85}} After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a \"Campaign Against Islam\" in September 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} In ''Islam: A Threat to Us All'', a leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and \"the threat that 'mainstream' Islam poses to our British culture\".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=41}} In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant [[Islamism|Islamists]]\u2014such as those who perpetrated the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]\u2014are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=710}} In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=721}} Griffin referred to Islam as an \"evil, wicked faith\",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=166}} and elsewhere publicly described it as a \"cancer\" that needed to be removed from Europe through \"chemotherapy\".{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=143}}\n\nThe BNP has called for the prohibition of immigration from Muslim countries and for the banning of the [[burqa|burka]], [[halal]] meat, and the building of new [[mosques]] in the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} It also called for the immediate deportation of radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] preachers from the country.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} In 2005 the party claimed that its primary issue of concern was the \"growth of fundamentalist-militant Islam in the UK and its ever-increasing threat to Western civilization and our implicit values\".{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} To broaden its anti-Islamic agenda, Griffin's BNP made overtures to the UK's Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities; Griffin's claim that Jews can make \"good allies\" in the fight against Islam caused controversy within the international far-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n===Government===\n\nTyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a \"doctrine of decay and degeneration\".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}} Under Tyndall, the party sought to dismantle the UK's liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what it sought to replace this system with.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} In his 1988 work ''The Eleventh Hour'', Tyndall wrote of the need for \"an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority\".{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} Tyndall's BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]] in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=84}} It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament produced a [[vote of no confidence]] in them.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} It stated that rather than having political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=85\u201386}} During the period of Griffin's leadership, the party downplayed its anti-democratic themes and instead foregrounded [[populism|populist]] ones.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=69\u201370}} Its campaign material called for the devolution of greater powers to local communities, the reestablishment of [[county councils]], and the introduction of citizens' initiative referendums based on those used in

wider 'British race'.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} Tyndall also led the BNP in support of [[Ulster loyalism]], for instance by holding public demonstrations against the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]],{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} and endorsing Ulster loyalist paramilitaries.{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=267}} Under Griffin, the BNP continued to support Ulster's membership of the United Kingdom, calling for the crushing of the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the scrapping of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} Griffin later expressed the view that \"the only solution that could possibly be acceptable to loyalists and republicans alike\" would be the reintegration of the Irish Republic into the United Kingdom, which would be reorganised along [[federalism|federal]] lines.{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=208}} However, while retaining the party's commitment to Ulster loyalism, under Griffin the importance of the issue was downplayed, something that was

view that \"politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces\".{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=93}} His approach rejected [[economic liberalism]] because it did not serve \"the national interest\", although still saw advantages in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, looking favourably on individual enterprise.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=94\u201395}} He called on capitalist elements to be combined with [[socialism|socialist]] ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an [[autarky]] which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} This attitude was heavily informed by the [[corporatism|corporatist]] system that had been introduced in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Fascist Italy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=96}}\n\nA number of senior members, including Griffin and [[John Bean]], had [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] leanings, having

Conversely, many older voters came of age during the 1970s, under the impact of the anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Powellism, Thatcherism, and the NF, and thus have less tolerant attitudes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=102, 104}}\n\nMost BNP voters had no formal qualifications and the party's support was centred largely in areas with low educational attainment.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} According to the 2002\u201306 data, two-thirds of BNP voters had either no formal qualifications or had left education after their [[O-levels]]/[[GCSE]]s.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Only one in ten BNP voters possessed an [[A-level]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} and an even smaller percentage had a university degree.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Most of the BNP's voting base were from the financially insecure lower classes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Research conducted from 2002 to 2006 indicated that seven out of ten BNP voters were either skilled or unskilled workers or unemployed.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} A 2009 poll found that six out of ten BNP voters fitted this profile.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Goodwin suggested that it was the skilled working classes rather than their unskilled or unemployed neighbours who were the main support base behind the BNP, because they owned some assets and thus felt that they had more to lose as a result of the economic threat posed by immigrants and ethnic minorities.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nResearch indicated that BNP voters also held opinions that were distinct from the average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}} In the 2002\u201306 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration to be the most important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=108, 100|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=142}} By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=110}} BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=108, 110}}\n\n[[File:Nick Griffin, talking to voters.jpg|thumb|left|BNP members campaigning in the London Borough of Havering in 2010]]\n\nBNP voters were also more likely than average to believe both that white Britons face unfair discrimination, and that Muslims, non-whites, and homosexuals had unfair advantages in British society.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} 78% of BNP voters endorsed the belief that the Labour Party prioritised immigrants and ethnic minorities over white British people, to 44% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} When asked questions about immigration and Muslims, BNP voters were found to be far more hostile to them than the average Briton, and also more willing than average to support outright racially discriminatory policies toward them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=112}} Copsey believed that \"popular racism\"\u2014namely against asylum seekers and Muslims\u2014generated the BNP's \"largest reservoir of support\",{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=146}} and that in many Northern English towns the main factors behind BNP support were white resentment toward Asian communities, anger at Asian-on-white crime, and the perception that Asians received disproportionately high levels of public funding.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nResearch also indicated that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002\u201306, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=113\u2013114}} Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and were also more likely than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=114}} There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=107\u2013108|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=144}}\n\nThe early stronghold of the BNP was in London, where it established enclaves of support in the boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Lewisham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets, with smaller units in Bexley, Camden, Greenwich, Hillingdon, Lambeth, and Redbridge.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=82}} By the late 1990s, the party was increasingly retreating from its original East End heartland, finding that its electoral support had declined in the area.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Griffin expressed the view that it was too dangerous for BNP activists to campaign in the East End, suggesting that they would likely be attacked by opponents.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Instead the party shifted its focus to parts of [[Outer London]], in particular the boroughs of Barking, Bexley, Dagenham, Greenwich, and Havering.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} After Griffin took power, the party focused on building support in the North of England, taking advantage of the anxieties generated by the ethnic riots that took place [[2001 Bradford riots|in Bradford]], Oldham, and Burnley in 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} In the period between 2002 and 2006, over 40% of the BNP's voters were in Northern England.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}}\n\nThe decline of the BNP as an electoral force around 2014 helped to open the way for the growth of another right-wing party, UKIP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=274}} In a study Goodwin produced with Robert Ford, the two political scientists noted that UKIP's support base mirrored the BNP's in that it had the same \"very clear social profile\": the \"old, male, working class, white and less educated\".{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=159}} One area where the two differed, they noted, was in the fact that BNP support had been highest among the middle-aged before tailing off among the over 55s, whereas UKIP retained strong support with those over 55. Ford and Goodwin suggested that this might be because more over 55s had \"direct or indirect experiences\" of the Second World War, in which Britain defeated the fascist powers, resulting in them being less inclined to support fascist parties than their younger counterparts.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=158}} Despite these commonalities, UKIP proved far more successful at mobilising these social groups than did the BNP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=175\u2013176}} This was likely in part because UKIP had a \"reputational shield\"; it emerged from within the Eurosceptic tradition of British politics rather than from the far-right and thus, while often ridiculed by the mainstream, was regarded as a legitimate democratic actor in a way that the BNP was not.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\n==Organisation and structure==\n\nOn its formation, the BNP avoided the National Front's committee-rule system of collective leadership in the hope of evading the infighting and factionalism that had damaged the NF.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead it was founded around what it called the \"leadership principle\", with a central chairman having complete control over the party, which was then arranged in a highly hierarchical structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=30|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=77}} The BNP lacked any internal democracy, with the grassroots membership having no formal powers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} On taking power, Griffin retained the leadership principle inherited from Tyndall.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} He nevertheless established an Advisory Council which would meet several times a year; the members were to be selected by Griffin himself and would serve as his advisors.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=108|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=79}}\n\nThe party's branches and local groups were referred to as \"units\" within the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} It had no full-time staff and for most of the 1980s lacked a telephone number.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=89}} When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party's activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Griffin tried to build a more professional party machine by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=88}} He launched an \"annual college\" for activists in 2001 and formed an education and training department in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} In 2008 and 2010 he oversaw the establishment of \"summer schools\" for high-ranking officials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} The party also began employing full-time members of staff, having three in 2001 and 13 in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}}\n\nTo incentivise members to remain committed to the party, Griffin followed the example of the Swedish [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] by implementing a new \"voting membership\" scheme in 2007.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=171|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=90}} This meant that those who had been BNP members for two years could become a \"voting member\", at which they would go on a year's probation.

By the mid-1990s, the BNP's attempts to stage public events in Scotland, the North West and the Midlands were largely thwarted by the militant disruption of the [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (AFA) group.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|p=128}} The BNP's modernisation and move away from street demonstrations and toward electoral campaigning caused problems for the AFA, who proved unable to successfully change their tactics; on those occasions when AFA activists tried to forcibly disrupt BNP activities, they were prevented and arrested by [[riot police]].{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=129\u2013131}}\n\n[[File:London MMB 09 University College.jpg|thumb|left|Activists belonging to the far-left [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] protesting against the BNP at [[University College London]] in 2009]]\n\nMore liberal sections of the anti-fascist movement sought to counter the BNP through community-based initiatives. ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' encouraged trade unions to establish localised campaigns that would ensure that ethnic minority and other anti-BNP locals voted. It suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which BNP voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out Islamic fundamentalists and extremists active in the area.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=131\u2013133}} The [[Unite Against Fascism]] group also sought to maximise anti-BNP turnout at elections, calling on the electorate to vote for \"anyone but fascists\".{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=134\u2013135}} Evidence suggests that such anti-fascist activities did little to erode the far-right vote; this was in part because anti-fascist groups had encouraged the stereotype that BNP candidates were violent skinheads, something which conflicted with the more normal, friendly image that BNP activists cultivated when canvassing.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=140, 141}}\n\nThe BNP often received a hostile response from other sections of the British extreme-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=103}} Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party's inability to moderate itself further on the issue of race, while those such as [[Colin Jordan]] and the NF accused the BNP\u2014particularly under Griffin's leadership\u2014of being too moderate.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|pp=103\u2013104}} This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right [[groupuscule]], the International Third Position, when it claimed that the BNP \"has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group\".{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}}\n\nIn ''[[ASLEF v.

The bodyguard, Indus, was of the Batavian tribe.]]\nThe '''Batavi''' were an ancient [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] tribe that lived around the modern [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Rhine]] delta in the area that the Romans called [[Batavia (region)|Batavia]], from the second half of the first century BC to the third century AD. The name is also applied to several military units employed by the Romans that were originally raised among the Batavi. The tribal name, probably a derivation from ''batawj\u014d'' (\"good island\", from [[Germanic Languages|Germanic]] ''bat-'' \"good, excellent,\" which is also in the English \"better,\" and ''awj\u014d'' \"island, land near water\"),<ref>Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/Batawj\u014d [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/Batawj%C5%8D0]</ref> refers to the region's fertility, today known as the ''fruitbasket of the [[Netherlands]]'' (the [[Betuwe]]).\n\nFinds of [[Wax tablet|wooden tablets]] show that at least some were literate.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Germania_70_de.svg|frameless|340px|left]]\nThe Batavi themselves are not mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in his commentary ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', although he is often thought to have founded his dynasty's [[Numerus Batavorum|Germanic bodyguard]], which was at least in later generations dominated by Batavi. But he did mention the \"Batavian island\" in the [[Rhine river]]. The island's easternmost point is at a split in the Rhine, one arm being the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] the other the [[Nederrijn|Lower Rhine]]/[[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (hence the Latin name ''Insula Batavorum'', \"Island of the Batavi\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C. Julius Caesar, Gallic War, Book 4, chapter 10|work=tufts.edu}}</ref> Much later [[Tacitus]] wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the [[Chatti]], a tribe in Germany also never mentioned by Caesar (unless they were his \"[[Suebi]]\"), who were forced by internal dissension to move to their new home.<ref>Cornelius Tacitus, ''Germany and its Tribes'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0083%3Achapter%3D29 1.29]</ref> The time when this happened is unknown, but Caesar does describe forced movements of tribes from the east in his time, such as the [[Usipetes]] and [[Tencteri]].\n\nTacitus also reports that before their arrival the area had been \"an uninhabited district on the extremity of the coast of Gaul, and also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the river Rhine in the rear and on either side\".<ref>Tacitus, ''Historiae'' iv.12</ref> This view, however, is contradicted by the archeological evidence, which shows continuous habitation from at least the third century BC onward.<ref>N. Roymans, \"The Lower Rhine ''Triquetrum'' Coinages and the Ethnogenesis of the Batavians\", in: T. Gr\u00fcnewald & H.-J. Schalles (eds.), ''Germania Inferior: Besiedlung, Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft an der Grenze der r\u00f6misch-germanischen Welt'' (2000), 93-145, esp. 94.</ref>  \n  \nThe strategic position, to wit the high bank of the Waal offereing an unimpeded view far into Germania Transrhenana (Germania Beyond the Rhine), was recognized first by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], who built a massive fortress (''castra'') and a headquarters (''praetorium'') in imperial style. The latter was in use until the Batavian revolt.\n\nArcheological evidence suggests they lived in small villages, composed of six to 12 houses in the very fertile lands between the rivers, and lived by agriculture and cattle-raising. Finds of horse skeletons in graves suggest a strong equestrian preoccupation. On the south bank of the Waal (in what is now Nijmegen) a Roman administrative center was built, called ''Oppidum Batavorum''. An [[Oppidum]] was a fortified warehouse, where a tribe's treasures were stored and guarded. This centre was razed during the Batavian Revolt.\n\n==Military units==\n[[Image:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|''The Conspiracy of the Batavians under Claudius Civilis'' by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]\n\nThe first Batavi commander we know of is named [[Chariovalda]], who led a charge across the V\u012bsurgis ([[Weser]]) river against the [[Cherusci]] led by Arminius during the campaigns of Germanicus in ''Germania Transrhenana''.<ref>Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#11|2.11]]</ref>\n\nTacitus (''[[De origine et situ Germanorum]]'' XXIX) described the Batavi as the bravest of the tribes of the area, hardened in the Germanic wars, with cohorts under their own commanders transferred to [[Britannia]]. They retained the honour of the ancient association with the Romans, not required to pay tribute or taxes and used by the Romans only for war: \"They furnished to the Empire nothing but men and arms\", Tacitus remarked. Well regarded for their skills in horsemanship and swimming&mdash;for men and horses could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. [[Dio Cassius]] describes this surprise tactic employed by [[Aulus Plautius]] against the \"barbarians\"&mdash;the British Celts&mdash; at the [[Battle of the Medway|battle of the River Medway]], 43:\n\n<blockquote>The barbarians thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of Germanic tribesmen, who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. [...] Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found; but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the Germans swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them. (Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book 60:20)</blockquote>\nIt is uncertain how they were able to accomplish this feat. The late 4th century writer on Roman military affairs Vegetius mentions soldiers using reed rafts, drawn by leather leads, to transport equipment across rivers.<ref>Vegetius ''De re militari'' III.7</ref> But the sources suggest the Batavi were able to swim across rivers actually wearing full armour and weapons. This would only have been possible by the use of some kind of buoyancy device: [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] mentions that the ''[[Cornuti]]'' regiment swam across a river floating on their shields \"as on a canoe\" (357).<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] XVI.11</ref> Since the shields were wooden, they may have provided sufficient buoyancy\n\nThe Batavi were used to form the bulk of the Emperor's personal [[Germanic bodyguard]] from [[Augustus]] to [[Galba]]. They also provided a contingent for their indirect successors, the Emperor's horse guards, the ''[[Equites singulares Augusti]]''.\n\nA Batavian contingent was used in an amphibious assault on [[Anglesey|Ynys Mon (Anglesey)]], taking the assembled [[Druids]] by surprise, as they were only expecting Roman ships.<ref>Tacitus Agricola 18.3-5</ref>\n\nNumerous altars and tombstones of the cohorts of Batavi, dating to the 2nd century and 3rd century, have been found along [[Hadrian's Wall]], notably at [[Castlecary]] and [[Carrawburgh]], [[Germany]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Austria]].\n\n===Revolt of the Batavi===\n{{main|Revolt of the Batavi}}\nDespite the alliance, one of the high-ranking Batavi, Julius Paullus, to give him his Roman name, was executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. His kinsman [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] was paraded in chains in Rome before [[Nero]]; though he was acquitted by [[Galba]], he was retained at Rome, and when he returned to his kin in the year of upheaval in the Roman Empire, 69, he headed a Batavian rebellion. He managed to capture [[Castra Vetera]], the Romans lost two legions while two others (I Germanica and XVI Gallica) were controlled by the rebels. The rebellion became a real threat to the Empire when the conflict escalated to northern Gaul and Germania. The Roman army retaliated and invaded the ''insula Batavorum''. A bridge was built over the river [[Nabalia]], where the warring parties approached each other on both sides to negotiate peace. The narrative was told in great detail in Tacitus' History, book iv, although, unfortunately, the narrative breaks off abruptly at the climax. Following the uprising, [[Legio X Gemina|Legio X ''Gemina'']] was housed in a stone ''castra'' to keep an eye on the Batavians.\n\n== Fate of the Batavi==\nThe Batavi were still mentioned in 355 during the reign of [[Constantius II]] (317 - 361), when their island was already dominated by the [[Salian Franks|Salii]], a Frankish tribe that had sought Roman protection there in 297 after having been expelled from their own country by the Saxons.\n\n[[Constantius Gallus]] added inhabitants of Batavia to his legions, \"of whose discipline we still make use.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus03_book3.htm|title=Zosimus, New History. London: Green and Chaplin (1814). Book 3.|work=tertullian.org}}</ref> It has been assumed they merged with the Salii shortly before or after and, after having been expelled by another tribe (it has been proposed this was the [[Chamavi]]), shared their subsequent migration to [[Toxandria]]. In the [[Late Roman army]] there was a unit called ''[[Batavi (military unit)|Batavi]]''.\n\nThe name of the Bavarian town of [[Passau]] descends from the Roman ''Batavis'', which was named after the Batavi. The town's name is old as it shows the typical effects of the [[High German consonant shift]] (b > p, t > ss).\n\n==The Batavian revival==\n{{main|History of the Netherlands#Batavians}}\nIn the 16th-century emergence of a popular foundation story and origin myth for the [[Dutch people]], the Batavians came to be regarded as their ancestors during their national struggle for independence during the [[Eighty Years War]].<ref>This section follows [[Simon Schama]], ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age]]'', (New York) 1987, ch.

The origin was perpetuated by Romeyn de Hooghe's ''Spiegel van Staat der Vereenigden Nederlanden'' (\"Mirror of the State of the United Netherlands,\" 1706), which also ran to many editions, and it was revived in the atmosphere of [[Romantic nationalism]] in the late eighteenth-century reforms that saw a short-lived [[Batavian Republic]] and, in the colony of the [[Dutch East Indies]], a capital that was named [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Though since Indonesian independence the city is called [[Jakarta]], its inhabitants up to the present still call themselves ''[[Betawi people |Betawi]]'' or ''[[Orang Betawi]]'', i.e. \"People of Batavia\" - a name ultimately derived from the ancient Batavians.<ref>{{cite book | title = Creole Identity in Postcolonial Indonesia.

Being politically and geographically inclusive, this historical vision filled the needs of Dutch nation-building and integration in the 1890-1914 era.\n\nHowever, a disadvantage of this historical nationalism soon became apparent. It suggested there were no strong external borders, while allowing for the fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three parts.

Likewise, Tertullian (AD 196\u2013212) allowed for varying approaches to baptism even if those practices did not conform to biblical or traditional mandates (cf. De corona militis 3; De baptismo 17). Finally, Cyprian (ca. AD 256) explicitly stated that the amount of water was inconsequential and defended immersion, affusion, and aspersion practices (Epistle 75.12).

Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of yesterday's Lecture, that you may learn of what those things, which were done by you in the inner chamber, were symbolic.\n\n2.

After these things, you were led to the holy pool of Divine Baptism, as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before our eyes. And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and you made that saving confession, and descended three times into the water, and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days burial of Christ.... And at the self-same moment you were both dying and being born;<ref>Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lecture 20 (On the Mysteries. II. of Baptism) {{Bibleref2|Romans|6:3\u201314}} http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310120.htm</ref>}}\n\nThe symbolism is threefold:\n\n1. Baptism is considered to be a form of rebirth\u2014\"by water and the Spirit\"<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:5}}</ref>\u2014the nakedness of baptism (the second birth) paralleled the condition of one's original birth. For example, St. John Chrysostom calls the baptism \"\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\", i.e., giving birth, and \"new way of creation...from water and Spirit\" (\"to John\" speech 25,2), and later elaborates:\n\n: {{Quote|For nothing perceivable was handed over to us by Jesus; but with perceivable things, all of them however conceivable. This is also the way with the baptism; the gift of the water is done with a perceivable thing, but the things being conducted, i.e., the rebirth and renovation, are conceivable. For, if you were without a body, He would hand over these bodiless gifts as naked [gifts] to you. But because the soul is closely linked to the body, He hands over the perceivable ones to you with conceivable things. (Chrysostom to Matthew., speech 82, 4, c. 390&nbsp;A.D.)}}\n\n2. The removal of clothing represented the \"image of putting off the old man with his deeds\" (as per Cyril, above), so the stripping of the body before for baptism represented taking off the trappings of sinful self, so that the \"new man\", which is given by Jesus, can be put on.\n[[File:Rosa Hagstr\u00f6m & Lars Ridderstedt II 1948.jpg|thumb|Long laced gown worn at a typical Lutheran baptism in Sweden in 1948]]\n3. As St. Cyril again asserts above, as Adam and Eve in scripture were naked, innocent and unashamed in the Garden of Eden, nakedness during baptism was seen as a renewal of that innocence and state of original sinlessness. Other parallels can also be drawn, such as between the exposed condition of Christ during His crucifixion, and the crucifixion of the \"old man\" of the repentant sinner in preparation for baptism.\n\nChanging customs and concerns regarding modesty probably contributed to the practice of permitting or requiring the baptismal candidate to either retain their undergarments (as in many Renaissance paintings of baptism such as those by da Vinci, Tintoretto, Van Scorel, Masaccio, de Wit and others) or to wear, as is almost universally the practice today, baptismal robes. These robes are most often white, symbolizing purity. Some groups today allow any suitable clothes to be worn, such as trousers and a T-shirt\u2014practical considerations include how easily the clothes will dry (denim is discouraged), and whether they will become see-through when wet.\n\n==Meaning and effects==\n[[File:Bapt\u00eame Cath\u00e9drale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]\nThere are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a [[sacrament]], and speak of \"[[baptismal regeneration]]\". Its importance is related to their interpretation of the meaning of the \"Mystical Body of Christ\" as found in the New Testament. This view is shared by the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] denominations, and by Churches formed early during the [[Protestant Reformation]] such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. For example, [[Martin Luther]] said:\n\n{{Quote|To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to \"be saved\". To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever.|''[[Luther's Large Catechism]]'', 1529}}\n\nThe [[Churches of Christ]],\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone\u2013Campbell Movement: Baptism\" />{{rp|p.66}}<ref name=\"Theology Matters\"/>{{rp|p.112}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and [[LDS Church]] also espouse baptism as necessary for salvation.\n\nFor Roman Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of the children of God (''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1212\u201313). It configures the person to Christ (CCC 1272), and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood ([[martyrdom]]). In his encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' of June 29, 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] spoke of baptism and profession of the true faith as what makes members of the one true Church, which is the body of Jesus Christ himself, as God the Holy Spirit has taught through the Apostle Paul:\n{{Quote|\n:'''18'''...''Through the waters of Baptism those who are born into this world dead in sin are not only born again and made members of the Church, but being stamped with a spiritual seal they become able and fit to receive the other Sacraments. ...''\n:'''22''' ''Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who have been baptized and profess the true faith, and who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed. 'For in one spirit' says the Apostle, 'were we all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free.' As therefore in the true Christian community there is only one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one Baptism, so there can be only one faith. And therefore if a man refuse to hear the Church let him be considered\u2014so the Lord commands\u2014as a heathen and a publican. It follows that those who are divided in faith or government cannot be living in the unity of such a Body, nor can they be living the life of its one Divine Spirit.'' |[http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12MYSTI.HTM ''Mystici corporis Christi'' (full text in an English translation)]}}\n\nBy contrast, [[Anabaptist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestants recognize baptism as an outward sign of an inward reality following on an individual believer's experience of forgiving grace. [[Reformed]] and [[Methodist]] Protestants maintain a link between baptism and regeneration, but insist that it is not automatic or mechanical, and that regeneration may occur at a different time than baptism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Faith of the Christian Church|last=Inbody|first=Tyron|year=2005|url=https://www.questia.com/read/119924426/the-faith-of-the-christian-church-an-introduction|publisher=William B.

Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do.\"<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone\u2013Campbell Movement: Baptism\" />{{rp|p.66}} Thus, they see baptism as a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it \"is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God\".<ref name=\"Theology Matters\">{{cite book |first1=Harold |last1=Hazelip |first2=Gary |last2=Holloway |first3=Randall J. |last3=Harris |first4=Mark C. |last4=Black |title=Theology Matters: In Honor of Harold Hazelip: Answers for the Church Today |publisher=College Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-89900-813-4}}</ref>{{rp|p.112}}\n\n===Christian traditions===\n[[File:BaptismalFontStRaphaelDubuque.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The baptistry at [[St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque)|St. Raphael's Cathedral]], [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], Iowa.

Eight-sided font architectures are common symbology of the day of Christ's Resurrection: the \"Eighth Day\".]]\nThe [[liturgy]] of baptism for Catholics, [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] makes clear reference to baptism as not only a symbolic burial and resurrection, but an actual supernatural transformation, one that draws parallels to the experience of [[Noah]] and the passage of the [[Israelites]] through the [[Red Sea]] divided by [[Moses]]. Thus, baptism is literally and symbolically not only cleansing, but also dying and rising again with Christ. Catholics believe baptism is necessary to cleanse the taint of [[original sin]], and so commonly baptise infants. The Eastern Churches ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) also baptize infants on the basis of texts, such as Matthew 19:14, which are interpreted as supporting full Church membership for children. In these denominations, baptism is immediately followed by [[Chrismation]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] at the next [[Divine Liturgy]], regardless of age. Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin of Adam.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Nicodemos the Hagiorite]] |title=Concerning Thoughts |work=Exomologetarion |url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx}}</ref> Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Methodists and Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.\n[[File:Baptism Jar (Portuguese period).JPG|thumb|Baptism Jar, used in [[Portuguese Ceylon]].]]\nEastern Orthodox Christians usually insist on complete threefold immersion as both a symbol of death and rebirth into Christ, and as a washing away of sin. [[Latin Church]] Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Eastern Catholics usually by submersion, or at least partial immersion. However, submersion is gaining in popularity within the Latin Catholic Church. In newer church sanctuaries, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baptism and Church Architecture|url=http://www.religiousproductnews.com/articles/2006-November/Feature-Articles/Baptism-and-Church-Architecture-.htm|website=Baptism and Church Architecture|publisher=Religious Product News|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> Anglicans baptize by submersion, immersion, affusion or sprinkling.\n\nAccording to evidence which can be traced back to at latest about the year 200,<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Tertullian]] |editor=[[Philip Schaff]] |title=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] |chapter=Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.vi.iii.xviii.html}}</ref> sponsors or godparents are present at baptism and vow to uphold the Christian education and life of the baptized.\n\nBaptists argue that the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03c9}} originally meant \"to immerse\".

If these key criteria are met, violation of some rules regarding baptism, such as varying the authorized rite for the ceremony, renders the baptism illicit (contrary to the church's laws) but still valid.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Ecumenical Proposal About The Sacraments|last=Bruno|first=Luciano|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nOne of the criteria for validity is use of the correct form of words. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb \"baptize\" is essential.<ref name=\"cathen\" /> Catholics of the [[Latin Church]], Anglicans and Methodists use the form \"I baptize you....\" Eastern Orthodox and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] use a [[passive voice]] form \"The Servant/(Handmaiden) of God is baptized in the name of....\" or \"This person is baptized by my hands....\"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nUse of the [[Trinitarian formula]] \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" is also considered essential; thus these churches do not accept as valid baptisms of non-[[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] churches such as [[Oneness Pentecostals]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAnother essential condition is use of water. A baptism in which some liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was used would not be considered valid.<ref name=Fanning/>\n\nAnother requirement is that the celebrant intends to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention \"to do what the Church does\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1256 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/DOCTRINE/INTENTIO.TXT |title=On the Intention Required in the Minister of the Sacraments |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome conditions expressly do not affect validity\u2014for example, whether submersion, immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized.

However, generally baptisms performed in the name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised in the name of the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another Christian confession (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by [[chrismation]] or, in rare circumstances, [[confession of faith]] alone as long as the baptism was done in the name of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit).

Baptism of blood is that undergone by unbaptized individuals who are [[martyr]]ed for their faith, while baptism of desire generally applies to [[catechumen]]s who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:\n\n<blockquote>The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This ''Baptism of blood'', like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)</blockquote>\n\nThe Catholic Church holds that those who are ignorant of Christ's Gospel and of the Church, but who seek the truth and do God's will as they understand it, may be supposed to have an implicit desire for baptism and can be saved: \"'Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.' Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved.

[[Robert Barclay]]'s ''Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' (a historic explanation of Quaker theology from the 17th century), explains Quakers' opposition to baptism with water thus:\n\n{{Quote|\"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire\".<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:11}}</ref> Here John mentions two manners of baptizings and two different baptisms, the one with water, and the other with the Spirit, the one whereof he was the minister of, the other whereof Christ was the minister of: and such as were baptized with the first were not therefore baptized with the second: \"I indeed baptize you, but he shall baptize you.\" Though in the present time they were baptized with the baptism of water, yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the baptism of Christ.|[[Robert Barclay]], 1678<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html |title=Apology, Proposition 12 |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=July 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090617033930/http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/prop12.html| archivedate= June 17, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Robert Barclay|Barclay]] argued that water baptism was only something that happened until the time of Christ, but that now, people are baptised inwardly by the spirit of Christ, and hence there is no need for the external sacrament of water baptism, which [[Quakers]] argue is meaningless.\n\n===Salvation Army===\nThe [[Salvation Army]] does not practice water baptism, or indeed other outward [[sacraments]]. [[William Booth]] and [[Catherine Booth]], the founders of the [[Salvation Army]], believed that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. They believed what was important was spiritual grace itself. However, although the [[Salvation Army]] does not practice baptism, they are not opposed to baptism within other Christian denominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |title=Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? |publisher=The Salvation Army |date=February 28, 1987 |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233651/http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki.nsf/vw-print/C28E39B2CA06E8F98025708A003D9FAC?openDocument |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hyperdispensationalism===\n<!-- This section is linked from Baptism-->\nThere are some Christians termed \"[[Hyperdispensationalism|Hyperdispensationalists]]\" (Mid-Acts dispensationalism) who accept only Paul's Epistles as directly applicable for the church today. They do not accept water baptism as a practice for the church since Paul who was God's apostle to the nations was not sent to baptize. Ultradispensationalists (Acts 28 dispensationalism) who do not accept the practice of the Lord's supper, do not practice baptism because these are not found in the Prison Epistles.<ref>\"Prison epistles\" include [[Ephesians]], [[Colossians]], [[Philippians]], and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]]</ref> Both sects believe water baptism was a valid practice for covenant Israel. Hyperdispensationalists also teach that Peter's gospel message was not the same as Paul's.<ref>{{cite web|first=David M. |last=Havard |title=Are We Hyper-Dispensationalists? |url=http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html |publisher=Berean Bible Society |accessdate=January 19, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204081633/http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/articles/1011392439.html| archivedate= February 4, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Hyperdispensationalists assert:\n\n*The great commission<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|28:18\u201320}}</ref> and its baptism is directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later.\n*The baptism of Acts 2:36\u201338 is Peter's call for Israel to repent of complicity in the death of their Messiah; not as a Gospel announcement of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin, a later doctrine revealed by Paul.\n\nWater baptism found early in the Book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism<ref>{{Bibleref2c|1cor|12:13||1 Cor 12:13}}</ref> foretold by John the Baptist.<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}, {{bibleref2|John|1:33}}, {{bibleref2|Matt|3:11}}{{bibleref2|Acts|1:5}}</ref> Others make a distinction between John's prophesied baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit's baptism of the believer into the body of Christ; the latter being the one baptism for today. The one baptism for today, it is asserted, is the \"baptism of the [[Holy Spirit]]\" of the believer into the Body of Christ church.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Ac|11:15\u201316}}</ref>\n\nMany in this group also argue that John's promised [[Baptized by fire|baptism by fire]] is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire.<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|3:12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|3:17}}, {{bibleref2|2|Pe|3:10||2 Peter 3:10}}</ref>\n\nJohn, as he said \"baptized with water\", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Jn|4:1\u20132}}</ref> Unlike Jesus' first apostles, Paul, his apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize<ref>{{bibleref2c|1Cor.|1:17||1 Co 1:17}}</ref> in contradiction to the Great Commission.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:19}}</ref> But Paul did occasionally still baptize Jews, for instance in Corinth<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|1Cor|1:14\u201316}}</ref> and in Philippi.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Ac|16:13}}</ref> He also taught the spiritual significance of Spirit baptism in identifying the believer with the atoning death of Christ, his burial, and resurrection.<ref>{{bibleref2c|Rom|6:4}}</ref> Romans 6 baptism does not mention nor imply water but is rather a real baptism into Christ's death.\n\nOther Hyperdispensationalists believe that baptism was necessary until mid-Acts. The great commission<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mt|28:18\u201320}}</ref> and its baptism was directed to early Jewish believers, not the Gentile believers of mid-Acts or later. Any Jew who believed did not receive salvation<ref>{{bibleref2c|Mk|16:16}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:21||1 Pe 3:21}}</ref> or the baptism of the Holy Spirit<ref name=\"bibleref2c|Ac|2:38\"/> until they were water baptized. This period ended with the calling of Paul.<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|9:17\u201318}}</ref> Peter's reaction when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit before baptism<ref>{{bibleref2c-nb|Ac|10:44\u201348}}</ref> is seen as proof of transition from water to Spirit baptism. Also significant is the lack of any instructions in the Acts 15 apostolic conference requiring Gentiles to be water baptized.\n\n===Debaptism===\n{{main|Debaptism}}\nMost Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.\n\n==Comparative summary==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Anglicanism]]-->\nComparative Summary of Baptisms of Denominations of Christian Influence.<ref>''Good News''.

He taught that in baptism a child was cleansed of the guilt of original sin, initiated into the covenant with God, admitted into the church, made an heir of the divine kingdom, and spiritually born anew. He said that while baptism was neither essential to nor sufficient for salvation, it was the \"ordinary means\" that God designated for applying the benefits of the work of Christ in human lives. On the other hand, although he affirmed the regenerating grace of infant baptism, he also insisted upon the necessity of adult conversion for those who have fallen from grace. A person who matures into moral accountability must respond to God's grace in repentance and faith. Without personal decision and commitment to Christ, the baptismal gift is rendered ineffective. <br /> ''Baptism as Forgiveness of Sin''. In baptism God offers and we accept the forgiveness of our sin (Acts 2:38). With the pardoning of sin which has separated us from God, we are justified\u2014freed from the guilt and penalty of sin and restored to right relationship with God. This reconciliation is made possible through the atonement of Christ and made real in our lives by the work of the Holy Spirit. We respond by confessing and repenting of our sin, and affirming our faith that Jesus Christ has accomplished all that is necessary for our salvation. Faith is the necessary condition for justification; in baptism, that faith is professed. God's forgiveness makes possible the renewal of our spiritual lives and our becoming new beings in Christ. <br /> ''Baptism as New Life''. Baptism is the sacramental sign of new life through and in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Variously identified as regeneration, new birth, and being born again, this work of grace makes us into new spiritual creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). We die to our old nature which was dominated by sin and enter into the very life of Christ who transforms us. Baptism is the means of entry into new life in Christ (John 3:5; Titus 3:5), but new birth may not always coincide with the moment of the administration of water or the laying on of hands. Our awareness and acceptance of our redemption by Christ and new life in him may vary throughout our lives. But, in whatever way the reality of the new birth is experienced, it carries out the promises God made to us in our baptism.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"By Water and the Spirit \u2013 Personal Faith\">{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&mid=992| title = By Water and the Spirit: A United Methodist Understanding of Baptism|publisher = [[The United Methodist Church]]|quote= The United Methodist Church does not accept either the idea that only believer's baptism is valid or the notion that the baptism of infants magically imparts salvation apart from active personal faith.|accessdate =August 2, 2007}}</ref>\n| Trinity\n|-\n| [[Metropolitan Community Church]]\n| Baptism is conducted in the order of worship.\n| sprinkling, pouring, or immersion\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Trinity\n|-\n| [[Moravian Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/Moravian/a/Moravian-Beliefs.htm |title=Moravian Church Beliefs Are Solidly Based On The Bible |publisher=Christianity.about.com |date=March 4, 2014 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n| The individual receives the pledge of the forgiveness of sins and admission through God's covenant through the blood of Jesus Christ\n| sprinkling, pour,  or immersion\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Trinity\n|-\n| [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarenes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/Nazarene-Church/a/Nazarene-Beliefs.htm |title=Nazarene \u2013 Distinctive Beliefs and Practices of the Church of the Nazarene |publisher=Christianity.about.com |date=March 4, 2014 |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> \n| Baptism signifies the acceptance of Christ Jesus as Saviour and are willingly to obey him righteously and in holiness.\n| sprinkling, pouring, or immersion\n| Yes\n| Yes\n| Trinity\n|-\n| [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness Pentecostals]]\n| Necessary for salvation because it conveys spiritual rebirth.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Nathan|title=What is the gospel message?

The candidate then fasted for ten days from meat and wine, after which he was dressed in linen and led at night into the innermost part of the sanctuary, where the actual initiation, the details of which were secret, took place.

Unlike [[lawn bowls]], bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   \nA game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the '''jack''' (called a ''{{lang|it|boccino}}'' ('little bocce') or ''{{lang|it|pallino}}'' ('bullet') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone {{convert|5|m|ft}} in length, ending {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.<ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>\n\nThe side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does ''not'' have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.<ref>[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch2.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 2 - Article 8 - Points to be Made and the Duration of the Match]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>\n\nPlayers are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.<ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n===Bocce volo===\n{{main|Bocce volo}}\nA variation called ''{{lang|it|bocce volo}}'' uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line.

Beatmatching is a component of '''beatmixing''' which employs beatmatching combined with equalization, attention to phrasing and track selection in an attempt to make a single mix that flows together and has a good structure.\n\nThe technique was developed to keep the people from leaving the dancefloor at the end of the song.  These days it is considered basic among disc jockeys (DJs) in [[electronic dance music]] genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle.\n\nBeatmatching is no longer considered a novelty, and new digital software has made the technique much easier to master.\n\n==Technique==\n\nThe beatmatching technique consists of the following steps:\n\n# While a record is playing, start a second record playing, but only monitored through headphones, not being fed to the main PA system.  Use [[gain (electronics)|gain]] (or ''trim'') control on the mixer to match the levels of the two records.\n# Restart and [[slip-cueing|slip-cue]] the new record at the right time, on beat with the record currently playing.\n# If the beat on the new record hits before the beat on the current record then the new record is too fast, reduce the pitch and manually slow the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync.\n# If the beat on the new record hits after the beat on the current record then the new record is too slow, increase the pitch and manually increase the speed of the new record to bring the beats back in sync.\n# Continue this process until the two records are in sync with each other. It can be difficult to sync the two records perfectly, so manual adjustment of the records is necessary to maintain the beat synchronization.\n# Gradually fade in parts of the new track while fading out the old track.  While in the mix, ensure that the tracks are still synchronized, adjusting the records if needed.\n# The fade can be repeated several times, for example, from the first track, fade to the second track, then back to first, then to second again.\n\nOne of the key things to consider when beatmatching is the tempo of both songs, and the musical theory behind the songs. Attempting to beatmatch songs with completely different beats per minute (BPM) will result in one of the songs sounding too fast or too slow.\n\nWhen beatmatching, a popular technique is to vary the equalization of both tracks. For example, when the kicks are occurring on the same beat, a more seamless transition can occur if the lower frequencies are taken out of one of the songs, and the lower frequencies of the other song is boosted. Doing so creates a smoother transition. \n\n===Pitch and tempo===\n\nThe [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of a track are normally linked together: spin a disc 5% faster and both pitch and tempo will be 5% higher.  However, some modern DJ software can change pitch and tempo independently using [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|time-stretching and pitch-shifting]], allowing [[harmonic mixing]]. There is also a feature in most modern DJ software to change the tempo but keeping the original pitch, this is often referred to as [[master tempo]] or [[key adjust]].\n\n==History==\n\nBeatmatching was invented by [[Francis Grasso]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=\"Gear\">{{cite web | url=http://gearpatrol.com/2015/07/10/how-to-beatmatch-dj/ | title=Breaking Down the Art of Beatmatching | publisher=Gear Patrol | date=10 July 2015 | accessdate=2 May 2016 | author=Bowers, Ben}}</ref> Initially he was counting the tempo with a [[metronome]] and looking for records with the same tempo.<ref name=\"Gear\" /> Later a mixer was built for him by [[Alex Rosner]] which let him listen to any channel in the headphones independently of what was playing on the speakers; this became the defining feature of [[DJ mixer]]s.  That and turntables with [[pitch control]] enabled him to mix tracks with different tempo by changing the pitch of the ''cued'' (redirected to headphones) track to match its tempo with the track being played by ear.  Essentially, the technique he originated hasn't changed since.\n\nThese days{{when|date=May 2016}} beat-matching is considered central to DJing, and features making it possible are a requirement for DJ-oriented players.  In 1978, the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200MK2]] turntable was released, whose comfortable and precise sliding pitch control and high torque [[Direct-drive turntable|direct drive]] motor made beat-matching easier and it became the standard among DJs. With the advent of the compact disc, DJ-oriented [[Compact Disc player]]s with pitch control and other features enabling beat-matching (and sometimes [[scratching]]), dubbed [[CDJ]]s, were introduced by various companies.  More recently, software with similar capabilities has been developed to allow manipulation of [[digital audio]] files stored on computers using turntables with special vinyl records (e.g. [[Final Scratch]], [[M-Audio Torq]], [[Serato Scratch Live]]) or computer interface (e.g. [[Traktor DJ Studio]], [[Mixxx]], Virtual DJ). Other software including algorithmic beat-matching is [[Ableton Live]], which allows for realtime music manipulation and deconstruction, or [[Mixmeister]], a DJ Mixset creation tool.  Freeware software such as [[Rapid Evolution]] can detect the [[beats per minute]] and determine the percent BPM difference between songs. \n\nThe change from pure hardware to software is on the rise, and big DJs are introducing new equipment to their kits such as the [[laptop]], and dropping the difficulty of carrying hundreds of CDs with them. The creation of the mp3-player allowed DJs to have an alternative tool for DJIng. Limitations with mp3-player DJing equipment has meant that only second generation equipment such as the IDJ2 or the Cortex Dmix-300 have the pitch control that alters tempo and allows for beat-matching on a digital music player. However, recent additions to the [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] CDJ family, such as the [[CDJ-2000]], allow mp3-player and other digital storage devices (such as external hard drives, SD cards and USB memory sticks) to be connected to the CDJ device via USB. This allows the DJ to make use of the beat-matching capabilities of the CDJ unit whilst playing digital music files from the mp3-player or other storage device.\n\nMost modern DJ hardware and software now offers a \"Sync\" feature which automatically adjusts the tempo between tracks being mixed so the DJ no longer needs to spend time and effort matching beats. This has caused some controversy in the DJ industry since almost anyone can beat-match thanks to the new function.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[DJ mix]]\n* [[Harmonic mixing]]\n* [[Segue]]\n* [[Mashup (music)|Mashup]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DJing}}\n\n[[Category:DJing]]\n[[Category:Disco]]\n[[Category:Audio mixing]]", "sha1": "hzzyj5uvxvkiimlg9nytdv3o3yfl3c9"}}, {"title": "Brighton University", "ns": "0", "id": "4303", "redirect": {"title": "University of Brighton"}, "revision": {"id": "317076053", "parentid": "44112744", "timestamp": "2009-09-30T12:22:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "comment": "not a histmerge candidate", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[University of Brighton]]{{nahmc|Brighton University}}", "sha1": "hy62eoe4ij4tgrwnco2bsnw4p7kby0z"}}, {"title": "Beltane", "ns": "0", "id": "4306", "revision": {"id": "866721080", "parentid": "866720916", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T03:22:24Z", "contributor": {"ip": "49.197.241.170"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the Scottish rock band|The Beltanes}}\n{{redirect|Beltaine}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name  = Beltane\n|type          = default\n|longtype      = Cultural<br/>Pagan ([[Celtic polytheism]], [[Celtic Neopaganism]], [[Wicca]])\n|image         = Beltane Bonfire on Calton Hill.JPG \n|caption       = A Beltane [[bonfire]] on [[Calton Hill]] in Edinburgh\n|nickname      = ''L\u00e1 Bealtaine'' (Irish)<br/>''L\u00e0 Bealltainn'' (Scottish Gaelic)<br/>''Laa Boaltinn/Boaldyn''<ref>Celtic myths and legends by Charles Squire {{ISBN|1-84204-015-4}}</ref> (Manx)<br/>Beltaine; Beltine<ref name=\"Chadwick\">Chadwick, Nora (1970) ''The Celts'' London, Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-021211-6}} p. 181</ref>\n|observedby    = [[Gaels]]<br/>(Modern [[Irish people]], [[Scottish people]], [[Manx people]], [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic neopagans]] and [[Wicca]]ns)\n|significance  = Beginning of summer\n|date          = 1 May<br/><small>(or 1 November for Neopagans in the [[Southern Hemisphere|S.

Most commonly it is held on 1 May, or about halfway between the [[March equinox|spring equinox]] and the [[summer solstice]]. Historically, it was widely observed throughout [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. In [[Irish language|Irish]] the name for the festival day is ''L\u00e1 Bealtaine'' ({{IPA-ga|l\u032a\u02e0a\u02d0 \u02c8b\u02b2al\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u02e0\u0259n\u02b2\u0259|}}), in [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''L\u00e0 Bealltainn'' ({{IPA-gd|l\u032a\u02e0a\u02d0 \u02c8pjaul\u032a\u02e0t\u032a\u026a\u0272|}}) and in [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]] ''Laa Boaltinn''/''Boaldyn''. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals\u2014along with [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]] and [[Lughnasadh]]\u2014and is similar to the Welsh [[Calan Mai]].\n\nBeltane is mentioned in some of the [[Early Irish literature|earliest Irish literature]], and it is associated with important events in [[Irish mythology]]. It marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect the cattle, crops and people, and to encourage growth. Special [[bonfire]]s were kindled, and their flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around the bonfire or between two bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the ''[[aos s\u00ed]]''. Doors, windows, byres and the cattle themselves would be decorated with yellow May flowers, perhaps because they evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: a thorn bush decorated with flowers, ribbons and bright shells. [[Holy well]]s were also visited, while Beltane [[dew]] was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in other parts of Great Britain and Europe.\n\nBeltane celebrations had largely died out by the mid-20th century, although some of its customs continued and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. Since the late 20th century, [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic neopagans]] and [[Wicca]]ns have observed Beltane, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. Neopagans in the Southern Hemisphere often celebrate Beltane at the other end of the year (around 1 November).\n\n==Historic Beltane customs==\nBeltane was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: [[Samhain]] (~1 November), [[Imbolc]] (~1 February), Beltane (~1 May), and [[Lughnasadh]] (~1 August). Beltane marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season, when livestock were driven out to the summer pastures.<ref name=hutton>Hutton, Ronald. ''The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain''. Oxford University Press, 1996. pp.&nbsp;218\u2013225</ref><ref name=koch>Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. 2006. p.&nbsp;202</ref> Rituals were held at that time to protect them from harm, both natural and supernatural, and this mainly involved the \"symbolic use of fire\".<ref name=hutton/> There were also rituals to protect crops, dairy products and people, and to encourage growth. The ''[[aos s\u00ed]]'' (often referred to as spirits or fairies) were thought to be especially active at Beltane (as at Samhain)<ref name=hutton/> and the goal of many Beltane rituals was to appease them. Most scholars see the ''aos s\u00ed'' as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits.<ref>Santino, Jack. ''The Hallowed Eve: Dimensions of Culture in a Calendar Festival of Northern Ireland''. University Press of Kentucky, 1998. p.&nbsp;105</ref> Beltane was a \"spring time festival of optimism\" during which \"fertility ritual again was important, perhaps connecting with the waxing power of the sun\".<ref name=\"Chadwick\"/>\n\n===Before the modern era===\nBeltane (the beginning of summer) and Samhain (the beginning of winter) are thought to have been the most important of the four Gaelic festivals. Sir [[James George Frazer]] wrote in ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]'' that the times of Beltane and Samhain are of little importance to European crop-growers, but of great importance to herdsmen. Thus, he suggests that halving the year at 1 May and 1 November dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent on their herds.<ref>[[James George Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]''. Forgotten Books, 2008. p.&nbsp;644</ref>\n\nThe earliest mention of Beltane is in [[Old Irish literature]] from [[Gaelic Ireland]]. According to the early medieval texts ''[[Sanas Cormaic]]'' and ''[[Tochmarc Emire]]'', Beltane was held on 1 May and marked the beginning of summer. The texts say that, to protect cattle from disease, the [[druid]]s would make two fires \"with great incantations\" and drive the cattle between them.<ref>Stokes, Whitley (ed.) and John O'Donovan (tr.).

CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts.</ref>\n\nAccording to 17th-century historian [[Geoffrey Keating]], there was a great gathering at the hill of [[Uisneach]] each Beltane in medieval Ireland, where a sacrifice was made to a god named Beil. Keating wrote that two bonfires would be lit in every district of Ireland, and cattle would be driven between them to protect them from disease.<ref>Keating, Geoffrey.

Ronald Hutton writes that this may \"preserve a tradition of Beltane ceremonies there\", but adds \"Keating or his source may simply have conflated this legend with the information in ''Sanas Chormaic'' to produce a piece of pseudo-history.\"<ref name=hutton/> Nevertheless, excavations at Uisneach in the 20th century found evidence of large fires and charred bones, showing it to have been ritually significant.<ref name=hutton/><ref name=patterson2>Patterson, Nerys.

All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill.<ref name=\"Chadwick\"/><ref name=\"Danaher\">Danaher, Kevin (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin, Mercier. {{ISBN|1-85635-093-2}} pp. 86\u2013127</ref> [[Ronald Hutton]] writes that \"To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood.\"<ref name=hutton/> In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a [[need-fire]] or [[force-fire]] at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred.<ref name=hutton/> In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires\u2014as described in ''Sanas Cormaic'' almost 1000 years before\u2014was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland.<ref name=hutton/> Sometimes the cattle would be driven \"around\" a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers.

''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/frazer/index.htm Chapter 62: The Fire-Festivals of Europe].</ref> According to Frazer, the fire rituals are a kind of [[sympathetic magic|imitative or sympathetic magic]]. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to \"ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants\". According to another, they were meant to symbolically \"burn up and destroy all harmful influences\".<ref>Frazer, James George (1922). ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]''.

[[Alexander Carmichael]] wrote that there was a feast featuring lamb, and that formerly this lamb was sacrificed.<ref>Carmichael, ''[[Carmina Gadelica]] Volume 1'', p.&nbsp;191</ref> In 1769, [[Thomas Pennant]] wrote that, in [[Perthshire]], a [[caudle]] made from eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk was cooked on the bonfire. Some of the mixture was poured on the ground as a [[libation]]. Everyone present would then take an oatmeal cake, called the ''bannoch Bealltainn'' or \"Beltane [[Bannock (food)|bannock]]\". A bit of it was offered to the spirits to protect their livestock (one bit to protect the horses, one bit to protect the sheep, and so forth) and a bit was offered to each of the animals that might harm their livestock (one to the fox, one to the eagle, and so forth). Afterwards, they would drink the caudle.<ref name=hutton/>\n\nAccording to 18th century writers, in parts of Scotland there was another ritual involving the oatmeal cake. The cake would be cut and one of the slices marked with charcoal. The slices would then be put in a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] and everyone would take one out while blindfolded. According to one writer, whoever got the marked piece would have to leap through the fire three times. According to another, those present would pretend to throw him into the fire and, for some time afterwards, they would speak of him as if he were dead. This \"may embody a memory of actual human sacrifice\", or it may have always been symbolic.<ref name=hutton/> A similar ritual (i.e. of pretending to burn someone in the fire) was practised at spring and summer bonfire festivals in other parts of Europe.<ref>Frazer, James George (1922).

Sometimes loose flowers were strewn at the doors and windows and sometimes they were made into [[flower bouquet|bouquets]], [[garland]]s or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire.<ref name=hutton/> Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.\n\nThe May Bush was popular in parts of Ireland until the late 19th century. This was a small tree or branch\u2014typically hawthorn, rowan or sycamore\u2014decorated with bright flowers, ribbons, painted shells, and so forth. There were household May Bushes (which would be placed outside each house) and communal May Bushes (which would be set in a public spot or paraded around the neighbourhood). In [[Dublin]] and [[Belfast]], May Bushes were brought into town from the countryside and decorated by the whole neighbourhood.<ref name=\"Danaher\"/> Each neighbourhood vied for the most handsome tree and, sometimes, residents of one would try to steal the May Bush of another. This led to the May Bush being outlawed in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]].<ref name=\"Danaher\"/> In some places, it was customary to dance around the May Bush, and at the end of the festivities it may be burnt in the bonfire.<ref name=clark>Clark, Katharine. ''An Irish Book of Shadows''. Galde Press, 2001. p.&nbsp;172</ref> Some, however, were left in place for a month. Thorn trees were seen as special trees and were associated with the ''aos s\u00ed''. The custom of decorating a May Bush or [[Maypole|May Tree]] was found in many parts of Europe. Frazer believes that such customs are a relic of [[tree worship]] and writes: \"The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and to each house, the blessings which the [[List of tree deities|tree-spirit]] has in its power to bestow.\"<ref>Frazer, James George (1922).

[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/frazer/gb01000.htm Chapter 10: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe].</ref> [[Emyr Estyn Evans]] suggests that the May Bush custom may have come to Ireland from England, because it seemed to be found in areas with strong English influence and because the Irish saw it as unlucky to damage certain thorn trees.<ref name=folkways>[[Emyr Estyn Evans|Evans, Emyr Estyn]]. ''Irish Folk Ways''. Routledge, 1957. pp.&nbsp;272\u2013274</ref> However, \"lucky\" and \"unlucky\" trees varied by region, and it has been suggested that Beltane was the only time when cutting thorn trees was allowed.<ref name=watts>Watts, D C. ''Dictionary of Plant Lore''. Academic Press, 2007. p.&nbsp;246</ref> The practice of bedecking a May Bush with flowers, ribbons, garlands and bright shells is found among the Gaelic diaspora, most notably in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and in some Easter traditions on the [[East Coast of the United States]].<ref name=\"Danaher\"/>\n\n====Other customs====\n[[Holy well]]s were often visited at Beltane, and at the other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking [[sunwise]] (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or [[clootie]]s (see [[clootie well]]).<ref name=\"Danaher\"/> The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning [[dew]]. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in the sunlight, and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.<ref name=koch/><ref name=\"Danaher\"/><ref name=clark/>\n\nPeople also took steps specifically to ward-off or appease the ''[[aos s\u00ed]]''. Food was left or milk poured at the doorstep or places associated with the ''aos s\u00ed'', such as 'fairy trees', as an offering.<ref name=\"Evans, p. 272\">Evans, ''Irish Folk Ways'', p.&nbsp;272</ref><ref>Danaher, ''The Year in Ireland'', p.&nbsp;121</ref> In Ireland, cattle would be brought to '[[fairy fort]]s', where a small amount of their blood would be collected. The owners would then pour it into the earth with prayers for the herd's safety. Sometimes the blood would be left to dry and then be burnt.<ref name=\"Evans, p. 272\"/> It was thought that dairy products were especially at risk from harmful spirits.<ref name=\"Danaher\"/><ref name=\"McNeill2\">McNeill (1959) Vol. 2. p.&nbsp;63</ref><ref name=\"Campbell\">[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900, 1902, 2005) ''The Gaelic Otherworld''.

They would \"carry with them seeds of grain, implements of husbandry, the first well water, and the herb vervain (or rowan as a substitute). The procession generally stopped at the four cardinal points of the compass, beginning in the east, and rituals were performed in each of the four directions\".<ref>Danaher, ''The Year in Ireland'', pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\nThe festival persisted widely up until the 1950s, and in some places the celebration of Beltane continues today.<ref name=mackillop/><ref name=\"McNeill2\"/><ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n==Revival==\n\nAs a festival, Beltane had largely died out by the mid-20th century, although some of its customs continued and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event. In Ireland, Beltane fires were common until the mid 20th century,<ref name=\"Danaher\"/> but the custom seems to have lasted to the present day only in [[County Limerick]] (especially in [[Limerick]] itself) and in [[Arklow]], [[County Wicklow]].<ref>[http://www.wicklowpeople.ie/news/council-faces-cleanup-bill-after-maybush-fires-1021379.html Council faces clean-up after maybush fires.] Wicklow People, 5 May 2005.</ref> However, the custom has been revived in some parts of the country. Some cultural groups have sought to revive the custom at [[Uisneach]] and perhaps at the [[Hill of Tara]].<ref>Aideen O'Leary reports (\"An Irish Apocryphal Apostle: Muirch\u00fa's Portrayal of Saint Patrick\" ''The Harvard Theological Review'' '''89'''.3 [July 1996:287\u2013301] p. 289) that, for didactic and dramatic purposes, the festival of Beltane, as presided over by Patrick's opponent King [[L\u00f3egaire mac N\u00e9ill]], was moved to the eve of Easter and from Uisneach to Tara by [[Muirchu moccu Machtheni|Muirch\u00fa]] (late 7th century) in his ''Vita sancti Patricii''; he describes the festival as ''in Temora, istorium Babylone'' (\"at Tara, their Babylon\"). However there is no authentic connection of Tara with Babylon, nor any known connection of Tara with Beltane.</ref> The lighting of a community Beltane fire from which each hearth fire is then relit is observed today in some parts of the [[Gaelic diaspora]], though in most of these cases it is a cultural revival rather than an unbroken survival of the ancient tradition.<ref name=\"Danaher\"/><ref name=\"Dames\">Dames, Michael (1992) ''Mythic Ireland''.

If they are unable to make a bonfire or attend a bonfire ceremony, torches or candles may be used instead.

Unlike Celtic Reconstructionism, Wicca is syncretic and melds practices from many different cultures. In general, the Wiccan Beltane is more akin to the Germanic/English May Day festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as [[maypole]] dancing). Some Wiccans enact a ritual union of the [[Horned God|May Lord]] and [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|May Lady]].<ref name=\"SpiralDance\">[[Starhawk]] (1979, 1989) ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]''.

In [[Scottish Gaelic]], the month is called ''(An) C\u00e8itean'' or ''a' Mh\u00e0igh'', and the festival is ''Latha Bealltainn''. Sometimes the older Scottish Gaelic spelling ''Bealltuinn'' is used. The word ''C\u00e9itean'' comes from ''C\u00e9ad [[Shamhain]]'', an old alternative name for the festival.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn modern Scottish Gaelic, ''Latha Buidhe Bealltainn'' or ''L\u00e0 Buidhe Bealltainn'' (\"the yellow day of Beltane\") is used to describe the first day of May. This term ''L\u00e1 Buidhe Bealtaine'' is also used in Irish and is translated as \"Bright May Day\". In Ireland it is referred to in a common folk tale as ''Luan Lae Bealtaine''; the first day of the week (Monday/''Luan'') is added to emphasise the first day of summer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u00d3 Crualaoich|first=Gear\u00f3id|date=1 January 1994|title=Non-Sovereignty Queen Aspects of the Otherworld Female in Irish Hag Legends: The Case of Cailleach Bh\u00e9arra|jstor=20522445|journal=B\u00e9aloideas|volume=62/63|pages=147\u2013162|doi=10.2307/20522445}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nSince the early 20th century it has been commonly accepted that [[Old Irish]] ''Beltaine'' is derived from a [[Common Celtic]] ''*belo-te(p)ni\u00e2'', meaning \"bright fire\". The element ''*belo-'' might be cognate with the English word ''bale'' (as in bale-fire) meaning \"white\" or \"shining\"; compare [[Old English]] ''bael'', and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]/[[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''baltas/balts'', found in the name of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; in [[Slavic languages]] ''byelo'' or ''beloye'' also means \"white\", as in ''\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c'' (White Russia or [[Belarus]]) or ''\u0411\u0435\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0435'' ([[White Sea]]). A more recent etymology by Xavier Delamarre would derive it from a Common Celtic ''*Beltinij\u0101'', cognate with the name of the Lithuanian goddess of death ''[[Giltin\u0117]]'', the root of both being [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*g\u02b7elH-'' (\"suffering, death\").<ref>Delamarre, Xavier. Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Editions Errance, Paris, 2003, p. 70</ref>\n\nIn \u00d3 Duinn\u00edn's Irish dictionary (1904), Beltane is referred to as ''C\u00e9adamh(ain)'' which it explains is short for ''C\u00e9ad-shamh(ain)'' meaning \"first (of) summer\". The dictionary also states that ''Dia C\u00e9adamhan'' is May Day and ''M\u00ed C\u00e9adamhan'' is the month of May.\n\n===Toponymy===\n[[File:Beltany stone circle.jpg|thumb|[[Beltany stone circle]] in Ireland]]\nThere are a number of [[place names in Ireland]] containing the word ''Bealtaine'', indicating places where Bealtaine festivities were once held.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their [[Episcopal see|sees]] and replaced with [[Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.<ref name=\"BMH\"/>\n\nIn 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.<ref name=\"BMH\"/> [[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Ni\u00e8vre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy]], France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223.

Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity.

last-born of [[Jacob]]'s thirteen children (12 sons and 1 daughter), and the second and last son of [[Rachel]] in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition. He was the progenitor of the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Tribe of Benjamin]]. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] unlike Rachel's first son, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], Benjamin was born in [[Canaan]].\n\nIn the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], Benjamin's name appears as \"Binyaamem\" ({{Hebrew name 1 | \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd | \"Son of my days\"}}). In the [[Quran]], Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child, who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being [[Chileab]], [[Jesse]] and [[Amram]].\n\n==Name==\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Benjamin's name arose when Jacob deliberately changed the name \"Benoni\", the original name of Benjamin, since Benoni was an allusion to Rachel's dying just after she had given birth, as it means \"son of my pain\".<ref>Genesis 35:18</ref> Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the [[Jahwist]] and the other being the [[Elohist]].<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref>\n\nUnusually for one of the [[12 tribes of Israel]], the Bible does not explain the  [[etymology]] of Benjamin's name. Medieval commentator [[Rashi]] gives two different explanations, based on [[Midrash]]ic sources. \"Son of the south\", with south derived from the word for the right hand side, referring to the birth of Benjamin in [[Canaan]], as compared with the birth of all the other sons of Jacob in [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]].<ref name=\"Rashi\">https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8230/jewish/Chapter-35.htm#showrashi=true</ref><ref name = \"bdmtze\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  Modern scholars have proposed that \"son of the south\" / \"right\" is a reference to the tribe being subordinate to the more dominant tribe of Ephraim.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/> Alternatively, Rashi suggests it means \"son of days\", meaning a son born in Jacob's old age. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] consistently spells his name \"\u05d1\u05df \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd\", with a terminal [[mem]], (\"Binyamim\"), which could be translated literally as \"spirit man\" but is in line with the interpretation that the name was a reference to the advanced age of Jacob when Benjamin was born.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n\nAccording to classical rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after [[Rachel]] had [[fasted]] for a long time, as a religious devotion with the hope of a new child as a reward. By then [[Jacob]] had become over 100 years old.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/> Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative,<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/> but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons.<ref name = \"xhbyqx\">{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:21|HE}}</ref> Textual scholars believe that this is the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the [[Jahwist]] and [[Elohist]] narratives, which make up most of the [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n\n==Israelites in Egypt==\n[[Image:BenjaminandJoseph.jpg|thumb|left|Benjamin (right) embracing his brother [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]].]]\n\nThe Torah's Joseph narrative, at a stage when Joseph is unrecognised by his brothers, describes Joseph as testing whether his brothers have reformed by secretly planting a silver cup in Benjamin's bag. Then, publicly searching the bags for it, and after ''finding'' it in Benjamin's possession, demanding that Benjamin become his [[slave]] as a punishment.<ref name=Gen44>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}}</ref>\n\nThe narrative goes on to state that when [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob's heart. This caused Joseph to recant and reveal his identity.<ref name=Gen44/> The [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|midrashic book of Jasher]] argues that prior to revealing his identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via [[astrology]], using an [[astrolabe]]-like tool.<ref name = \"bdmtze\">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> It continues by stating that Benjamin [[divination|divined]] that the ''man on the throne'' was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n[[File:Morgan-bible-fl06.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of Benjamin being returned to Egypt (Genesis 44).]]\nSome classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/> In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on the memory of Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important to him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/> These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n\nIn the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them;<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|43|HE}}</ref> the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:30|HE}}</ref> and he gives Benjamin five times as much food as he apportions to the others.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:34|HE}}</ref> According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n\n==Origin==\n[[Image:Kever Binyamin.jpg|thumb|300px|An exterior view of a [[Mamluk]] [[caravanserai]] complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, traditionally believed to be the tomb of Benjamin, located outside [[Kfar Saba]], Israel.]]\n\nBiblical scholars believe, due to their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that Ephraim and Manasseh were originally considered one tribe, that of ''Joseph''.<ref name = \"gzuhsh\">''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Ephraim''</ref> According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.<ref name = \"gzuhsh\"/><ref name = \"fxeide\">''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref>\n\nThe description of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars to refer to the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan.<ref name = \"fxeide\"/> A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the ''Joseph tribes'' (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to [[Egypt]] [[the Exodus|and returned]], while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in [[Canaan]] throughout.<ref name = \"fxeide\"/><ref>[[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Bible Unearthed''</ref>\n\nAccording to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] to obtain a wife originated as a [[metaphor]] for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt.<ref name = \"fxeide\"/> According to textual scholars, the [[Jahwist]] version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal [[matriarch]]s whatsoever.<ref name = \"fxeide\"/><ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote the Bible?''</ref>\n\n==Benjamin's sons==\nAccording to {{bibleverse||Genesis|46:21|HE}}, Benjamin had ten sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. The name of his wife/wives are not given. Classical rabbinical tradition adds that each son's name honors Joseph:<ref name = \"bdmtze\"/>\n*''Belah'' (meaning ''swallow''), in reference to Joseph disappearing (''being swallowed up'')\n*''Becher'' (meaning ''first born''), in reference to Joseph being the first child of Rachel\n*''Ashbel'' (meaning ''capture''), in reference to Joseph having suffered captivity\n*''Gera'' (meaning ''grain''), in reference to Joseph living in a ''foreign'' land (Egypt)\n*''Naaman'' (meaning ''grace''), in reference to Joseph having graceful speech\n*''Ehi'' (meaning ''my brother''), in reference to Joseph being Benjamin's only full-brother (as opposed to half-brothers)\n*''[[Rosh (biblical figure)|Rosh]]'' (meaning ''elder''), in reference to Joseph being older than Benjamin\n*''Muppim'' (meaning ''double mouth''), in reference to Joseph passing on what he had been taught by Jacob\n*''Huppim'' (meaning ''[[chuppah|marriage canopies]]''), in reference to Joseph being married in Egypt, while Benjamin was not there\n*''Ard'' (meaning ''wanderer''/''fugitive''), in reference to Joseph being like a rose\n\n==In Islam==\nThough not named in the [[Quran]],<ref name=\"Cite quran|12|4|e=102|s=ns\">{{cite quran|12|4|e=102|s=ns}}</ref> Benjamin is referred to as the righteous youngest son of [[Jacob]], in the narrative of [[Joseph in Islam]]ic tradition. Apart from that, however, Islamic tradition does not provide much detail regarding Benjamin's life, and refers to him as being born from Jacob's wife [[Rachel]]. As with Jewish tradition, it also further links a connection between the names of Benjamin's children and Joseph.<ref name=\"EOIBinyamin\">{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Vajda, G. |author2=Wensick, A.

Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of [[heavy metal music]].<ref name=\"Larson2004a\"/> The band helped define the genre with releases such as ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' (1970), ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970) and ''[[Master of Reality]]'' (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.\n\nFormed in 1968 as the Polka Tulk Blues Band, a blues rock band, the group went through line up changes, renamed themselves as Earth, broke up and reformed. By 1969, they had named themselves Black Sabbath after the film ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'' starring [[Boris Karloff]], and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in [[Workington]]. Signing to [[Philips Records]] in November 1969, they released their first single, \"[[Evil Woman (Crow song)|Evil Woman]]\" in January 1970. Their debut album, ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'', was released on [[Friday the 13th]], February 1970, on Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, [[Vertigo Records]]. Though receiving a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success and reached number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], so the band returned to the studios to quickly record the follow up, ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', which was also released in 1970. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'', critics were starting to respond favourably.\n\nOsbourne's regular use of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists [[Ian Gillan]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ray Gillen]] and [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]], as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1991, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer [[Vinny Appice]] to record ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' (1992). The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]]''. Black Sabbath's final studio album and nineteenth overall, ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]'' (2013), features all of the original members but Ward, who left the band prior to the recording sessions due to a contract dispute.

During the recording of ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'', Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> Recording of ''Technical Ecstasy'' was difficult; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and (for the first time) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\".<ref name=\"TE AMG Review\">{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/technical-ecstasy-mw0000197070|title=Technical Ecstasy \u2013 Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. ''Technical Ecstasy'' failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S., and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997.<ref name=\"riaa\"/> The album included \"[[Dirty Women]]\", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song \"It's Alright\".<ref name=\"TE AMG Review\" /> Touring in support of ''Technical Ecstasy'' began in November 1976, with openers [[Boston (band)|Boston]] and [[Ted Nugent]] in the U.S., and completed in Europe with [[AC/DC]] in April 1977.<ref name=\"MusicMight\"/>\n\nIn late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist [[Dave Walker]], a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Savoy Brown]], and informed him that Osbourne had left the band.<ref name=\"walker_interview\">{{cite web |last=Saulnier |first=Jason |date=30 December 2011 |title=Dave Walker Interview \u2013 Black Sabbath Singer talks Never Say Die |url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/ |publisher=musiclegends.ca |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref> Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath.<ref name=\"walker_interview\" /><ref name=\"AMG Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-sabbath-mn0000771438|title=Black Sabbath \u2013 Biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song \"Junior's Eyes\" on the BBC Television programme \"Look! Hear!\"<ref name=\"walker_interview\" /> Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath.<ref name=\"walker_interview\" /> \"The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me\", Osbourne said. \"I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93\u201394}} Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the \"Look! Hear!\" footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.<ref name=\"walker_interview\" />\n\nOsbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. \"Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band\", Iommi explained. \"He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nThe band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, writing and recording what would become ''[[Never Say Die!]]''. \"It took quite a long time\", Iommi said. \"We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|pp=93\u201394}} The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the United Kingdom, and number 69 in the U.S. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's \"unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse.\"<ref name=\"NSD AMG Review\">{{cite web|last=Eduardo|first=Rivadavia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/never-say-die%21-mw0000198810|title=Never Say Die \u2013 Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> The album featured the singles \"[[Never Say Die (Black Sabbath song)|Never Say Die]]\" and \"[[Hard Road (Black Sabbath song)|Hard Road]]\", both of which cracked the top 40 in the United Kingdom. The band also made their second appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing \"Never Say Die\". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the U.S.<ref name=\"riaa\"/>\n\nTouring in support of ''Never Say Die!'' began in May 1978 with openers [[Van Halen]]. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance \"tired and uninspired\", a stark contrast to the \"youthful\" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.<ref name=\"MusicMight\"/> The band filmed a performance at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ''Never Say Die''. The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on 11 December.\n\nFollowing the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne \"was on a totally different level altogether\".<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> \"At that time, Ozzy had come to an end\", Iommi said. \"We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=95}} Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979.<ref name=\"osbourneautobiography\" /> \"I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid\", Ward said. \"Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=97}}\n\n=== ''Heaven and Hell'' and ''Mob Rules'' (1979\u20131982) ===\nSharon Arden (later [[Sharon Osbourne]]), daughter of Black Sabbath manager [[Don Arden]], suggested former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable.<ref name=\"iommiautobiography\" /> Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. \"They were totally different altogether\", Iommi explains. \"Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing ''across'' the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in \"Iron Man\". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.\"{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=98}}\n\nGeezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons. According to Dio, the band initially hired [[Craig Gruber]] (with whom Dio had previously played while in [[Elf (band)|Elf]]) on bass to assist with writing the new album.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Gruber was soon replaced by [[Geoff Nicholls]] of [[Quartz (metal band)|Quartz]]. The new line-up returned to [[Criteria Studios]] in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by [[Martin Birch]], ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release AllMusic said the album was \"one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/heaven-and-hell-mw0000649895|title=Heaven and Hell \u2013 Review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> ''Heaven and Hell'' peaked at number 9 in the United Kingdom, and number 28 in the U.S., the band's highest charting album since ''Sabotage''. The album eventually sold a million copies in the U.S.,<ref name=\"riaa\"/> and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.\n\n[[File:Black Sabbath Cardiff 1981.jpg|thumb|left|Black Sabbath performing in [[Cardiff]] in 1981]]\n\nBlack Sabbath toured the U.S. throughout 1980 with [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]] on the \"Black and Blue\" tour, with a show at [[Nassau Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as ''[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |date=5 January 1981 |title=Brief Reviews: New Films |journal=New York Magazine |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=72 |issn=0028-7369}}</ref> On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] with [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Molly Hatchet]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=9 August 1980 |title=Stadiums & Festivals |journal=Billboard |volume=92 |issue=32 |page=34 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref>https://www.black-sabbath.com/tourdates/hh_tour/ 1980-1981 Heaven & Hell Tour setlist</ref> The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 [[Day on the Green]] at [[Oakland Coliseum]]. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of \"Paranoid\" as a single, which reached the top 20.<ref name=\"billboard_200\"/>\n\nOn 18 August 1980, after a show in [[Minneapolis]], Ward quit the band. \"It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated\". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where \"He might as well be a Martian\". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave.

Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|an earlier team named the Bills]], originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).\n\nIn 1947 a contest was held to rename the Bisons, which was owned by James Breuil of the [[Frontier Oil Company]]. The winning entry suggested Bills, reflecting on the famous western frontiersman, [[Buffalo Bill Cody]]. Carrying the \"frontier\" theme further, the winning contestant offered the team was being supported by Frontier Oil and was \"opening a new frontier in sports in Western New York.\" When Buffalo joined the new American Football League in 1960, the name of the city's earlier pro football entry was adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/nicknames.aspx#sthash.fZkeALva.dpuf|title=Franchise nicknames - Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the [[United States Football League]] and a series of high draft picks allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]]; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, records in both categories that still stand.\n\nThe rise of the division rival [[New England Patriots]] under [[Tom Brady]], along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time. It was broken when the Bills secured a wild-card berth on December 31, 2017.

A new logo, a stylized \"B\" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo.

Though the Bills and [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] both originated in the [[American Football League]], the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent. Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of [[Jim Kelly]] as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the Belichick/Brady-led Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival,<ref name = \"2017primaryrivalpoll\"/> and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win-loss records. Miami leads the overall series 60-47-1 as of 2017, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\n\nThe rivalry with the [[New England Patriots]] first started when both teams were original franchises in the [[American Football League]] prior to the NFL-AFL merger. After the rise of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and quarterback [[Tom Brady]] in New England, the Patriots have dominated the AFC East, including the Bills. The Bills-Patriots rivalry in particular has become lopsided as the Patriots are 29-5 against the Bills since Belichick became head coach.

The series started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between [[New York City]] and [[Upstate New York]], it is not as intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases either have begrudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments and briefly heated up when former Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]] became head coach of the Bills for two seasons.

The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice [[James Williams (defensive back)|James (J.D.) Williams]] wore it for his first two seasons; it has since been returned to general circulation, with practice squad safety [[Dean Marlowe]] wearing the number in 2018.\n\nNumber 15 was historically only issued sparingly after the retirement of [[Jack Kemp]],<ref name=\"reduced\" /> but was later returned to general circulation. It is not being used as of the 2018 regular season.\n\nNumber 1 has also only rarely been used, for reasons never explained. Kicker [[Mike Hollis]], who played one season for the Bills in 2002, was the most recent to wear the number.\n\n===Ralph C.

As early as 1930 the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north-south through the [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] district in order to draw traffic off the city streets.<ref>Daily Boston Globe, December 21, 1930 'Streets In The Air Only Solution To Boston's Traffic Problems So Says the Planning Board That Asks for Two-Level Road Across City, Costing $28,000,000, as First Item in a Big Scheme'</ref> Commissioner of Public Works [[William F. Callahan|William Callahan]] promoted plans for an elevated expressway which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery putting it underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, \"like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).\"<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |df= }}</ref>\nIn 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day.

The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]\nAnother important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed  [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.)  The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.\n\nBuilding demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|MA-128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.\n\nWith ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]]. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.\n\nThe original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]]. It was never built.\n\n===Mixing of traffic===\nA major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north\u2013south traffic, but much east\u2013west traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston, and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston\u2014the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]\u2014mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.\n\n===Mass transit===\nA number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.\n\n{{As of|2015}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed.

Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Haglund2003\">{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=316}}</ref>\n\n==Early planning==\nThe project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together\u2014thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nPlanning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''.

Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, \"Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks\"</ref>\n\n==Obstacles==\nIn addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.\nThe downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|landfill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]  [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.\n\nThe project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing.

Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.\n\nThe multi-lane interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOther challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.\n\n==Construction phase==\n[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the \"Big Dig\"]]\n\nThe project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project\u2014too large for any company to undertake alone\u2014the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J. F. White Contracting Co.|J. F. White]], and the Slattery division of [[Skanska]] USA. (Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.)\n\nThe nature of the [[Charles River]] crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as \"Scheme Z\". This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as {{convert|100|ft|m}} immediately adjacent to the Charles River.<ref name=\"bg-scheme z\">{{Cite news|title=Caution: High bridge ahead; Artery plan includes an awful scheme for a great wall across the Charles |last=Campbell |first=Robert |date=June 24, 1990 |work= Boston Globe |id= Accessed 2009-08-04 |quote= The grotesque monstrosity that will be the new Central Artery requires a certain power of imagination to be grasped.

The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news | first=Pete | last=Sigmund | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2007-12-10 | df= }}</ref> having since been surpassed by the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]], although that structure is actually a self-anchored suspension bridge, not a cable-stayed bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the \"City Square Tunnel\" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->\n\nBoston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].\n\nThe [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P.

Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.\n\n===Engineering methods and details===\n[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]\nSeveral unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.<ref name=\"AP 122507\">{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035119/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archivedate=2007-12-28 |title=Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Final phases==\n[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]\n\nOn January 18, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Boston [[Logan International Airport]]. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.\n\nThe next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath [[Leverett Circle]] connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished [[Dewey Square Tunnel]].\n\nBy the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.\n\nThe final ramp downtown \u2014 exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]] \u2014 opened January 13, 2006.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Casey | last=Ross | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+14%2C+2006&author=CASEY+ROSS&pub=Boston+Herald&edition=&startpage=009&desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].\n\nExtensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->\n\n==Impact on traffic==\n[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]\nThe Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north\u2013south I-93, several new east\u2013west lanes became available. East\u2013west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.\n\nThe result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994\u20131995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004\u20132005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}</ref>  The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004\u20132005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>  Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.

The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]]. It has been reported that \"hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly\" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing \"hot spots\" where water leakage is especially serious.<ref name=\"CorrosionGraphic\"/> Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded [[rebar]] and other [[structural steel]] reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/>\n\nThe much larger than expected volume of water that must be continuously pumped consumes a correspondingly larger amount of electrical power, and will cause the pumps to wear out much sooner than originally estimated.\n\n===Substandard materials===\n{{update|section|date=December 2012|what happened after the arrests and charges}}\n[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005.

Bible]], the two '''Books of Chronicles''' (commonly referred to as '''1 Chronicles''' and '''2 Chronicles''', or '''First Chronicles''' and '''Second Chronicles''') generally follow the two [[Books of Kings]] and precede [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]], thus concluding the history-oriented books of the [[Old Testament]],{{sfn|Japhet|1993|p=1-2}} often referred to as the [[Deuteronomistic history]].\n\nIn the [[Hebrew Bible]], Chronicles is a single book, called ''Di\u1e07r\u00ea Hayy\u0101m\u00eem'' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9\u05be\u05d4\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd}}, \"The Matters [of] the Days\"), and is the final book of ''[[Ketuvim]]'', the third and last part of the ''[[Tanakh]]''. Chronicles was divided into two books in the [[Septuagint]] and called ''I and II Paralipom\u00e9n\u014dn'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd}}, \"things left on one side\").{{sfn|Japhet|1993|p=1}} The English name comes from the Latin name ''chronikon'', which was given to the text by scholar [[Jerome]] in the 5th century.\n\nChronicles present the biblical narrative from the first human being, [[Adam]], through the [[history of ancient Judah and Israel]] until [[Cyrus's edict|the proclamation]] of King [[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 540 BC).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe Chronicles narrative begins with [[Adam]] and the story is then carried forward, almost entirely by [[Genealogy|genealogical lists]], down to the founding of the first [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (1 Chronicles 1\u20139). The bulk of the remainder of 1 Chronicles, after a brief account of [[Saul]], is concerned with the reign of [[David]] (1 Chronicles 11\u201329). The next long section concerns David's son [[Solomon]] (2 Chronicles 1\u20139), and the final part is concerned with the [[Kingdom of Judah]] with occasional references to the second [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] (2 Chronicles 10\u201336). In the last chapter Judah is destroyed and the people taken into [[Babylonian captivity|exile in Babylon]], and in the final verses the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king [[Cyrus the Great]] conquers the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], and authorises the restoration of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and the return of the exiles.{{sfn|Coggins|2003|p=282}}\n\n== Structure ==\nOriginally a single work, Chronicles was divided into two in the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation produced in the [[3rd century BC|3rd]] and [[2nd century BC|2nd]] centuries Before Christ.{{sfn|Japhet|1993|p=2}} It has three broad divisions: (1) the genealogies in chapters 1\u20139 of 1 Chronicles; (2) the reigns of David and Solomon, taking up the remainder of 1 Chronicles and chapters 1\u20139 of 2 Chronicles; and (3) the story of the divided kingdom, the remainder of 2 Chronicles.\n\nWithin this broad structure there are signs that the author has used various other devices to structure his work, notably the drawing of parallels between David and Solomon (the first becomes king, establishes the worship of Israel's God in Jerusalem, and fights the wars that will enable the Temple to be built, then Solomon becomes king, builds and dedicates the Temple, and reaps the benefits of prosperity and peace).{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=}}\n\n== Composition ==\n===Origins===\nThe last events in Chronicles take place in the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]], the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539&nbsp;BC; this sets an earliest possible date for the book. It was probably composed between 400\u2013250 BC, with the period 350\u2013300 BC the most likely.{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=}} The latest person mentioned in Chronicles is Anani, an eighth-generation descendant of King [[Jehoiachin]] according to the [[Masoretic Text]].  Anani's birth would likely have been sometime between 425 and 400 BC.<ref name=\"Spirit\">New Spirit-Filled Life Bible, Thomas Nelson, 2002, p. 519</ref> The [[Septuagint]] gives an additional five generations in the genealogy of Anani. For those scholars who side with the Septuagint's reading, Anani's likely date of birth is a century later.<ref name=\"Kalimi2005\">{{cite book|author=Isaac Kalimi|title=An Ancient Israelite Historian: Studies in the Chronicler, His Time, Place and Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmk5CDRsbwMC&pg=PA62|date=January 2005|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|isbn=978-90-232-4071-6|pages=61\u201364}}</ref>\n\nChronicles appears to be largely the work of a single individual, with some later additions and editing. The writer  was probably male, probably a [[Levite]] (temple priest), and probably from Jerusalem. He was well read, a skilled editor, and a sophisticated theologian. His intention was to use Israel's past to convey religious messages to his peers, the literary and political elite of Jerusalem in the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=}}\n\nJewish and Christian tradition identified this author as the 5th century BC figure [[Ezra]], who gives his name to the [[Book of Ezra]]; Ezra was also believed to be the author of both Chronicles and [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]], but later critical scholarship abandoned the identification with Ezra and called the anonymous author \"the Chronicler\". One of the most striking, although inconclusive,  features of Chronicles is that its closing sentence is repeated as the opening of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah.{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=}} The last half of the 20th century saw a radical reappraisal, and many now regard it as improbable that the author of Chronicles was also the author of the narrative portions of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah.{{sfn|Beentjes|2008|p=3}}\n\n===Sources===\nMuch of the content of Chronicles is a repetition of material from other books of the Bible, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]], and so the usual scholarly view is that these books, or an early version of them, provided the author with the bulk of his material. It is, however, possible that the situation was rather more complex, and that books such as Genesis and [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] should be regarded as contemporary with Chronicles, drawing on much of the same material, rather than a source for it. There is also the question of whether the author of Chronicles used sources other than those found in the Bible: if such sources existed, it would bolster the Bible's case to be regarded as a reliable history. Despite much discussion of this issue, no agreement has been reached.{{sfn|Coggins|2003|p=283}}\n\n===Genre===\nThe translators who created the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible (the [[Septuagint]]) called this book \"Things Left Out\", indicating that they thought of it as a supplement to another work, probably Genesis-Kings, but the idea seems inappropriate, since much of Genesis-Kings has been copied almost without change. Some modern scholars proposed that Chronicles is a [[midrash]], or traditional Jewish commentary, on Genesis-Kings, but again this is not entirely accurate, since the author or authors do not comment on the older books so much as use them to create a new work. Recent suggestions have been that it was intended as a clarification of the history in Genesis-Kings, or a replacement or alternative for it.{{sfn|Beentjes|2008|p=4-6}}\n\n== Themes ==\nThe message which the author wished to give to his audience was this:\n#God is active in history, and especially the history of Israel. The faithfulness or sins of individual kings are immediately rewarded or punished by God. (This is in contrast to the theology of the [[Books of Kings]], where the faithlessness of kings was punished on later generations through the Babylonian exile).{{sfn|Hooker|2001|p=6}} \n#God calls Israel to a special relationship. The call begins with the genealogies (chapters 1\u20139 of 1 Chronicles), gradually narrowing the focus from all mankind to a single family, the Israelites, the descendants of [[Jacob]]. \"True\" Israel is those who continue to worship [[Yahweh]] at the Temple in Jerusalem, with the result that the history of the historical [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] is almost completely ignored.{{sfn|Hooker|2001|p=7-8}} \n#God chose David and his dynasty as the agents of his will. According to the author of Chronicles, the three great events of David's reign were his bringing the [[ark of the Covenant]] to Jerusalem, his founding of an eternal royal dynasty, and his preparations for the construction of the Temple.{{sfn|Hooker|2001|p=7-8}} \n#God chose the Temple in Jerusalem as the place where he should be worshiped. More time and space are spent on the construction of the Temple and its rituals of worship than on any other subject. By stressing the central role of the Temple in pre-exilic Judah, the author also stresses the importance of the newly-rebuilt Persian-era Second Temple to his own readers.\n#God remains active in Israel. The past is used to legitimise the author's present: this is seen most clearly in the detailed attention he gives to the Temple built by Solomon, but also in the genealogy and lineages, which connect his own generation to the distant past and thus make the claim that the present is a continuation of that past.{{sfn|Hooker|2001|p=6-10}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n*[[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n: {{cite book\n|last                         = Beentjes\n|first                        = Pancratius C.\n|editor1-last                 = \n|editor1-first                = \n|editor2-last                 = \n|editor2-first                = \n|chapter                      = \n|title                        = Tradition and Transformation in the Book of Chronicles\n|year                         = 2008\n|publisher                    = Brill\n|url                          = https://books.google.com/?id=rLFXnQ6b9v4C&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|ref                          = harv\n|isbn                         = 9789004170445\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last                         = Coggins\n|first                        = Richard J. \n|editor1-last                 = Dunn\n|editor1-first                = James D.

The leaves are not drawn.]]\n\nIn [[computer science]], '''binary search trees''' ('''BST'''), sometimes called '''ordered''' or '''sorted binary trees''', are a particular type of [[Collection (abstract data type)|container]]: [[data structure]]s that store \"items\" (such as numbers, names etc.) in [[computer memory|memory]]. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either [[Set (abstract data type)|dynamic sets]] of items, or [[lookup table]]s that allow finding an item by its ''key'' (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).\n\nBinary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of [[binary search]]: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes [[time complexity|time proportional to]] the [[logarithm]] of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the [[linear time]] required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on [[hash table]]s.\n\nSeveral variants of the binary search tree have been studied in computer science; this article deals primarily with the basic type, making references to more advanced types when appropriate.\n\n==Definition==\nA binary search tree is a [[rooted tree|rooted]] [[binary tree]], whose internal nodes each store a key (and optionally, an associated value) and each have two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted ''left'' and ''right''. The tree additionally satisfies the [[binary search]] property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree.<ref name=\"clrs\">{{Introduction to Algorithms|3}}</ref>{{rp|287}} The leaves (final nodes) of the tree contain no key and have no structure to distinguish them from one another. \n\nFrequently, the information represented by each node is a record rather than a single data element.  However, for sequencing purposes, nodes are compared according to their keys rather than any part of their associated records. The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related [[sorting algorithm]]s and [[search algorithm]]s such as [[in-order traversal]] can be very efficient; they are also easy to code.\n\nBinary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[set (computer science)#Multiset|multisets]], and [[associative array]]s.\n* When inserting or searching for an element in a binary search tree, the key of each visited node has to be compared with the key of the element to be inserted or found.\n* The shape of the binary search tree depends entirely on the order of insertions and deletions, and can become degenerate.\n* After a long intermixed sequence of random insertion and deletion, the expected height of the tree approaches square root of the number of keys, {{math|{{radic|''n''}}}}, which grows much faster than {{math|log ''n''}}.\n* There has been a lot of research to prevent degeneration of the tree resulting in worst case time complexity of {{math|log ''n''}} (for details see section [[#Types|Types]]).\n\n=== Order relation ===\nBinary search requires an order relation by which every element (item) can be compared with every other element in the sense of a [[total preorder]]. The part of the element which effectively takes place in the comparison is called its ''key''. Whether duplicates, i.e. different elements with same key, shall be allowed in the tree or not, does not depend on the order relation, but on the application only.\n\nIn the context of binary search trees a total preorder is realized most flexibly by means of a [[three-way comparison]] [[subroutine]].\n\n==Operations==\nBinary search trees support three main operations: insertion of elements, deletion of elements, and lookup (checking whether a key is present).\n\n===Searching===\nSearching a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed [[recursion (computer science)|recursively]] or [[iteration#Computing|iteratively]].\n\nWe begin by examining the [[tree (data structure)#root nodes|root node]]. If the tree is ''null'', the key we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the key is less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is ''null''. If the searched key is not found after a ''null'' subtree is reached, then the key is not present in the tree. This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm (implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]):\n\n<source lang=\"python\" line>\ndef search_recursively(key, node):\n    if node is None or node.key == key:\n        return node\n    if key < node.key:\n        return search_recursively(key, node.left)\n    # key > node.key\n    return search_recursively(key, node.right)\n</source>\n\nThe same algorithm can be implemented iteratively:\n\n<source lang=\"python\" line=\"1\">\ndef search_iteratively(key, node): \n    current_node = node\n    while current_node is not None:\n        if key == current_node.key:\n            return current_node\n        if key < current_node.key:\n            current_node = current_node.left\n        else: # key > current_node.key:\n            current_node = current_node.right\n    return current_node\n</source>\nThese two examples rely on the order relation being a total order.\n\nIf the order relation is only a total preorder a reasonable extension of the functionality is the following: also in case of equality search down to the leaves in a direction specified by the user. A [[Tree sort|binary tree sort]] equipped with such a comparison function becomes [[Sorting algorithm#Stability|stable]].\n\nBecause in the worst case this algorithm must search from the root of the tree to the leaf farthest from the root, the search operation takes time proportional to the tree's ''height'' (see [[Tree (data structure)#Terminology|tree terminology]]). On average, binary search trees with {{math|''n''}} nodes have {{math|[[big O notation|O]](log ''n'')}} height.{{refn|group=note|The notion of an average BST is made precise as follows. Let a random BST be one built using only insertions out of a sequence of unique elements in random order (all permutations equally likely); then the [[expected value|expected]] height of the tree is {{math|O(log ''n'')}}. If deletions are allowed as well as insertions, \"little is known about the average height of a binary search tree\".<ref name=\"clrs\" />{{rp|300}}}} However, in the worst case, binary search trees can have {{math|O(''n'')}} height, when the unbalanced tree resembles a [[linked list]] ([[binary Tree#Types of binary trees|degenerate tree]]).\n\n===Insertion===<!-- This section is linked from [[Red-black tree]] -->\nInsertion begins as a search would begin; if the key is not equal to that of the root, we search the left or right subtrees as before. Eventually, we will reach an external node and add the new key-value pair (here encoded as a record 'newNode') as its right or left child, depending on the node's key. In other words, we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if its key is less than that of the root, or the right subtree if its key is greater than or equal to the root.\n\nHere's how a typical binary search tree insertion might be performed in a binary tree in [[C++]]:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\nvoid insert(Node*& root, int key, int value) {\n  if (!root) \n    root = new Node(key, value);\n  else if (key == root->key)\n    root->value = value;\n  else if (key < root->key)\n    insert(root->left, key, value);\n  else  // key > root->key\n    insert(root->right, key, value);\n}\n</source>\n\nThe above ''destructive'' procedural variant modifies the tree in place. It uses only constant heap space (and the iterative version uses constant stack space as well), but the prior version of the tree is lost. Alternatively, as in the following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] example, we can reconstruct all ancestors of the inserted node; any reference to the original tree root remains valid, making the tree a [[persistent data structure]]:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef binary_tree_insert(node, key, value):\n   if node is None:\n       return NodeTree(None, key, value, None)\n   if key == node.key:\n       return NodeTree(node.left, key, value, node.right)\n   if key < node.key:\n       return NodeTree(binary_tree_insert(node.left, key, value), node.key, node.value, node.right)\n   return NodeTree(node.left, node.key, node.value, binary_tree_insert(node.right, key, value))\n</source>\n\nThe part that is rebuilt uses {{math|[[big O notation|O]](log ''n'')}} space in the average case and {{math|O(''n'')}} in the worst case.\n\nIn either version, this operation requires time proportional to the height of the tree in the worst case, which is {{math|O(log ''n'')}} time in the average case over all trees, but {{math|O(''n'')}} time in the worst case.\n\nAnother way to explain insertion is that in order to insert a new node in the tree, its key is first compared with that of the root. If its key is less than the root's, it is then compared with the key of the root's left child. If its key is greater, it is compared with the root's right child. This process continues, until the new node is compared with a leaf node, and then it is added as this node's right or left child, depending on its key: if the key is less than the leaf's key, then it is inserted as the leaf's left child, otherwise as the leaf's right child.\n\nThere are other ways of inserting nodes into a binary tree, but this is the only way of inserting nodes at the leaves and at the same time preserving the BST structure.\n\n===Deletion===<!--This section is linked from [[Red-black tree]]-->\nWhen removing a node from a binary ''search'' tree it is mandatory to maintain the in-order sequence of the nodes.\nThere are many possibilities to do this. However, the following method which has been proposed by T. Hibbard in 1962<ref>s. [[Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|Robert Sedgewick]], Kevin Wayne: [http://www.albertstam.com/Algorithms.pdf ''Algorithms Fourth Edition.''] Pearson Education, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-321-57351-3}}, p. 410.</ref> guarantees that the heights of the subject subtrees are changed by at most one.\nThere are three possible cases to consider:\n* Deleting a node with no children: simply remove the node from the tree.\n* Deleting a node with one child: remove the node and replace it with its child.\n* Deleting a node with two children: call the node to be deleted ''D''.  Do not delete ''D''.  Instead, choose either its [[tree traversal|in-order]] predecessor node or its in-order successor node as replacement node ''E'' (s. figure). Copy the user values of ''E'' to ''D''.<ref group=\"note\">Of course, a generic software package has to work the other way around: It has to leave the user data untouched and to furnish ''E'' with all the BST links to and from ''D''.</ref> If ''E'' does not have a child simply remove ''E'' from its previous parent ''G''. If ''E'' has a child, say ''F'', it is a right child. Replace ''E'' with ''F'' at ''E''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> parent.\n[[File:AVL-tree-delete.svg|thumb|500px|right|Deleting a node with two children from a binary search tree. First the leftmost node in the right subtree, the in-order successor ''E'', is identified. Its value is copied into the node ''D'' being deleted. The in-order successor can then be easily deleted because it has at most one child. The same method works symmetrically using the in-order predecessor ''C''.]]\n\nIn all cases, when ''D'' happens to be the root, make the replacement node root again.\n\nBroadly speaking, nodes with children are harder to delete. As with all binary trees, a node's in-order successor is its right subtree's left-most child, and a node's in-order predecessor is the left subtree's right-most child. In either case, this node will have only one or no child at all. Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above.\n\nConsistently using the in-order successor or the in-order predecessor for every instance of the two-child case can lead to an [[self-balancing binary search tree|unbalanced]] tree, so some implementations select one or the other at different times.\n\nRuntime analysis: Although this operation does not always traverse the tree down to a leaf, this is always a possibility; thus in the worst case it requires time proportional to the height of the tree. It does not require more even when the node has two children, since it still follows a single path and does not visit any node twice.\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef find_min(self):   # Gets minimum node in a subtree\n    current_node = self\n    while current_node.left_child:\n        current_node = current_node.left_child\n    return current_node\n\ndef replace_node_in_parent(self, new_value=None):\n    if self.parent:\n        if self == self.parent.left_child:\n            self.parent.left_child = new_value\n        else:\n            self.parent.right_child = new_value\n    if new_value:\n        new_value.parent = self.parent\n\ndef binary_tree_delete(self, key):\n    if key < self.key:\n        self.left_child.binary_tree_delete(key)\n        return\n    if key > self.key:\n        self.right_child.binary_tree_delete(key)\n        return\n    # delete the key here\n    if self.left_child and self.right_child: # if both children are present\n        successor = self.right_child.find_min()\n        self.key = successor.key\n        successor.binary_tree_delete(successor.key)\n    elif self.left_child:   # if the node has only a *left* child\n        self.replace_node_in_parent(self.left_child)\n    elif self.right_child:  # if the node has only a *right* child\n        self.replace_node_in_parent(self.right_child)\n    else:\n        self.replace_node_in_parent(None) # this node has no children\n</source>\n\n===Traversal===\n{{main article|Tree traversal}}\nOnce the binary search tree has been created, its elements can be retrieved [[in-order traversal|in-order]] by [[recursion|recursively]] traversing the left subtree of the root node, accessing the node itself, then recursively traversing the right subtree of the node, continuing this pattern with each node in the tree as it's recursively accessed. As with all binary trees, one may conduct a [[pre-order traversal]] or a [[post-order traversal]], but neither are likely to be useful for binary ''search'' trees. An in-order traversal of a binary search tree will always result in a sorted list of node items (numbers, strings or other comparable items).\n\nThe code for in-order traversal in Python is given below. It will call '''[[Callback (computer programming)|callback]]''' (some function the programmer wishes to call on the node's value, such as printing to the screen) for every node in the tree.\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef traverse_binary_tree(node, callback):\n    if node is None:\n        return\n    traverse_binary_tree(node.leftChild, callback)\n    callback(node.value)\n    traverse_binary_tree(node.rightChild, callback)\n</source>\n\nTraversal requires {{math|[[big O notation|O]](''n'')}} time, since it must visit every node. This algorithm is also {{math|O(''n'')}}, so it is [[asymptotically optimal]].\n\nTraversal can also be implemented [[Iteration#Computing|iteratively]]. For certain applications, e.g. greater equal search, approximative search, an operation for {{anchor|sst}}''single step (iterative) traversal'' can be very useful. This is, of course, implemented without the callback construct and takes {{math|O(1)}} on average and {{math|O(log ''n'')}} in the worst case.\n\n===Verification===\nSometimes we already have a binary tree, and we need to determine whether it is a BST. This problem has a simple recursive solution.\n\nThe BST property\u2014every node on the right subtree has to be larger than the current node and every node on the left subtree has to be smaller than the current node\u2014is the key to figuring out whether a tree is a BST or not. The [[greedy algorithm]]\u2014simply traverse the tree, at every node check whether the node contains a value larger than the value at the left child and smaller than the value on the right child\u2014does not work for all cases. Consider the following tree:\n\n      20\n     /  \\\n   10    30\n        /  \\\n       5    40\n\nIn the tree above, each node meets the condition that the node contains a value larger than its left child and smaller than its right child hold, and yet it is not a BST: the value 5 is on the right subtree of the node containing 20, a violation of the BST property.\n\nInstead of making a decision based solely on the values of a node and its children, we also need information flowing down from the parent as well. In the case of the tree above, if we could remember about the node containing the value 20, we would see that the node with value 5 is violating the BST property contract.\n\nSo the condition we need to check at each node is: \n* if the node is the left child of its parent, then it must be smaller than (or equal to) the parent and it must pass down the value from its parent to its right subtree to make sure none of the nodes in that subtree is greater than the parent\n* if the node is the right child of its parent, then it must be larger than the parent and it must pass down the value from its parent to its left subtree to make sure none of the nodes in that subtree is lesser than the parent.\n\nA recursive solution in C++ can explain this further:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nstruct TreeNode {\n    int key;\n    int value;\n    struct TreeNode *left;\n    struct TreeNode *right;\n};\n\nbool isBST(struct TreeNode *node, int minKey, int maxKey) {\n    if (node == NULL) return true;\n    if (node->key < minKey || node->key > maxKey) return false;\n    \n    return isBST(node->left, minKey, node->key-1) && isBST(node->right, node->key+1, maxKey);\n}\n</source>\n\n<code>node->key+1</code> and <code>node->key-1</code> are done to allow only distinct elements in BST.\n\nIf we want same elements to also be present, then we can use only <code>node->key</code> in both places.\n\nThe initial call to this function can be something like this:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nif (isBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)) {\n    puts(\"This is a BST.\");\n} else {\n    puts(\"This is NOT a BST!\");\n}\n</source>\n\nEssentially we keep creating a valid range (starting from [MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE]) and keep shrinking it down for each node as we go down recursively.\n\nAs pointed out in section [[#Traversal]], an in-order traversal of a binary ''search'' tree returns the nodes sorted. Thus we only need to keep the last visited node while traversing the tree and check whether its key is smaller (or smaller/equal, if duplicates are to be allowed in the tree) compared to the current key.\n\n==Examples of applications==\n\n===Sort===\n{{main article|Tree sort}}\nA binary search tree can be used to implement a simple [[sorting algorithm]]. Similar to [[heapsort]], we insert all the values we wish to sort into a new ordered data structure\u2014in this case a binary search tree\u2014and then traverse it in order.\n\nThe worst-case time of <code>build_binary_tree</code> is {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}\u2014if you feed it a sorted list of values, it chains them into a [[linked list]] with no left subtrees. For example, <code>build_binary_tree([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</code> yields the tree <code>(1 (2 (3 (4 (5)))))</code>.\n\nThere are several schemes for overcoming this flaw with simple binary trees; the most common is the [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. If this same procedure is done using such a tree, the overall worst-case time is {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}, which is [[asymptotically optimal]] for a [[comparison sort]]. In practice, the added overhead in time and space for a tree-based sort (particularly for node [[dynamic memory allocation|allocation]]) make it inferior to other asymptotically optimal sorts such as  [[heapsort]] for static list sorting. On the other hand, it is one of the most efficient methods of ''incremental sorting'', adding items to a list over time while keeping the list sorted at all times.\n\n===Priority queue operations===\nBinary search trees can serve as [[priority queue]]s: structures that allow insertion of arbitrary key as well as lookup and deletion of the minimum (or maximum) key. Insertion works as previously explained. ''Find-min'' walks the tree, following left pointers as far as it can without hitting a leaf:\n\n ''// Precondition: T is not a leaf''\n '''function''' find-min(T):\n     '''while''' hasLeft(T):\n         T ? left(T)\n     '''return''' key(T)\n\n''Find-max'' is analogous: follow right pointers as far as possible. ''Delete-min'' (''max'') can simply look up the minimum (maximum), then delete it. This way, insertion and deletion both take logarithmic time, just as they do in a [[binary heap]], but unlike a binary heap and most other priority queue implementations, a single tree can support all of ''find-min'', ''find-max'', ''delete-min'' and ''delete-max'' at the same time, making binary search trees suitable as [[double-ended priority queue]]s.<ref name=\"mehlhorn\">{{cite book |last1=Mehlhorn |first1=Kurt |author1-link=Kurt Mehlhorn|first2=Peter |last2=Sanders|author2-link=Peter Sanders (computer scientist) |title=Algorithms and Data Structures: The Basic Toolbox |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |url=http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Toolbox/SortedSequences.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|156}}\n\n==Types==\nThere are many types of binary search trees. [[AVL tree]]s and [[red-black tree]]s are both forms of [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s. A [[splay tree]] is a binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements nearer to the root. In a [[treap]] (''tree [[heap (data structure)|heap]]''), each node also holds a (randomly chosen) priority and the parent node has higher priority than its children. [[Tango tree]]s are trees optimized for fast searches.\n[[T-tree]]s are binary search trees optimized to reduce storage space overhead, widely used for in-memory databases\n\nA degenerate tree is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one associated child node. It is unbalanced and, in the worst case, performance degrades to that of a linked list. If your add node function does not handle re-balancing, then you can easily construct a degenerate tree by feeding it with data that is already sorted. What this means is that in a performance measurement, the tree will  essentially behave like a linked list data structure.\n\n===Performance comparisons===\nD. A. Heger (2004)<ref>{{Citation | title=A Disquisition on The Performance Behavior of Binary Search Tree Data Structures | first1=Dominique A. | last1=Heger | year=2004 | journal=European Journal for the Informatics Professional | volume=5 | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-2004-V.pdf | issue=5 | pages=67\u201375}}</ref> presented a performance comparison of binary search trees. [[Treap]] was found to have the best average performance, while [[red-black tree]] was found to have the smallest amount of performance variations.\n\n===Optimal binary search trees===\n{{Main article|Optimal binary search tree}}\n[[File:BinaryTreeRotations.svg|thumb|300px|Tree rotations are very common internal operations in binary trees to keep perfect, or near-to-perfect, internal balance in the tree.]]\nIf we do not plan on modifying a search tree, and we know exactly how often each item will be accessed, we can construct<ref>{{cite web|last=Gonnet|first=Gaston|title=Optimal Binary Search Trees|url=http://linneus20.ethz.ch:8080/4_7_1.html|work=Scientific Computation|publisher=ETH Z\u00fcrich|accessdate=1 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012033537/http://linneus20.ethz.ch:8080/4_7_1.html|archivedate=12 October 2014|df=}}</ref> an ''optimal binary search tree'', which is a search tree where the average cost of looking up an item (the ''expected search cost'') is minimized.\n\nEven if we only have estimates of the search costs, such a system can considerably speed up lookups on average. For example, if you have a BST of English words used in a [[spell checker]], you might balance the tree based on word frequency in [[text corpus|text corpora]], placing words like ''the'' near the root and words like ''agerasia'' near the leaves. Such a tree might be compared with [[Huffman tree]]s, which similarly seek to place frequently used items near the root in order to produce a dense information encoding; however, Huffman trees store data elements only in leaves, and these elements need not be ordered.\n\nIf we do not know the sequence in which the elements in the tree will be accessed in advance, we can use [[splay tree]]s which are asymptotically as good as any static search tree we can construct for any particular sequence of lookup operations.\n\n''Alphabetic trees'' are Huffman trees with the additional constraint on order, or, equivalently, search trees with the modification that all elements are stored in the leaves. Faster algorithms exist for ''optimal alphabetic binary trees'' (OABTs).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Binary search algorithm]]\n* [[Search tree]]\n* [[Self-balancing binary search tree]]\n* [[AVL tree]]\n* [[Red\u2013black tree]]\n* [[Randomized binary search tree]]\n* [[Tango tree]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{DADS|Binary Search Tree|binarySearchTree}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Cormen|first1=Thomas H. |authorlink1=Thomas H.

An artifact, which in some textbooks is called an ''extended binary tree'' is needed for that purpose. An extended binary tree is thus recursively defined as:<ref name=\"Rosen2011\"/>\n* the [[empty set]] is an extended binary tree\n* if T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are extended binary trees, then denote by T<sub>1</sub> \u2022 T<sub>2</sub> the extended binary tree obtained by adding a root ''r'' connected to the left to T<sub>1</sub> and to the right to T<sub>2</sub> by adding edges when these sub-trees are non-empty.\n\nAnother way of imagining this construction (and understanding the terminology) is to consider instead of the empty set a different type of node\u2014for instance square nodes if the regular ones are circles.<ref name=\"HuShing2002\">{{cite book|author1=Te Chiang Hu|author2=Man-tak Shing|title=Combinatorial Algorithms|year=2002|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41962-6|page=162}}</ref>\n\n=== Using graph theory concepts ===\nA binary tree is a [[rooted tree]] that is also an [[ordered tree]] (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below.

Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one). The size of the tree is taken to be the number ''n'' of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} of them. The number of such binary trees of size ''n'' is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} symbols (representing leaves) separated by ''n'' binary operators (representing internal nodes), so as to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator. For instance for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}} one has to parenthesize a string like {{nowrap| <math>X*X*X*X</math>}}, which is possible in five ways:\n: <math>((X*X)*X)*X,\\qquad (X*(X*X))*X,\\qquad (X*X)*(X*X),\\qquad X*((X*X)*X),\\qquad X*(X*(X*X)).</math>\nThe correspondence to binary trees should be obvious, and the addition of redundant parentheses (around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression) is disallowed (or at least not counted as producing a new possibility).\n\nThere is a unique binary tree of size 0 (consisting of a single leaf), and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children; if these have sizes ''i'' and ''j'' respectively, the full tree has size {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1}}. Therefore, the number <math>C_n</math> of binary trees of size ''n'' has the following recursive description <math>C_0=1</math>, and <math>\\textstyle C_n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}C_iC_{n-1-i}</math> for any positive integer ''n''. It follows that <math>C_n</math> is the [[Catalan number]] of index ''n''.\n\nThe above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2''n'' in the [[Dyck language]], which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced. The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2''n'' is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial '(' and its matching ')' together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2''i'' and 2''j'' satisfy {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1 {{=}} ''n''}}); this number is therefore also the Catalan number <math>C_n</math>. So there are also five Dyck words of length 6:\n: <math>()()(),\\qquad ()(()),\\qquad (())(),\\qquad (()()),\\qquad ((()))</math>.\n\nThese Dyck words do not correspond to binary trees in the same way. Instead, they are related by the following recursively defined bijection: the Dyck word equal to the empty string corresponds to the binary tree of size 0 with only one leaf. Any other Dyck word can be written as (<math>w_1</math>)<math>w_2</math>, where <math>w_1</math>,<math>w_2</math> are themselves (possibly empty) Dyck words and where the two written parentheses are matched. The bijection is then defined by letting the words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> correspond to the binary trees that are the left and right children of the root.\n\nA bijective correspondence can also be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in an extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the [[Lisp (programming language)#S-expressions represent lists|dotted-pair]] expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and '.' as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is in fact the internal representation of the proper list).\n\nThe ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a [[free magma]] on a singleton set.\n\n== Methods for storing binary trees ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ahnentafel]] -->\nBinary trees can be constructed from [[programming language]] primitives in several ways.\n\n=== Nodes and references ===\n\nIn a language with [[record (computer science)|records]] and [[reference (computer science)|references]], binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special [[sentinel node]].\n\nThis method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is [[threaded binary tree]].<ref name=\"Samanta2004\">{{cite book|author=D. Samanta|title=Classic Data Structures|year=2004|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-1874-8|pages=264\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nIn languages with [[tagged union]]s such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a \"leaf\" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers. For example, the following line of code in [[OCaml]] (an ML dialect) defines a binary tree that stores a character in each node.<ref name=\"Scott2009\">{{cite book|author=Michael L. Scott|title=Programming Language Pragmatics|year=2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-092299-7|page=347|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\n<!-- the source gives the example in Standard ML, which has \"datatype\" instead of \"type\", but wikipedia's source tag doesn't support Standard ML. -->\n<source lang=\"ocaml\">\ntype chr_tree = Empty | Node of char * chr_tree * chr_tree\n</source>\n\n=== Arrays ===\n\nBinary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an [[implicit data structure]] in [[array data structure|arrays]], and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index ''i'', its children are found at indices <math>2i + 1</math> (for the left child) and <math>2i +2</math> (for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index ''<math>\\left \\lfloor \\frac{i-1}{2} \\right \\rfloor</math>'' (assuming the root has index zero). This method benefits from more compact storage and better [[locality of reference]], particularly during a preorder traversal. However, it is expensive to grow and wastes space proportional to 2<sup>''h''</sup> - ''n'' for a tree of depth ''h'' with ''n'' nodes.\n\nThis method of storage is often used for [[binary heap]]s. No space is wasted because nodes are added in breadth-first order.\n\n<center>[[Image:Binary tree in array.svg|300px|A small complete binary tree stored in an array]]</center>\n\n== Encodings ==\n\n=== Succinct encodings ===\nA [[succinct data structure]] is one which occupies close to minimum possible space, as established by [[information theory|information theoretical]] lower bounds. The number of different binary trees on <math>n</math> nodes is <math>\\mathrm{C}_{n}</math>, the <math>n</math>th [[Catalan number]] (assuming we view trees with identical ''structure'' as identical). For large <math>n</math>, this is about <math>4^{n}</math>; thus we need at least about <math>\\log_{2}4^{n} = 2n</math> bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy <math>2n+o(n)</math> bits.\n\nOne simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting \"1\" for an internal node and \"0\" for a leaf. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051124175104/http://theory.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.897/spring03/scribe_notes/L12/lecture12.pdf] If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder. This function accomplishes this:\n\n '''function''' EncodeSuccinct(''node'' n, ''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {\n     '''if''' n = ''nil'' '''then'''\n         append 0 to structure;\n     '''else'''\n         append 1 to structure;\n         append n.data to data;\n         EncodeSuccinct(n.left, structure, data);\n         EncodeSuccinct(n.right, structure, data);\n }\n\nThe string ''structure'' has only <math>2n + 1</math> bits in the end, where <math>n</math> is the number of (internal) nodes; we don't even have to store its length. To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this:\n\n '''function''' DecodeSuccinct(''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {\n     remove first bit of ''structure'' and put it in ''b''\n     '''if''' b = 1 '''then'''\n         create a new node ''n''\n         remove first element of data and put it in n.data\n         n.left = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)\n         n.right = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)\n         '''return''' n\n     '''else'''\n         '''return''' nil\n }\n\nMore sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form.\n\n=== Encoding general trees as binary trees ===\nThere is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] to represent general ordered trees as binary trees. To convert a general ordered tree to binary tree, we only need to represent the general tree in left-child right-sibling way. The result of this representation will automatically be a binary tree, if viewed from a different perspective. Each node ''N'' in the ordered tree corresponds to a node ''N' '' in the binary tree; the ''left'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to the first child of ''N'', and the ''right'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to ''N'' 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of ''N''. This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a [[left-child right-sibling binary tree]] (LCRS tree), or a [[doubly chained tree]], or a [[Filial-Heir chain]].\n\nOne way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a [[linked list]], chained together with their ''right'' fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its ''left'' field.\n\nFor example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}.  It can be converted into the binary tree on the right.\n\n<center>\n[[Image:N-ary to binary.svg|400x240px|An example of converting an n-ary tree to a binary tree]]\n</center>\n\nThe binary tree can be thought of as the original tree tilted sideways, with the black left edges representing ''first child'' and the blue right edges representing ''next sibling''.  The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as:\n\n:(((N O) I J) C D ((P) (Q)) F (M))\n\nwhich would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right, without any letters on those nodes that have a left child.\n\n== Common operations ==\n[[File:BinaryTreeRotations.svg|thumb|300px|[[Tree rotation]]s are very common internal operations on [[Self-balancing binary search tree|self-balancing binary trees]].]]\nThere are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are [[mutator method|mutator]] operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.\n\n=== Insertion ===\nNodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after a [[leaf node]]. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.\n\n==== Leaf nodes ====\nTo add a new node after leaf node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent.\n\n==== Internal nodes ====\n[[File:Insertion of binary tree node.svg|thumb|360px|The process of inserting a node into a binary tree]]\nInsertion on [[internal node]]s is slightly more complex than on leaf nodes. Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.\n\n=== Deletion ===\nDeletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree.  Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.<ref name=\"rice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp212/03-spring/lectures/22/|title=Binary Tree Structure|author=Dung X. Nguyen|year=2003|work= |publisher=rice.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}\n</ref>\n\n==== Node with zero or one children ====\n[[File:Deletion of internal binary tree node.svg|thumb|360px|The process of deleting an internal node in a binary tree]]\nSuppose that the node to delete is node A. If A has no children, deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A's parent to [[null pointer|null]]. If A has one child, set the parent of A's child to A's parent and set the child of A's parent to A's child.\n\n==== Node with two children ====\nIn a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously.<ref name=\"rice\"/> However, in certain binary trees (including [[binary search tree]]s) these nodes ''can'' be deleted, though with a rearrangement of the tree structure.\n\n=== Traversal ===\n{{Main|Tree traversal}}\n\nPre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root.\n\n==== Depth-first order ====\nIn depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root node that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See [[depth-first search]] for more information.\n\n==== Breadth-first order ====\nContrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited. See [[breadth-first search]] for more information. Also called a ''level-order traversal''.\n\nIn a complete binary tree, a node's breadth-index (''i'' \u2212 (2<sup>''d''</sup> \u2212 1)) can be used as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit ''d'' \u2212 1, where ''d'' is the node's distance from the root (''d'' = \u230alog2(''i''+1)\u230b) and the node in question is not the root itself (''d'' > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit ''d'' \u2212 1, the bit values <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt> mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating a complete binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[2\u20133 tree]]\n* [[2\u20133\u20134 tree]]\n* [[AA tree]]\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[AVL tree]]\n* [[B-tree]]\n* [[Binary space partitioning]]\n* [[Huffman tree]]\n* [[K-ary tree]]\n* [[Kraft's inequality]]\n* [[Optimal binary search tree]]\n* [[Random binary tree]]\n* [[Recursion (computer science)]]\n* [[Red\u2013black tree]]\n* [[Rope (computer science)]]\n* [[Self-balancing binary search tree]]\n* [[Splay tree]]\n* [[Strahler number]]\n* [[Tree of primitive Pythagorean triples#Alternative methods of generating the tree]]\n* [[Unrooted binary tree]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* [[Donald Knuth]].

The Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra is actually the ''completion'' of the Borel \u03c3-algebra, which means that it is the smallest \u03c3-algebra which contains all the Borel sets and has a [[complete measure]] on it.

All television episodes starred [[Rowan Atkinson]] as the anti-hero [[Edmund Blackadder]], and [[Tony Robinson]] as Blackadder's [[dogsbody]], [[Baldrick]]. Each series was set in a different historical period, with the two [[protagonist]]s accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example [[Melchett (Blackadder)|Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]) and [[Lord Flashheart]] ([[Rik Mayall]]).\n\nThe first series, ''[[The Black Adder]]'', was written by [[Richard Curtis]] and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. The shows were produced by [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. In 2000, the fourth series, ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', ranked at 16 in the \"[[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]]\", a list created by the [[British Film Institute]]. In the 2004 TV poll to find \"[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]\", ''Blackadder'' was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. It was also ranked as the 9th-best TV show of all time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=20 |title=The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time \u2013 Number 20: Blackadder |work=Empire  |accessdate=5 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\nAlthough each series is set in a different era, all follow the misfortunes of [[Edmund Blackadder]] (played by Atkinson), who in each is a member of a British family dynasty present at many significant periods and places in British history. It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one (the end theme lyrics of series 2, episode \"Head\", specify that he is the great-grandson of the previous), although it is never specified how or when any of the Blackadders (who are usually bachelors) managed to father children.<ref name=bcg>{{British Comedy Guide|sitcom|blackadder}}, URL accessed 25 July 2010</ref>\n\nAs the generations progress, each Blackadder becomes increasingly clever and perceptive, while the family's social status steadily erodes. However, each Blackadder remains a cynical, cowardly opportunist, maintaining and increasing his own status and fortunes, regardless of his surroundings.\n\nThe life of each Blackadder is also entwined with his servant, each from the [[Baldrick]] family line (played by [[Tony Robinson]]). Each generation acts as the dogsbody to his respective Blackadder. They decrease in intelligence (and in personal-hygiene standards) as their masters' intellect increases. Each Blackadder and Baldrick is also saddled with tolerating the presence of a dim-witted [[aristocracy|aristocrat]]. This role was taken in the first two series by [[Lord Percy Percy]], played by [[Tim McInnerny]]; with [[Hugh Laurie]] playing the role in the third and fourth series, as [[George (Blackadder)|Prince George, Prince Regent]]; and [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George]], respectively.\n\nEach series was set in a different period of [[History of the British Isles|British history]], beginning in 1485 and ending in 1917, and comprised six half-hour episodes. The first series, made in 1983, was called ''[[The Black Adder]]'' and was set in the fictional reign of \"[[Richard IV of England (Blackadder)|Richard IV]]\". The second series, ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986), was set during the reign of [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Elizabeth I]]. ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987) was set during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and  ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989) was set in 1917 in the trenches of the [[World War I|Great War]].\n\n==Series and specials==\n{{See also|List of Blackadder episodes}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n===Series 1: ''The Black Adder''===\n{{Main|The Black Adder}}\n''The Black Adder'', the first series of ''Blackadder'', was written by [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] and produced by [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. It originally aired on [[BBC1]] from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian [[Seven Network]].\n\nSet in 1485 at the end of the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]], the series is written as an [[Counterfactual history|alternative history]] in which [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] won the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] only to be mistaken for someone else and murdered, and is succeeded by [[Richard IV of England (Blackadder)|Richard IV]] ([[Brian Blessed]]), one of the [[Princes in the Tower]]. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV's unfavoured second son [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh]] (who calls himself \"The Black Adder\") in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and his eventual quest to overthrow him.\n\nConceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', the series dealt comically with a number of aspects of medieval life in Britain: [[witchcraft]], Royal succession, European relations, the [[Crusade]]s, and the conflict between the Church and the Crown. Along with the secret history, many historical events portrayed in the series were [[anachronism|anachronistic]] (for example, [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople]] had already fallen to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, predating the events in the episode by 33 years); this dramatic licence would continue in the subsequent ''Blackadders''. The filming of the series was highly ambitious, with a large cast and much location shooting. The series also featured [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] dialogue, often adapted for comic effect; the end credits featured the words \"Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare\".\n\n===Series 2: ''Blackadder II''===\n{{Main|Blackadder II}}\n''Blackadder II'' is set in [[Kingdom of England|England]] during the reign of [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558\u20131603), who is portrayed by [[Miranda Richardson]]. The principal character is [[Lord Blackadder|Edmund, Lord Blackadder]], the great-grandson of the original Black Adder. During the series, he regularly deals with the [[British monarchy|Queen]], her obsequious [[Lord Chamberlain]] [[List of Blackadder characters#Melchett|Lord Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]])\u2014his rival\u2014and the Queen's demented former nanny [[Nursie]] ([[Patsy Byrne]]).\n\nFollowing the BBC's request for improvements (and a severe budget reduction), several changes were made. The second series was the first to establish the familiar Blackadder character: cunning, shrewd, and witty, in sharp contrast to the first series' bumbling [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]]. To reduce the cost of production, it was shot with virtually no outdoor scenes (the first series was shot largely on location) and several frequently used indoor sets, such as the Queen's [[throne room]] and Blackadder's front room.\n\nA quote from this series ranked number three in a list of the top 25 television \"putdowns\" of the last 40 years by the ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine: \"The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr. Brain has long since departed, hasn't he, Percy?\"\n\n===Series 3: ''Blackadder the Third''===\n{{Main|Blackadder the Third}}\n\n''Blackadder the Third'' is set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period known as the [[English Regency|Regency]]. In the series, [[Mr. E. Blackadder|Edmund Blackadder]] Esquire is the butler to the [[Prince Regent]], the [[George (Blackadder)|Prince of Wales]] (the prince is played by [[Hugh Laurie]] as a complete [[fop]] and idiot). Despite Edmund's respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently-fluctuating wage packet (as well, it seems, from stealing and selling off the Prince's socks) from the Prince: \"If I'm running short of cash, all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fat-Head for a rise.\"\n\nAs well as Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson in their usual roles, this series starred [[Hugh Laurie]] as the [[George (Blackadder)|Prince Regent]], and [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]] as [[Mrs. Miggins]]. The series features [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] ([[Robbie Coltrane]]), [[William Pitt the Younger]] (Simon Osborne), the [[French Revolution]] (featuring [[Chris Barrie]], [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Tim McInnerny]] as [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]]), over-the-top [[English Renaissance theatre|theatrical actors]] ([[Kenneth Connor]] and [[Hugh Paddick]]), a squirrel-hating [[cross-dressing]] [[highwayman]] ([[Miranda Richardson]]), and a [[duel]] with the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] ([[Stephen Fry]]).\n\n===Series 4: ''Blackadder Goes Forth''===\n{{Main|Blackadder Goes Forth}}\nThis series is set in 1917, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the trenches of the First World War. Another \"big push\" is planned, and [[Captain Blackadder]]'s one goal is to avoid being killed, but his schemes always land him back in the trenches. Blackadder is joined by his [[batman (military)|batman]] [[Baldrick#Blackadder Goes Forth|Private S. Baldrick]] (Tony Robinson) and idealistic [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] twit [[George (Blackadder)#Blackadder Goes Forth|Lieutenant George]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]). [[General Melchett]]  (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French [[ch\u00e2teau]] thirty-five miles from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, [[Kevin Darling|Captain Kevin Darling]] (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder's nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedic value.\n\nThe series' tone is somewhat darker than the other ''Blackadder''s; it details the deprivations of trench warfare as well as the incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass. For example, Baldrick is reduced to making coffee from mud and cooking rats, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops to walk very slowly toward the German lines, because \"it'll be the last thing Fritz will expect.\"\n\nThe final episode, \"[[Goodbyeee]]\", is known for being extraordinarily poignant for a comedy\u2014especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally going \"[[Trench warfare|over the top]]\" and charging off into the fog and smoke of [[no man's land]] to die. In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]], drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals, ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' was placed 16th.\n\n===Specials===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n====Pilot episode====\n{{Main|The Black Adder (pilot episode)}}\nThe ''Blackadder'' pilot was shot but never broadcast on terrestrial TV in the UK (although some scenes were shown in the 25th anniversary special ''Blackadder Rides Again''). One notable difference in the pilot, as in many pilots, is the casting. Baldrick is played not by Tony Robinson, but by [[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]]. Another significant difference is that the character of Prince Edmund presented in the pilot is much closer to the intelligent, conniving Blackadder of the later series than the snivelling, weak buffoon of the original. Set in the year 1582, the script of the pilot is roughly the same as the episode \"[[Born to be King]]\", albeit with some different jokes, with some lines appearing in other episodes of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackadderhall.com/?page_id=276 |title=The Pilot Episode |publisher=Blackadderhall.com |date=20 June 1982 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n====''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years''====\n{{Main|Blackadder: The Cavalier Years}}\nThis special, set in the [[English Civil War]], was shown as part of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'s [[Comic Relief (charity)|Red Nose Day]] on Friday 5 February 1988. The 15-minute episode is set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War. Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King [[Charles I of England]] (played by Stephen Fry, portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, slightly dim character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I's namesake, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|current Prince of Wales]]). However, due to a misunderstanding between [[Oliver Cromwell]] (guest-star [[Warren Clarke]]) and Baldrick, the king is arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]]. The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder's attempts to save the king, as well as improve his standing.\n\n====''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''====\n{{Main|Blackadder's Christmas Carol}}\nThe second special was broadcast on Friday 23 December 1988. In a twist on [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Ebenezer Blackadder]] is the \"kindest and loveliest\" man in England. The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick. This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, \"Bad guys have all the fun\", and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar.\n\n====''Blackadder: Back & Forth''====\n{{Main|Blackadder: Back & Forth}}\n''Blackadder: Back & Forth'' was originally shown in the [[Millennium Dome]] in 2000, followed by a screening on [[Sky1|Sky One]] in the same year (and later on BBC1). It is set on the turn of the [[millennium]], and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends&nbsp;\u2013 modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny)&nbsp;\u2013 that he has built a working [[Time travel in fiction|time machine]]. While this is intended as a clever [[confidence trick|con trick]], the machine surprisingly works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the [[Cretaceous period]], where they manage to cause [[Cretaceous extinction event|the extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s through the use of Baldrick's best-worst-and-only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry [[Tyrannosaurus|T. Rex]]. Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine's dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process that must be corrected before the end.

The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at [[Alnwick Castle]] in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983.<ref>[http://www.alnwickcastle.com/television.php Alnwick Castle official website], URL accessed 2 June 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228031113/http://www.alnwickcastle.com/television.php |date=28 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/locations Locations] at the [[Internet Movie Database]], URL accessed 17 April 2008</ref> The series also used large casts of extras, horses and expensive medieval-style costumes. Atkinson has said about the making of the first series:\n\n<blockquote>The first series was odd, it was very extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six programmes&nbsp;... [which] was a lot of money to spend&nbsp;... It looked great, but it wasn't as consistently funny as we would have liked.<ref name=\"Interviews\"/></blockquote>\n\nDue to the high cost of the first series, the then-controller of programming of [[BBC1]], [[Michael Grade]], was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements to the show and drastic cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.<ref name=\"Lewisohn\">Lewisohn, Mark, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408071319/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/blackadderthe_7770760.shtml ''The Black Adder] at the former [[BBC Guide to Comedy]], URL accessed 17 April 2008</ref> Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nA chance meeting between Richard Curtis and comedian [[Ben Elton]] led to the decision to collaborate on a new series of Blackadder. Recognising the main faults of the first series, Curtis and Elton agreed that ''Blackadder II'' would be a studio-only production (along with the inclusion of a live audience during recording, instead of showing the episodes to an audience after taping). Besides adding a greater comedy focus, Elton suggested a major change in character emphasis: Baldrick would become the stupid [[sidekick]], while Edmund Blackadder evolved into a cunning [[sycophant]]. This led to the familiar set-up that was maintained in the following series.<ref name=\"Britain's Best Sitcom\">''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/advocate_blackadder.shtml Britain's Best Sitcom \u2013 Blackadder]'', 2004 BBC Television documentary, presented by [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]]</ref>\n\nOnly in the ''Back & Forth'' millennium special was the shooting once again on location, because this was a production with a budget estimated at \u00a33&nbsp;million, and was a joint venture between [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect]], [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]], the New Millennium Experience Company and the BBC, rather than the BBC alone.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/419247.stm Blackadder's millennium duel]'', [[BBC News]], Friday, 13 August 1999</ref><ref>'[http://www.blackadderhall.com/library/skyview.html Black to the Future \u2013 Interview with Tony Robinson]' in ''Skyview'', January 2000 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024303/http://www.blackadderhall.com/library/skyview.html |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212579/trivia Trivia] at the Internet Movie Database, URL accessed 20 April 2008</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Main|List of Blackadder characters}}\nEach series tended to feature the same set of regular actors in different period settings, although throughout the four series and specials, only Blackadder and Baldrick were constant characters.

Baldrick]], his servant.\n*[[Stephen Fry]] played Melchett in two series, first as [[List of Blackadder characters#Melchett|Lord Melchett]], the sycophantic adviser to [[Queenie (Blackadder)|Queen Elizabeth I]] in series two and secondly as [[General Melchett]], a blustering buffoon and presumed descendant in series four. Fry also appeared as [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], The Duke Of Wellington in series three and as various characters in ''Blackadder Back & Forth''.\n*[[Tim McInnerny]] played [[Lord Percy Percy]], Blackadder's dimwitted sidekick in series one and two before a change of character to antagonist Captain [[Kevin Darling]] in series four. He also appeared as [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]] (alias Lord Topper and [[Le Comte de Frou Frou]]) for one episode in the third series, and reprised his role as Darling in ''Blackadder: Back & Forth''.\n*[[Hugh Laurie]] played [[George (Blackadder)|George]] in series three and four, first as HRH [[George IV of the United Kingdom|The Prince Regent]], and later Lieutenant George in series four. Laurie also appeared twice in series two; firstly as Simon \"Farters Parters\" Partridge and then as Prince Ludwig the Indestructible in the final instalment of ''Blackadder II''. He similarly reprised this role in ''Back & Forth''.\n*[[Miranda Richardson]] was only a regular cast member for series two, where she played [[Queenie (Blackadder)#Blackadder II|Queen Elizabeth I]], reprising the role in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'' and ''Back & Forth''. However, she also played significant one-off roles as [[Amy Hardwood]] (a.k.a. The Shadow) in \"[[Amy and Amiability (Blackadder)|Amy and Amiability]]\" in the third series and Mary Fletcher-Brown, a dutiful nurse in \"[[General Hospital (Blackadder)|General Hospital]]\" from the fourth.\n\n====Non-recurring cast====\n*[[Brian Blessed]], [[Elspet Gray]] and [[Robert East (actor)|Robert East]] appeared in all six episodes of the first series as the Black Adder's father, mother and brother respectively. Gray had also appeared in the non-broadcast pilot.\n*[[Patsy Byrne]] played Nursie in all six episodes of ''[[Blackadder II]]'', but never featured in either of the subsequent series, either as a regular character or one-off. She briefly reprised the character in ''[[Blackadder: Back & Forth]]'' and ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''.\n*[[Helen Atkinson-Wood]] played the role of [[Mrs. Miggins]] in all six episodes of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'', but did not appear again in the series, although the character was mentioned several times in ''Blackadder II'' and in the final episode of ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''.\n\n====Guest cast====\n[[Ben Elton]]'s arrival after the first series heralded the more frequent recruitment of comic actors from the [[alternative comedy]] era for guest appearances, including [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Rik Mayall]] (who had appeared in the final episode of the first series as \"Mad Gerald\"), [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Nigel Planer]], [[Mark Arden]], [[Stephen Frost]], [[Chris Barrie]] and [[Jeremy Hardy]]. Elton himself played an anarchist in ''Blackadder the Third''.\n\n[[Gabrielle Glaister]] played [[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]], an attractive girl who poses as a man, in both series 2 and 4. [[Rik Mayall]] plays [[Lord Flashheart]], a vulgar friend in his first appearance and then a successful rival of Blackadder in a later episode of series 2 and 4. He also played a decidedly Flashheart-like [[Robin Hood]] in ''Back & Forth''. [[Lee Cornes]] also appeared in an episode of all three Curtis-Elton series. He appeared as a guard in the episode \"Chains\" of ''Blackadder II''; as the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] in the episode \"Ink and Incapability' of ''Blackadder the Third''; and as firing squad soldier [[Private (rank)|Private]] Fraser in the episode \"Corporal Punishment\" of ''Blackadder Goes Forth''.\n\nMore established actors, some at the veteran stage of their careers, were also recruited for roles. These included [[Peter Cook]], [[John Grillo]], [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], [[Tom Baker]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Paddick]], [[Frank Finlay]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Bill Wallis]], [[Ronald Lacey]], Roger Blake, [[Denis Lill]], [[Warren Clarke]] and [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]], who played [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig]] in \"[[Goodbyeee]]\", the final episode of ''Blackadder Goes Forth''. [[Miriam Margolyes]] played three different guest roles: The Spanish Infanta in [[The Queen of Spain's Beard (Blackadder)|The Queen of Spain's Beard]], Lady Whiteadder in [[Beer (Blackadder)|Beer]], and [[Queen Victoria]] in [[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]].\n\nUnusually for a sitcom based loosely on factual events and in the historical past, a man was recruited for one episode essentially to play himself. Political commentator [[Vincent Hanna]] played a character billed as \"his own great-great-great grandfather\" in the episode \"[[Dish and Dishonesty (Blackadder)|Dish and Dishonesty]]\" of ''Blackadder the Third''. Hanna was asked to take part because the scene was of a by-election in which Baldrick was a candidate and, in the style of modern television, Hanna gave a long-running \"live\" commentary of events at the count (and interviewed candidates and election agents) to a crowd through the [[town hall]] window.\n\n===Theme tune===\n[[Howard Goodall]]'s [[theme music|theme tune]] has the same [[melody]] throughout all the series, but is played in roughly the [[History of music|style of the period]] in which it is set. It is performed mostly with trumpets and [[timpani]] in ''The Black Adder'', the fanfares used suggesting typical medieval court fanfares; with a combination of [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[string quartet]] and electric guitar in ''Blackadder II''; on [[oboe]], cello and [[harpsichord]] (in the style of a [[minuet]]) for ''Blackadder the Third''; by The Band of the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment]] in ''Blackadder Goes Forth''; sung by [[Carol (music)|carol singers]] in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''; and by an orchestra in ''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'' and ''Blackadder: Back & Forth''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardgoodall.co.uk/works/tv-and-film/blackadder |title=List of Musicians and Singers who Played or Sang on Blackadder and Red Dwarf Themes |publisher=Howardgoodall.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2000, the fourth series, ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', ranked at 16 in the \"[[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]]\", a list created by the [[British Film Institute]]. In 2004, a BBC TV poll for \"[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]\", ''Blackadder'' was voted the second best British sitcom of all time, topped by ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Final Top 10 Sitcoms|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/winner.shtml|publisher=BBC|date=March 2004}}</ref> It was also ranked as the 20th Best TV Show of All Time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"empire\"/>\n\n==Future==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}\nDespite regular statements denying any plans for a fifth series, cast members are regularly asked about the possibility of a new series.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn January 2005, Tony Robinson told [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' that Rowan Atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past to do a fifth series, set in the 1960s (centred on a rock band called the \"Black Adder Five\", with [[Baldrick]]&nbsp;\u2013 a.k.a. 'Bald Rick'&nbsp;\u2013 as the drummer). In the documentary ''Blackadder Rides Again'', Robinson stated that the series would present Blackadder as the bastard son of Queen Elizabeth II and running a Beatles-like rock band. Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson would have reprised their roles, and reportedly, Brian Blessed, Elspet Gray and Robert East would have returned from the first series to play Blackadder's biological family. Robinson in a stage performance 1 June 2007, again mentioned this idea, but in the context of a movie.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nOne idea mentioned by Curtis was that it was Baldrick who had accidentally [[John F.

Furthermore, in November 2005, Rowan Atkinson told ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' that, although he would very much like to do a new series set in [[Colditz]] or another [[prisoner-of-war camp]] during World War II, something which both he and Stephen Fry reiterated at the end of ''Blackadder Rides Again'', the chances of it happening are extremely slim.<ref>{{Citation|last=theoldonearethebest|title=Blackadder Rides Again Documentary pt 6 6|date=2011-09-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjOoncjwXgg&list=PL398BAFDB3C5E2009&index=7|accessdate=2017-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThere were a couple of ideas that had previously floated for the fifth series. ''Batadder'' was intended to be a parody of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' with Baldrick as the counterpart of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (suggested by [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]). This idea eventually came to surface as part of the ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' sketch \"[[Spider-Plant Man]]\" in 2005, with Atkinson as [[Spider-Man|the title hero]], Robinson as Robin, [[Jim Broadbent]] as Batman and [[Rachel Stevens]] as [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]. ''Star Adder'' was to be set in space in the future (suggested by Atkinson),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmtv.eserver.org/black-adder.txt |title=Black Adder Program Guide |date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> though this too was touched upon in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 10 April 2007, ''[[Hello!]]'' reported that Atkinson was moving forward with his ideas for a fifth series. He said, \"I like the idea of him being a prisoner of war in Colditz. That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders.\"<ref name=\"Hello-Colditz\">{{cite news\n  | url = http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2007/04/10/blackadder-return/\n  | title = Rowan toys with idea of 'Blackadder' return\n  | work=HelloMagazine.co.uk\n  | publisher=[[Hello!]]\n  | date = 10 April 2007\n  | accessdate = 6 February 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nA post on BlackAdderHall.com by Ben Elton in early 2007 said that ''Blackadder'' would return in some form, whether it be a TV series or film. Elton has since not given any more information on the putative ''Blackadder 5''.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nDuring an interview in August 2007 about his film ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'', Atkinson was asked about the possibility of a further ''Blackadder'' series, to which the simple reply \"No, no chance\" was given:\n\n:\"There was a plan for a film set in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], a very interesting one called ''The Red Adder''. He would have been a lieutenant in the Secret Police. Then the revolution happened and at the end he is in the same office doing the same job but just the colours on his uniform have changed. It was quite a sweet idea and we got quite a long way with it but in the end it died a death.\"{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nStephen Fry has expressed the view that, since the series went out on such a good \"high\", a film might not be a good idea.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120529151802/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060620k.php \"Atkinson Developing \"Black Adder\" Film\"], Darkhorizons.com</ref>\n\nDuring his June 2007 stage performance, chronicled on the Tony Robinson's Cunning Night Out DVD, Robinson states that, after filming the ''Back & Forth special'', the general idea was to reunite for another special in 2010. Robinson jokingly remarked that Hugh Laurie's success on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' may make that difficult.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the end of ''Blackadder Rides Again'', Robinson asked Tim McInnerny if he would do another series and he responded \"no\", because he thought people would not want to see them as they are now and would rather remember them for how they were. In the same documentary, Rowan Atkinson voiced his similar view; 'Times past; that's what they were!' However, Miranda Richardson and Tony Robinson expressed enthusiasm towards the idea of a series set in the Wild West, whilst John Lloyd favoured an idea for a series with a [[Neanderthal]] Blackadder. Lastly, Stephen Fry suggested a series set in a prisoner of war camp during [[World War II]], but later remarked that \"perhaps it's best to leave these things as a memory.\"{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role at the \"We are most amused\" comedy gala for the [[Prince's Trust]] at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/29/we-are-most-amused-review|title=We Are Most Amused \u2013 review|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=2012-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, Tony Robinson said in an interview \"I do think a new series of Blackadder is on the cards.

In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the [[K\u0142odzko Valley]] into [[Silesia]], now part of [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rankin|1996|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThey first appear in history in connection with the [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Celtic invasion of Italia (390\u2013387 BC)|Gallic invasion of north Italy]], 390 BC, when they made the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of Felsina their new capital, [[Bologna|Bononia (Bologna)]]. After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a [[Battle of Mutina (193 BC)|Battle of Mutina]] (193 BC) and their territory became part of the Roman province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. According to [[Strabo]], writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours,{{quote|[T]he Boii were merely driven out of the regions they occupied; and after migrating to the regions round about the [[Danube|Ister]], lived with the [[Taurisci]], and carried on war against the [[Dacians|Daci]] until they perished, tribe and all \u2014 and thus they left their country, which was a part of [[Illyria]], to their neighbours as a pasture-ground for sheep.<ref>Strabo, 5.213.</ref>}}\n\nAround 60 BC, a group of Boii joined the [[Helvetii]]'s ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by [[Julius Caesar]], along with their allies, in the [[Battle of Bibracte]]. Caesar settled the remnants of that group in [[Gorgobina]], from where they sent two thousand to [[Vercingetorix]]'s aid at the [[Battle of Alesia]] six years later. The eastern Boii on the Danube were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] in 8 AD.\n\n==Etymology and name==\nFrom all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions it is possible to abstract a [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] segment, ''boio''-.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names|editor-first=Alexander|editor-last=Falileyev|publisher=Aberystwyth University|year=2007|title=Boii|url=http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731025816/http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]]: from 'cow' and from 'warrior.' The Boii would thus be either \"the herding people\" or \"the warrior people.\"\n\nThe \"cow\" derivation depends most immediately on the [[Old Irish]] legal term for \"outsider:\" ''ambue'', from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*ambouios'' (<''*an-bouios''), \"not a cattle owner.\"<ref>{{cite book|page=225|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|first=John T. |last=Koch|edition= illustrated|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2006|isbn=978-1-85109-440-0|location=Santa Barbara, California}}</ref> In a reference to the first known historical Boii, [[Polybius]] relates<ref name=PB.2.17>''Histories'', II.17.</ref> that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man's status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had. The latter were presumably the ''*ambouii'', as opposed to the man of status, who was ''*bouios'', a cattle owner, and the ''*bouii'' were originally a class, \"the cattle owners.\"\n\n[[File:HallstattIlllyrianFootmanwithJavelins.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of a soldier wearing a plumed pot helmet, [[Hallstatt culture]] bronze belt plaque from [[Va\u010de]], [[Slovenia]], ca. 400 BC]]\nThe \"warrior\" derivation was adopted by the linguist [[Julius Pokorny]], who presented it as being from Indo-European *bhei(\u0259)-, *bh\u012b-, \"hit;\" however, not finding any Celtic names close to it (except for the Boii), he adduces examples somewhat more widely from originals further back in time: phohiio-s-, a [[Venetic language|Venetic]] personal name; Boioi, an [[Illyria]]n tribe; Boi\u014dtoi, a Greek tribal name (\"the [[Boeotia]]ns\") and a few others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|language=German|pages=117\u2013118|encyclopedia=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch|first=Julius|last=Pokorny|authorlink=Julius Pokorny|title=bhei(\u0259)-, bh\u012b-|url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/|publisher=University of Leiden|date=1998\u20132006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207135952/http://www.indoeuropean.nl/|archivedate=7 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Boii would be from the [[apophony|o-grade]] of *bhei-, which is *bhoi-. Such a connection is possible if the original form of Boii belonged to a tribe of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] speakers long before the time of the historic Boii. If that is the case, then the Celtic tribe of central Europe must have been a final daughter population of a linguistically diversifying ancestor tribe.\n\nThe same wider connections can be hypothesized for the \"cow\" derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of [[Italy#Etymology|Italy]] as a \"land of calves.\" Indo-European reconstructions can be made using {{PIE|*g\u02b7ou-}} \"cow\" as a basis, such as {{PIE|*g\u02b7owjeh\u00b3s}};{{sfn|Birkhan|1999|page=99}} the root may itself be echoic of the sound a cow makes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=*gwou-&allowed_in_frame=0|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nContemporary derived words include ''[[Boiorix]]'' (\"king of the Boii\", one of the chieftains of the [[Cimbri]]) and ''Boiodurum'' (\"gate/fort of the Boii\", modern [[Passau]]) in Germany. Their memory also survives in the modern regional names of [[Bohemia]] (''Boiohaemum''), a mixed-language form from boio- and [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''haimaz'', \"home\": \"home of the Boii,\" and 'Bayern', [[Bavaria]], which is derived from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''Baiovarii'' tribe (Germ. ''*baja-warjaz'': the first component is most plausibly explained as a Germanic version of ''Boii''; the second part is a common formational morpheme of Germanic tribal names, meaning 'dwellers', as in [[Old English]] ''-ware'');<ref group=\"note\">Indo-European short ''o'', as in the Celtic ''Boii'', developed to ''a'' in Germanic. As far as its formation is concerned, the name seems to be a hybrid between Celtic or Latin and Germanic, as the thematic vowel ''bai-'''''o'''- would have to be an ''a'' in a Germanic compound (cf. Celtic ''ambio-rix'' vs. Germanic ''\u00feiuda-reiks'', \"Theoderic\"). This, however, should not be used as an argument against the 'traditional' etymology, as such forms are quite common (cf. ''Raetovarii'', an Allemanic tribe) and are most likely influenced by the Latin background of the ancient writers.</ref> this combination \"Boii-dwellers\" may have meant \"those who dwell where the Boii formerly dwelt\".\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Boians.png|upright=1.5|right|thumbnail|400px|Roman accounts of movements of the Boii]]\n\n===Settlement in north Italy===\nAccording to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the [[Alps]]. While of the other tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the [[Senones]], [[Lingones]] and [[Cenomani]] are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest. It remains therefore unclear where exactly the [[Central Europe]]an origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, [[Southern Germany]] or in Bohemia.\n\n[[Polybius]] relates that the [[Celts]] were close neighbors of the [[Etruscan civilization]] and \"cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country.\"<ref name=PB.2.17>''Histories'', II.17.</ref> Invading the [[Po Valley]] with a large army, they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley. [[Strabo]] confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the [[Alps]]<ref>''Geography'', IV.4.1.</ref> and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts.<ref>''Geography'', V.1.6.</ref> The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of Felsina, which they named ''Bononia'' (modern [[Bologna]]). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] as follows:\n{{quote|They lived in unwalled villages, without any superfluous furniture; for as they slept on beds of leaves and fed on meat and were exclusively occupied with war and agriculture, their lives were very simple, and they had no knowledge whatever of any art or science. Their possessions consisted of cattle and gold, because these were the only things they could carry about with them everywhere according to circumstances and shift where they chose. They treated comradeship as of the greatest importance, those among them being the most feared and most powerful who were thought to have the largest number of attendants and associates.<ref name=PB.2.17/>}}\n\nThe archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave. It much rather indicates that the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage.<ref>{{cite book|pages=201\u2013202|title=Beyond the Rubicon: Romans and Gauls in Republican Italy|first=J.

At [[Pianoro|Monte Bibele]] not far away one grave contained La T\u00e8ne weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it.\n\n===War against Rome===\nIn the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome. They also fought alongside [[Hannibal]], killing the Roman general [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 BC)|Lucius Postumius Albinus]] in 216 BC, whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl.<ref>''History of Rome'', XXIII, 24.</ref> A short time earlier, they had been defeated at the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC, and were again at [[Battle of Placentia (194 BC)|Placentia in 194 BC]] (modern [[Piacenza]]) and [[Battle of Mutina (193 BC)|Mutina in 193 BC]] (modern [[Modena]]). After the loss of their capital, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy.\n\n===Boii on the Danube===\nContrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier. The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as [[inhumation]], which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic [[torc]]s.<ref>Cunliffe, Barry: \"The Ancient Celts\", Penguin Books 1999, pp. 72f.</ref> This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round.<ref>{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|p=124}}</ref> Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk.<ref group=\"note\">Other tribes of whom divisions are attested both in the 'Celtic homeland' and at the periphery include the Senones (Umbria and the Marne region), Lingones (Aemilia and the Langres plateau), Cenomani (Venetia and Maine), Tectosages (Galatia and Provence).</ref>\n\nThe Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]] (Strabo VII, 2, 2). Later on, they attacked the city of [[Noreia]] (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to [[Julius Caesar]] - the number is probably an exaggeration) joined the [[Helvetii]] in their attempt to settle in western Gaul. After the Helvetian defeat at [[Bibracte]], the influential [[Aedui]] tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the ''oppidum'' of [[Gorgobina]]. Although attacked by [[Vercingetorix]] during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] (Caes. Bell. Gall., VII, 75).\n\nAgain, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and [[Hungary|Hungarian lowlands]] by the [[Danube]] and the [[Mur River|Mura]], with a centre at [[Bratislava]]. Around 60 BC they clashed with the rising power of the [[Dacians]] under their king [[Burebista]] and were defeated.

Murray}}</ref> It is a two player game where each player has fifteen pieces (''checkers'') which move between twenty-four triangles (''points'') according to the roll of two dice.  The objective of the game is to be first to ''bear off'', i.e. move all fifteen checkers off the board. Backgammon is a member of the [[Tables (board game)|tables]] family, one of the oldest classes of board games.\n\nBackgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like [[poker]].<ref>[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammonluckskill \"Backgammon Luck ''vs'' Skill\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314131358/http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammonluckskill |date=2011-03-14 }}, backgammon.org</ref> With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.\n\nLike [[chess]], backgammon has been studied with great interest by [[Computer science|computer scientists]]. Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players (see [[TD-Gammon]] for an example).\n\n==Rules==\n[[Image:BackgammonBoard.svg|thumb|Board in starting position with two dice and doubling cube]]\n[[Image:Bg-movement.svg|thumb|Paths of movement for red and black, with checkers in the starting position; viewed from the black side, with home or inner board at lower right]]\n\nBackgammon playing pieces are known variously as [[draughts|checkers, draughts]], stones, men, [[Boardgame counter|counters]], pawns, discs, pips, chips, or nips.\n\nThe objective is to remove (''bear off'') all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. In the most often-played variants the checkers are scattered at first; as the game progresses they may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points.\n\n===Setup===\nEach side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points. The points form a continuous track in the shape of a [[horseshoe]], and are numbered from 1 to 24. In the most commonly used setup, each player begins with fifteen checkers, two are placed on their 24-point, three on their 8-point, and five each on their 13-point and their 6-point. The two players move their checkers in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\">{{cite book |last=Robertie |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Robertie |title=Backgammon for Winners |edition=Third |year=2002 |publisher=Cardoza |isbn=978-1-58042-043-3}}</ref>\n\nPoints 1 through 6 are called the home board or inner board, and points 7 through 12 are called the outer board. The 7-point is referred to as the bar point, and the 13-point as the midpoint.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\">{{cite book |title=Hoyle's Rules of Games |edition=Third Revised and Updated |publisher=Signet |year=2001 |pages=321\u2013330 |isbn=978-0-451-20484-4 |author=edited by Albert H. Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith.}}</ref>\n\n===Movement===\n[[File:Backgammon example.ogv|thumb|Video of a game of backgammon, showing movement around the board, entering from the bar, formation of primes, use of the doubling cube and bearing off]]\n\nTo start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using the numbers shown on both dice. If the players roll the same number, they must roll again. Both dice must land completely flat on the right-hand side of the gameboard. The players then take alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/>\n\nAfter rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (denoted as \"6-3\"), the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally: six and then three, or three and then six. If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For example, a roll of 5-5 allows the player to make four moves of five spaces each. On any roll, a player must move according to the numbers on both dice if it is at all possible to do so. If one or both numbers do not allow a legal move, the player forfeits that portion of the roll and his or her turn ends. If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used. If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.\n\nIn the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player's own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or \"blot\". In this case, the blot has been \"hit\", and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface. A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/> There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point at any given time.\n\nCheckers placed on the bar must re-enter the game through the opponent's home board before any other move can be made. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent's 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent's 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent's 6). Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers. Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and placed on the bar. More than one checker can be on the bar at a time. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/> If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move. If the opponent's home board is completely \"closed\" (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves.\n\n===Bearing off===\nWhen all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called \"bearing off\". A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/> For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if there is a way to use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so. If a player's checker is hit while in the process of bearing off, that player may not bear off any others until it has been re-entered into the game and moved into his/her home board, according to the normal movement rules.\n\nThe first player to bear off all fifteen of his/her own checkers wins the game. If the opponent has not yet borne off any checkers when the game ends, the winner scores a ''gammon'', which counts for double stakes. If the opponent has not yet borne off any checkers and has some on the bar or in the winner's home board, the winner scores a ''backgammon'', which counts for triple stakes.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/>\n\n===Doubling cube===\n[[Image:Backgammon DoublingCube.jpg|thumb|Doubling cube]]\nTo speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used. The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled but rather a marker with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides, to denote the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be \"centered, on 1\". When the cube is centered, the player about to roll may propose that the game be played for twice the current stakes. Their opponent must either accept (\"take\") the doubled stakes or resign (\"drop\") the game immediately.\n\nWhenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding [[power of two]] facing upward, to indicate that the right to re-double belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"hoyle\"/> If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, he or she loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of redoubles. Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on. In money games, a player is often permitted to \"'''beaver'''\" when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube.<ref name=\"bill_robertie-beavers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gammonvillage.com/backgammon/news/early_beavers.cfm |title=Backgammon Beavers |accessdate=2007-10-17 |last=Robertie |first=Bill |publisher=GammonVillage }}</ref>\n\nA variant of the doubling cube \"beaver\" is the \"'''raccoon'''\". Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again (\"raccoon\") as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled. The opponent retains the doubling cube. E.g. White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, while Black retains the cube. Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change.\n\nSome players may opt to invoke '''The Murphy rule''' or the \"automatic double rule\". If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points). The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.\n\nThe '''Jacoby rule''', named after [[Oswald Jacoby]], allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted. This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.<ref name=\"robertie-serious\">{{cite book |last=Robertie |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Robertie |title=Backgammon for Serious Players |edition=Second |year=2006 |pages=19\u201322 |publisher=Cardoza |isbn=978-0-940685-68-0}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Crawford rule''', named after [[John R. Crawford]], is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the '''Crawford game'''. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play.<ref name=\"robertie-serious\"/> It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match.\n\nIf the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the '''Holland rule''', named after\n[[Tim Holland (backgammon)|Tim Holland]], which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side. It was common in tournament play in the 1980s but is now rarely used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?pat=holland+rule |title=Backgammon Glossary/Holland Rule |publisher=Bkgm.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n{{Main article|Tables (board game)}}\n[[Image:Alfonso-todas-tablas.jpg|thumb|''Todas tablas'' from the [[Libro de los juegos]]]]\nThere are many variants of standard backgammon rules. Some are played primarily throughout one geographic region, and others add new tactical elements to the game. Variants commonly alter the starting position, restrict certain moves, or assign special value to certain dice rolls, but in some geographic regions even the rules and directions of the checkers' movement change, rendering the game fundamentally different.\n\n'''[[Acey-deucey]]''' is a variant of backgammon in which players start with no checkers on the board, and must bear them on at the beginning of the game. The roll of 1-2 is given special consideration, allowing the player, after moving the 1 and the 2, to select any desired doubles move. A player also receives an extra turn after a roll of 1-2 or of doubles.<ref>''The Backgammon Book'', Chapter 11, O. Jacoby & J. R. Crawford, 1970, Macmillan & Co</ref>\n\n'''[[Hypergammon]]''' is a variant of backgammon in which players have only three checkers on the board, starting with one each on the 24-, 23- and 22-points. The game has been [[solved game|strongly solved]], meaning that exact [[expected value|equities]] are available for all 32 million possible positions.<ref name=Tesauro2002>{{cite journal | author = Tesauro, G. | year = 2002 | title = Programming backgammon using self-teaching neural nets | journal = Artificial Intelligence | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 181\u2013199 | url = http://www.math-info.univ-paris5.fr/~bouzy/Doc/PJR/Backgammon.pdf | accessdate = 2007-08-08 | doi = 10.1016/S0004-3702(01)00110-2 | format = PDF | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050304/http://www.math-info.univ-paris5.fr/~bouzy/Doc/PJR/Backgammon.pdf | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref><ref name=\"strato-variants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gammonlife.com/variants/index.htm |title=Backgammon Variants |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Strato |first=Michael |publisher=Gammonlife | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070913213206/http://www.gammonlife.com/variants/index.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n'''[[N\u0259rd]]''' is a traditional variant from [[Azerbaijan]] in which basic rules are almost the same except that even a single piece is 'safe'.

After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game.\n\n[[File:Backgammon probability.png|thumb|Probability distribution of possible backgammon moves illustrated by division of probabilities into probability of one die, the sum of two dice and the combined probability of the two cases from 1-12. Six has the highest probability to occur during one move in backgammon (44.44%).]]\n\nThe number rolled with the highest probability is six (see picture). Strategies can derive from that. The most direct one is simply to avoid being hit, trapped, or held in a stand-off. A \"running game\" describes a strategy of moving as quickly as possible around the board, and is most successful when a player is already ahead in the race.<ref name=\"magriel\">{{cite book|last=Magriel |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Magriel |title=Backgammon |year=1976 |publisher=Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co |isbn= 978-0-8129-0615-8}}</ref> When this fails, one may opt for a \"holding game\", maintaining control of a point on one's opponent's side of the board, called an anchor. As the game progresses, this player may gain an advantage by hitting an opponent's blot from the anchor, or by rolling large doubles that allow the checkers to escape into a running game.<ref name=\"magriel\"/>\n\nThe \"priming game\" involves building a wall of checkers, called a prime, covering a number of consecutive points. This obstructs opposing checkers that are behind the prime. A checker trapped behind a six-point prime cannot escape until the prime is broken.<ref name=\"magriel\"/> A particularly successful priming effort may lead to a \"blitz\", which is a strategy of covering the entire home board as quickly as possible while keeping one's opponent on the bar. Because the opponent has difficulty re-entering from the bar or escaping, a player can quickly gain a running advantage and win the game, often with a gammon.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/>\n\nA \"backgame\" is a strategy that involves holding two or more anchors in an opponent's home board while being substantially behind in the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?back+game%20game|title=Backgammon Glossary/Back Game|publisher=}}</ref> The anchors obstruct the opponent's checkers and create opportunities to hit them as they move home. The backgame is generally used only to salvage a game wherein a player is already significantly behind. Using a backgame as an initial strategy is usually unsuccessful.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"magriel\"/>\n\n\"Duplication\" refers to the placement of checkers such that one's opponent needs the same dice rolls to achieve different goals. For example, players may position all of their blots in such a way that the opponent must roll a 2 in order to hit any of them, reducing the probability of being hit more than once.<ref name=\"robertie-winners\"/><ref name=\"magriel\"/> \"Diversification\" refers to a complementary tactic of placing one's own checkers in such a way that more numbers are useful.<ref name=\"magriel\"/>\n\nMany positions require a measurement of a player's standing in the race, for example, in making a doubling cube decision, or in determining whether to run home and begin bearing off. The minimum total of pips needed to move a player's checkers around and off the board is called the \"pip count\". The difference between the two players' pip counts is frequently used as a measure of the leader's racing advantage. Players often use [[mental calculation]] techniques to determine pip counts in live play.<ref name=\"magriel\"/>\n\nBackgammon is played in two principal variations, \"Money\" and \"Match\" play. Money play means that every point counts evenly and every game stands alone, whether money is actually being wagered or not. \"Match\" play means that the players play until one side scores (or exceeds) a certain number of points. The format has a significant effect on strategy. In a match, the objective is not to win the maximum possible number of points, but rather to simply reach the score needed to win the match. For example, a player leading a 9-point match by a score of 7\u20135 would be very reluctant to turn the doubling cube, as their opponent could take and make a costless redouble to 4, placing the entire outcome of the match on the current game. Conversely, the trailing player would double very aggressively, particularly if s/he has chances to win a gammon in the current game. In money play, the theoretically correct checker play and cube action would never vary based on the score.\n\nIn 1975, Emmet Keeler and Joel Spencer considered the question of when to double or accept a double using an idealized version of backgammon.  In their idealized version, the probability of winning varies randomly over time by [[Brownian motion]], and there are no gammons or backgammons.  They showed that the optimal time to offer a double was when the probability of winning reached 80%, and it is wise to accept a double only if the probability of winning is at least 20%.  As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb.<ref name=\"keeler\">{{cite journal |last=Keeler |first=Emmet |last2=Spencer |first2=Joel |date=1975 |title=Optimal Doubling in Backgammon |journal=[[Operations Research (journal)|Operations Research]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1063\u20131071 |doi= 10.1287/opre.23.6.1063}}</ref>\n\n==Cheating==\nTo reduce the possibility of cheating, most good quality backgammon sets use [[Dice#Precision dice|precision dice]] and a [[dice cup]].<ref name=\"Dummies\">{{cite book|last1=Bray|first1=Chris|title=Backgammon for Dummies|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-69456-5|page=13 and 224}}</ref> This reduces the likelihood of [[Loaded dice|loaded dice]] being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrington Green|first1=Jonathan|title=An exposure of the arts and miseries of gambling|publisher=Redding|year=1845|page=203}}</ref> A common method of cheating online is the use of a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player's moves resemble those of a backgammon program.

Backgammon is not such a game. Everything is in front of you. The person who uses that information in the most effective manner will win.\"\n\nAfter the closing arguments, Judge Stephen S.

[[Artificial neural network|Neural networks]] and other approaches have offered significant advances to software for gameplay and analysis.\n\nThe first strong computer opponent was BKG 9.8. It was written by [[Hans Berliner]] in the late 1970s on a DEC [[PDP-10]] as an experiment in evaluating board game positions. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitional phases in the game. He applied principles of [[fuzzy logic]] to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the reigning world champion [[Luigi Villa]]. It won the match, 7\u20131, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game.

The text assigns its invention to the Persian sage Wuzurgmihr (Persian) [[Burzoe|Buzarjumihr/Bozorgmehr]], who was the minister of King [[Khosrau I|Khosrow I]]. According to the historical legend, the Indian king Dewisarm sends his minister Taxritos to [[Persia]] with the game of [[chess]], and a letter challenging Sasanian King Khosrow I to solve the riddle or rationale for the game. Khosrow asks for three days to decipher the game, but initially no-one in the court is able to make any progress.

Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces.

A powerful multi-national (or more accurately, multi-ethnic) coalition headed by the king of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], the most important northern city, is defeated with Yahweh's help. Hazor itself is then captured and destroyed. Chapter 11:16\u201323 summarises the extent of the conquest: Joshua has taken the entire land, almost entirely through military victories, with only the Gibeonites agreeing to peaceful terms with Israel. The land then \"had rest from war\" (Joshua 11:23, repeated at 14:15). Chapter 12 lists the vanquished kings on both sides of the [[Jordan River]]: the two kings who ruled east of the Jordan who were defeated under Moses' leadership (Joshua 12:1-6; cf. Numbers 21), and the 31 kings on the west of the Jordan who were defeated under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 12:7-24).

The Israelites are told - just as Joshua himself had been told (Joshua 1:7) - that they must comply with \"all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses\" (Joshua 23:6), neither \"turn[ing] aside from it to the right hand or to the left\" (i.e. by adding to the law, or diminishing from it).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Poole|first1=Matthew|title=Commentary on the Holy Bible: Joshua 23|date=1853|publisher=Robert Carter & Brothers via BibleHub|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joshua/23.htm}}</ref>\n\nJoshua meets again with all the people at [[Shechem]] in chapter 24 and addresses them a second time. He recounts the history of God's formation of the Israelite nation, beginning with \"[[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]] and [[Nahor, son of Terah|Nahor]], [who] lived beyond the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] and worshiped other gods\" ({{Bibleref2|Joshua|24:2|NIV| Joshua 24:2}}). He invited the Israelites to choose between serving the Lord who had delivered them from [[Egypt]], or the gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land they now lived. The people chose to serve the Lord, a decision which Joshua recorded in the Book of the Law of God. He then erected a memorial stone \"under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord\" in Shechem (Joshua 24:1-27). The oak is associated with the Oak of [[Moreh]] where Abram had set up camp during his travels in this area (Genesis 12:6).{{cn|date=August 2017}} Thus \"Joshua made a covenant with the people\", literally \"cut a covenant\", a phrase common to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]] languages.

He later published a book of the meeting transcripts. In a lecture at Ben-Gurion's home, archaeologist [[Yigael Yadin]] argued for the historicity of the Israelite military campaign and remarked on how much easier it was for military experts to appreciate the plausibility of the Joshua narrative. Yadin specifically pointed to the conquests of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Bethel]], and [[Lachish]]. Conversely, archaeologist [[Yohanan Aharoni]] argued against the historicity of the early Israelite campaigns, instead favoring a migration model.<ref name=Havrelock/>\n\nRachel Havrelock herself argues that the myth of conquest, although shaped by ardent nationalists with a military agenda, could be re-interpreted for the purposes of a decentralized post-nationalism.<ref name=Havrelock/>\n\nBy the same token, the Biblical narrative of conquest has been used as an apparatus of critique against Zionism.

The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions, written in [[Aramaic]] while the surrounding text is in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (1:2-4, 4:8-16, 4:17-22, 5:7-17, 6:3-5, 6:6-12, 7:12-26) <ref name=torrey>{{cite journal|last1=Torrey|first1=C.

''Decree of Cyrus, first version'': [[Cyrus (Bible)|Cyrus]], inspired by God, returns the Temple vessels to [[Sheshbazzar]], \"prince of Judah\", and directs the Israelites to return to Jerusalem with him and rebuild the Temple.\n*2. 42,360 exiles, with men servants, women servants and \"singing men and women\", return from Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of [[Zerubbabel]] and [[Jeshua the High Priest]].\n*3. [[Jeshua the High Priest]] and Zerubbabel build the altar and celebrate the [[Feast of Tabernacles]]. In the second year the foundations of the Temple are laid and the dedication takes place with great rejoicing.\n*4. ''Letter of the Samaritans to Artaxerxes, and reply of Artaxerxes'': The \"enemies of Judah and Benjamin\" offer to help with the rebuilding, but are rebuffed; they then work to frustrate the builders \"down to the reign of Darius.\" The officials of Samaria write to king Artaxerxes warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt, and the king orders the work to stop. \"Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.\"\n*5. ''Tattenai's letter to Darius'': Through the exhortations of the prophets [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], Zerubbabel and Joshua recommence the building of the Temple. [[Tatnai|Tattenai]], satrap over both Judah and Samaria, writes to Darius warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt and advising that the archives be searched to discover the decree of Cyrus.\n*6. ''Decree of Cyrus, second version, and decree of Darius'': Darius finds the decree, directs Tattenai not to disturb the Jews in their work, and exempts them from tribute and supplies everything necessary for the offerings. The Temple is finished in the month of Adar in the sixth year of Darius, and the Israelites assemble to celebrate its completion.\n\n;''Chapters 7\u201310''\n*7. ''Letter of Artaxerxes to Ezra (Artaxerxes' rescript)'': King Artaxerxes is moved by God to commission Ezra \"to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God\" and to \"appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates\u2014all who know the laws of your God.\" Artaxerxes gives Ezra much gold and directs all Persian officials to aid him.\n*8. Ezra gathers a large body of returnees and much gold and silver and precious vessels for the Temple and camps by a canal outside Babylon. There he discovers he has no Levites, and so sends messengers to gather some. The exiles then return to Jerusalem, where they distribute the gold and silver and offer sacrifices to God.\n*9. Ezra is informed that some of the Jews already in Jerusalem have married non-Jewish women. Ezra is appalled at this proof of sin, and prays to God: \"O God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.\"\n*10. Despite the opposition of some of their number, the Israelites assemble and send away their foreign wives and children.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nIn the early 6th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Kingdom of Judah]] rebelled against the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and was destroyed. As a result, the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes were taken into captivity in the city of [[Babylon]]. There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to [[Jerusalem]] and rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of [[great power]], and in 539&nbsp;BC [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]], the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IfxMeDl6BZgC&dq=The+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Fensham, F.

Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams. When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them 'ten times better' than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]].{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=19\u201320}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Cyrus\">Cyrus: Persian conqueror of Babylon, 539 BC.</ref>\n\n=== Nebuchadnezzar's dream of four kingdoms (chapter 2) ===\n{{Main|Daniel 2}}\nIn the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=31\u201333}}\n\n=== The fiery furnace (chapter 3) ===\n{{Main|Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego}}\nDaniel's companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar's golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace. Nebuchadnezzar is astonished to see a fourth figure in the furnace with the three, one \"with the appearance like a son of the gods.\" So the king called the three to come out of the fire, and blessed the God of Israel, and decreed that any who blasphemed against him should be torn limb from limb.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=50\u201351}}\n\n=== Nebuchadnezzar's madness (chapter 4) ===\n{{main|Daniel 4}}\n[[File:William Blake - Nebuchadnezzar (Tate Britain).jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Nebuchadnezzar'' by [[William Blake]] (between c. 1795 and 1805)]]\nNebuchadnezzar recounts a dream of a huge tree that is suddenly cut down at the command of a heavenly messenger. Daniel is summoned and interprets the dream. The tree is Nebuchadnezzar himself, who for seven years will lose his mind and live like a wild beast. All of this comes to pass until, at the end of the specified time, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that \"heaven rules\" and his kingdom and sanity are restored.{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=1241}}\n\n=== Belshazzar's feast (chapter 5) ===\n{{main|Belshazzar's feast}}\n{{see also|Fall of Babylon}}\n[[Belshazzar]] and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a hand mysteriously appears and [[The writing on the wall|writes upon the wall]]. The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids him for his lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar's kingdom will be given to the [[Medes]] and [[Achaemenid empire|Persians]].

The Persian army which captured Babylon was under the command of a certain Gobryas (or Gubaru), on behalf of Cyrus, the Persian king. The author of Daniel may have introduced the reference to a Mede in order to fulfill Isaiah and Jeremiah, who prophesied that the Medes would overthrow Babylon, confusing the events of 539 with those of 520 BC, when Darius I captured Babylon after an uprising.

Knowing of Daniel's devotion to his God, his enemies trick the king into issuing an edict forbidding worship of any other god or man for a 30-day period. Daniel continues to pray three times a day to God towards Jerusalem; he is accused and King Darius, forced by his own decree, throws Daniel into the lions' den. But God shuts up the mouths of the lions, and the next morning Darius rejoices to find him unharmed. The king casts Daniel's accusers into the lions' pit together with their wives and children to be instantly devoured, while he himself acknowledges Daniel's God as he whose kingdom shall never be destroyed.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=1245\u20131247}}\n\n=== Vision of the beasts from the sea (chapter 7) ===\n{{Main|Daniel 7}}\n{{See also|Four kingdoms of Daniel}}\nIn the first year of [[Belshazzar]] Daniel has a dream of four monstrous beasts arising from the sea.<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"First year of Belshazzar\">First year of Belshazzar: Probably 553 BC, when Belshazzar was given royal power by his father, [[Nabonidus]].

A divine being explains that the four beasts represent four kings, but that \"the holy ones of the Most High\" would receive the everlasting kingdom. The fourth beast would be a fourth kingdom with ten kings, and another king who would pull down three kings and make war on the \"holy ones\" for \"a time, two times and a half,\" after which the heavenly judgement will be made against him and the \"holy ones\" will receive the everlasting kingdom.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=1248\u20131249}}\n\n=== Vision of the ram and goat (chapter 8) ===\n{{Main|Daniel 8}}\nIn the third year of Belshazzar Daniel has vision of a ram and goat. The ram has two mighty horns, one longer than the other, and it charges west, north and south, overpowering all other beasts. A goat with a single horn appears from the west and destroys the ram. The goat becomes very powerful until the horn breaks off and is replaced by four lesser horns. A small horn that grows very large, it stops the daily temple sacrifices and desecrates the sanctuary for two thousand three hundred \"evening and mornings\" (which could be either 1150 or 2300 days) until the temple is cleansed. The [[angel Gabriel]] informs him that the ram represents the Medes and Persians, the goat is Greece, and the \"little horn\" is a wicked king.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=1249\u20131251}}\n\n=== Vision of the Seventy Weeks (chapter 9) ===\n{{Main|Prophecy of Seventy Weeks}}\nIn the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel meditates on the word of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years; he confesses the sin of Israel and pleads for God to restore Israel and the \"desolated sanctuary\" of the Temple. The angel [[Gabriel]] explains that the seventy years stand for seventy \"weeks\" of years (490 years), during which the Temple will first be restored, then later defiled by a \"prince who is to come,\" \"until the decreed end is poured out.\"{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=1251\u20131252}}\n\n=== Vision of the kings of north and south (chapters 10\u201312) ===\n{{Main|Daniel's final vision}}\nDaniel 10: In the third year of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Third year of Cyrus\">\"Third year of Cyrus\": 536 BC. The author has apparently counted back seventy years to the \"third year of Jehoiakim,\" 606 BC, to round out Daniel's prophetic ministry. See Towner, p. 149.</ref> Daniel sees in his vision an angel (called \"a man\", but clearly a supernatural being) who explains that he is in the midst of a war with the \"prince of Persia\", assisted only by [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], \"your prince.\" The \"prince of Greece\" will shortly come, but first he will reveal what will happen to Daniel's people.\n\nDaniel 11: A future king of Persia will make war on the king of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], a \"mighty king\" will arise and wield power until his empire is broken up and given to others, and finally the king of the south (identified in verse 8 as [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) will go to war with the \"king of the north.\" After many battles (described in great detail) a \"contemptible person\" will become king of the north; this king will invade the south two times, the first time with success, but on his second he will be stopped by \"ships of Kittim.\" He will turn back to his own country, and on the way his soldiers will desecrate the Temple, abolish the daily sacrifice, and set up the [[abomination of desolation]]. He will defeat and subjugate [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] and Egypt, but \"reports from the east and north will alarm him,\" and he will meet his end \"between the sea and the holy mountain.\"\n\nDaniel 12: At this time Michael will come. It will be a time of great distress, but all those whose names are written will be delivered. \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt; those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.\" In the final verses the remaining time to the end is revealed: \"a time, times and half a time\" (three years and a half). Daniel fails to understand and asks again what will happen, and is told: \"From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.\"\n\n=== Additions to Daniel (Greek text tradition) ===\n[[File:Guido Reni - Susanna and the Elders - WGA19296.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Susanna and the Elders'' by [[Guido Reni]] (1820\u20131825)]]\n{{Main|Additions to Daniel}}{{see also|Deuterocanonical books}}\n\nThe Greek text of Daniel is considerably longer than the Hebrew, due to three additional stories: they remain in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Bibles but were rejected by the Protestant movement in the 16th century on the basis that they were absent from Jewish Bibles.{{sfn|McDonald|2012|p=57}}\n* [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]], placed after Daniel 3:23;\n* The story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna and the Elders]], placed before chapter 1 in some Greek versions and after chapter 12 in others;\n* The story of [[Bel and the Dragon]], placed at the end of the book.\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Daniel refuse kingsfood.jpg|thumb|Daniel refusing to eat at the King's table, early 1900s Bible illustration]]\n\nThe visions of chapters 7\u201312 reflect the crisis which took place in Judea in 167\u2013164 BC when [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], the Greek king of the [[Seleucid Empire]], threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=109\u2013110}} When Antiochus came to the throne in 175 BC the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid. The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked\u2014or more accurately, paid\u2014to be allowed to make Jerusalem a ''[[polis]]'', or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=6\u201313}}\n\nAntiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BC, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}} Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BC an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple.{{sfn|Sacchi|2010|pp=225\u2013226}} With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.{{sfn|Grabbe|2010|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nThe crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices.{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=407}} But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BC and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40\u201343) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44\u201345) was inaccurate (he died in Persia).{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=6\u20137}} The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BC, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167-163 BCE.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=7}}{{sfn|Ryken|Longman|2010|p=325}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Songe Nabuchodonosor arbre.jpg|thumb|upright|Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the felled tree (France, 15th century).]]\n\n=== Development ===\nIt is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=42}} The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=34}} Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of  to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}} The visions of chapters 7\u201312 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n=== Authorship ===\nDaniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them [[pseudonym]]ous.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|p=2}} The stories of the first half are considered legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] period (2nd century BC).{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=2}}\n\nAlthough the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1\u20136 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7\u201312) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=295}} The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is [[Wiktionary:mantic|mantic]] (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning\u2014the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002b|pp=229\u2013230, 243}}{{sfn|Davies|2006|p=340}}\n\nIt is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} [[Ezekiel]], who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with [[Noah]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|2003|p=69}} \"The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character&nbsp;... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}\n\n=== Dating ===\nThe prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BC. Chapters 10\u201312 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=101}}\n\nFurther evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's [[Nevi'im|canon of the prophets]], which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of [[Sirach]], a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the [[Sibylline Oracles]] commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century.{{sfn|Hammer|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThe Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter [[Masoretic Text]] and in two longer Greek versions, the original [[Septuagint]] version, c. 100&nbsp;BC, and the later [[Theodotion]] version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three [[additions to Daniel]]: [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]; the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]]; and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]]. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.{{sfn|Harrington|1999|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=89}}{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=3}}\n\nEight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at [[Qumran]], two in [[Qumran Caves|Cave 1]], five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6. Between them, they preserve text from eleven of Daniel's twelve chapters, and  the twelfth is quoted in the [[Florilegium]] (a compilation scroll) 4Q174, showing that the book at Qumran did not lack this conclusion. All eight manuscripts were copied between 125&nbsp;BC (4QDan<sup>c</sup>) and about 50 AD (4QDan<sup>b</sup>), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], switches to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.{{sfn|VanderKam|Flint|2013|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n== Genre, meaning, symbolism and chronology ==\n[[File:Daniel dans la fosse aux lions.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniel in the lions' den saved by [[Habakkuk]] (France, 15th century).]]\n\n''(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)''\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Book of Daniel is an [[apocalypse]], a [[literary genre]] in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and [[pseudonymity]] (false authorship).{{sfn|Crawford|2000|p= 73}} The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BC to 100 AD, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Persians and [[Egyptians]].{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of divine revelation: he has learned the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge; he is one of the [[maskil (honorific)|''maskilim'']] (\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself.{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp= 397\u2013406}} The book is also an [[eschatology]], as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom.{{sfn|Carroll|2000|pp= 420\u2013421}} It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them.{{sfn|Redditt|2009|p= 187}}\n\n=== Meaning, symbolism and chronology ===\nThe message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression.{{sfn|Brettler|2005|p=218}} The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament\u2014\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist\u2014the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=1\u20132}} The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.\n\n* The ''four kingdoms'' and the ''little horn'' (Daniel 2 and 7): The concept of four successive world empires stems from Greek theories of mythological history;{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} most modern interpreters agree that the four represent [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], the [[Medes]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]], ending with Hellenistic [[Seleucid Syria]] and with Hellenistic [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=34\u201336}} The symbolism of four metals in the statue in chapter 2 comes from Persian writings,{{sfn|Niskanen|2004|pp=27, 31}} while the four \"beasts from the sea\" in chapter 7 reflect Hosea 13:7\u20138, in which God threatens that he will be to Israel like a lion, a leopard, a bear or a wild beast.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=80}} The consensus among scholars is that the four beasts of chapter 7, like the metals of chapter 2, symbolise Babylon, Media, Persia and the [[Seleucids]], with [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] (reigned 175\u2013164 BC) as the \"small horn\" that uproots three others (Antiochus usurped the rights of several other claimants to become king of the Seleucid Empire).{{sfn|Matthews|Moyes|2012|pp=260,269}}\n* The ''Ancient of Days'' and the ''one like a son of man'' (Daniel 7): The portrayal of God in Daniel [http://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm 7:13] resembles the portrayal of the [[Canaan]]ite god [[El (deity)|El]] as an ancient divine king presiding over the divine court.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3\u20134}} The \"Ancient of Days\" gives dominion over the earth to \"one like a [[son of man]]\", and then in [http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm Daniel 7:27] to \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\", whom scholars consider the son of man to represent. These people can be understood as the ''maskilim'' (sages), or as the Jewish people broadly.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002a|pp=60\u201361, 282}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Son of Man\">\"Son of man\" (''bar 'ena\u0161'' in Hebrew) simply means \"a human being\", but in the context of Daniel 7 it may be a heavenly figure, possibly the archangel Michael functioning as a representative of the Jewish people (Collins 1977:144\u201346; opposed by Davies 1985:105\u2013106). Scholars almost universally agree that this human figure represents \"the people of the holy ones of the Most High\" of Daniel 7:27, originally the ''maskilim'' community or group responsible for the composition of Daniel, but in later interpretation it is taken to mean the Jewish people as a whole. See Grabbe 2002a.</ref>\n*''The ram and he-goat'' (Daniel 8) as conventional astrological symbols represent Persia and Syria, as the text explains. The \"mighty horn\" stands for [[Alexander the Great]]  (reigned 336\u2013323 BC) and the \"four lesser horns\" represent the four principal generals ([[Diadochi]]) who fought over the Greek empire following Alexander's death. The \"little horn\" again represents Antiochus IV. The key to the symbols lies in the description of the little horn's actions: he ends the continual burnt offering and overthrows the Sanctuary, a clear reference to Antiochus' desecration of the Temple.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=87}}\n* The ''anointed ones'' and the ''seventy years'' (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'s \"seventy years\" prophecy regarding the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon. From the point of view of the Maccabean era, Jeremiah's promise was obviously not true\u2014the gentiles still oppressed the Jews, and the \"desolation of Jerusalem\" had not ended. Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy \"weeks\" of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven \"weeks\" from the \"going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem\" to the coming of an \"anointed one\", while the final \"week\" is marked by the violent death of another \"anointed one\", probably the High Priest [[Onias III]] (ousted to make way for [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple. The point of this for Daniel is that the period of gentile power is predetermined, and is coming to an end.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Matthews|Moyer|2012|p=260}}\n* ''Kings of north and south'': Chapters 10 to 12 concern the war between these kings, the events leading up to it, and its heavenly meaning. In chapter 10 the angel (Gabriel?) explains that there is currently a war in heaven between Michael, the angelic protector of Israel, and the \"princes\" (angels) of Persia and Greece; then, in chapter 11, he outlines the human wars which accompany this\u2014the mythological concept sees standing behind every nation a god/angel who does battle on behalf of his people, so that earthly events reflect what happens in heaven. The wars of the [[Ptolemies]] (\"kings of the south\") against the Seleucids (\"kings of the north\") are reviewed down to the career of [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus the Great]] (Antiochus III (reigned 222\u2013187 BC), father of Antiochus IV), but the main focus is Antiochus IV, to whom more than half the chapter is devoted. The accuracy of these predictions lends credibility to the real prophecy with which the passage ends, the death of Antiochus\u2014which, in the event, was not accurate.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=110\u2013111}}\n* ''Predicting the end-time'' (Daniel 8:14 and 12:7\u201312): Biblical eschatology does not generally give precise information as to when the end will come,{{sfn|Carroll|2000|p=420}} and Daniel's attempts to specify the number of days remaining is a rare exception.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=114}} Daniel asks the angel how long the \"little horn\" will be triumphant, and the angel replies that the Temple will be reconsecrated after 2300 \"evenings and mornings\" have passed (Daniel 8:14). The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last \"for a time, times and half a time\", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the \"desolation\" will last for 1290 days (12:11); and finally, 1335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after the lapse of the 1150 days of chapter 8, and 12:12 after the lapse of the number in 12:11.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=99}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Merian's Daniel 7 engraving.jpg|thumb|320px|Engraving of Daniel's vision of the four beasts in chapter 7 by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1630.]]\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe concepts of [[immortality]] and [[resurrection]], with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\"{{sfn|Cohn|2002|pp=86\u201387}} Without this belief, [[Christianity]], in which the [[resurrection of Jesus]] plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=2}}\n\nDaniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time.{{sfn|Grabbe|2002|p=244}} Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the [[Montanism|Montanists]] of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their [[millennialism]], to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the [[Zwickau prophets]] and the [[M\u00fcnster Rebellion]].{{sfn|Towner|1984|pp=2\u20133}} During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchy Men]] took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus.{{sfn|Weber|2007|p=374}} Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the [[Second Coming]].{{sfn|Boyer|1992|pp=24, 30\u201331}}\n\nThe influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the [[Hijri year|Muslim era]].{{sfn|Doukhan|2000|p=9}}\n\n=== Western culture ===\nDaniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\".{{sfn|Godden|2013|p=231}} In the early modern period the physicist [[Isaac Newton]] paid special attention to it, and [[Francis Bacon]] borrowed a [[motto]] from it for his work ''[[Novum Organum]]''.

Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], [[Dick Tracy]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]], made the character a master sleuth.<ref>Boichel, Bill. \"Batman: Commodity as Myth.\" ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous.' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.<ref name=autogenerated1 />}}\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Subsequent creation credit====\nKane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the other credits.\n\nFinger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\"<ref name=\"creation\" /> At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.\n\n[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'':\n{{quote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why&nbsp;...

Finger said, \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\",<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=25}}</ref> and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.<ref>Wright, Bradford W.

Creators including [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Dick Sprang]] also worked on the strips during this period.\n\nOver the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. \"About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman\", Kane said.<ref name = \"vapzdg\">{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=29}}</ref> [[Batman's utility belt|Batman's characteristic utility belt]] was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939), followed by the [[boomerang]]-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the [[Batplane]], in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger.

Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 84.</ref> Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]], a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry.

Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was \"planning to kill Batman off altogether\".<ref>{{harvp|Daniels|1999|p=95}}</ref> In response to this, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the \"New Look\". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired.

Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again.

Bruce decided to take his crime-fighting cause globally, which is the central focus of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''Batman and Robin'', while Wayne would be the main character in ''Batman Incorporated''. Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''.\n\n====The New 52====\n\n{{See also|The New 52}}\nIn September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its ''Batman'' franchise, were canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of [[the New 52]] [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']], ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. ''Batman Incorporated'' was relaunched in 2012\u20132013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline.\n\nWith the beginning of the New 52, [[Scott Snyder]] was the writer of the ''Batman'' title. His first major story arc was \"[[Night of the Owls]]\", where Batman confronts the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was \"[[Death of the Family]]\", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was \"[[Batman: Zero Year]]\", which redefined Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed ''Batman'' #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years. The final storyline before the \"[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]\" (2015) storyline was \"[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]\", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.\n\nStarting with ''Batman'' vol. 2, #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] special comic ''Divergence''. However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, [[Julie Madison]], but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a \"strange star\" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne.

The series then began shipping twice-monthly as a third volume, starting with ''Batman'' vol. 3, #1 (Aug. 2016). The third volume of ''Batman'' was written by [[Tom King (comic book writer)|Tom King]], and artwork was provided by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]] and Mikel Jan\u00edn. The ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' series introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl.

Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=Batman versus Superman as class warfare?

Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in ''Batman'' and ''Detective'' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the ''Brave and the Bold'' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.\"<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil\" p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that \"there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes\".<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 31.</ref> Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939), Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Batman #1 Spring 1940, Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref> and to train his body into physical perfection<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAnother of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions\".<ref>{{harvp|Pearson|Uricchio|1991|p=194}}</ref> The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\" />\n\nBatman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories.

Pagnucci |page=27}}</ref>\n\n===Others===\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Batman}}\nOn several occasions former Robin [[Dick Grayson]] has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010.<ref name=\"visual\"/> As part of DC's [[The New 52|2011 continuity relaunch]], Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the ''Flashpoint'' crossover event.\n\nIn an interview with [[IGN]], Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and [[Damian Wayne]] as Robin represented a \"reverse\" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, \"a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin\". Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the [[Teen Titans]], and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; {{sic|hide=y|He's}} a lot looser and more relaxed.\"<ref name=\"comics.ign.com\"/>\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence.  [[Jean Paul Valley]], also known as [[Azrael]], assumed the cowl after the events of the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga.<ref name=\"visual\"/> [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] donned a mech-suit after the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'', and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016.\n\nAdditionally, members of the group [[Batman, Incorporated]], Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.<ref name=\"visual\"/> Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.\n\n====Supporting characters====\n{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}\n\nBatman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\" />\n\n=====Adversaries=====\n[[File:BatmanRoguesGallery.jpg|thumb|Batman surrounded by his enemies. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]\n{{Main|List of Batman Family adversaries}}\n\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.<ref name = \"Boichel_p8\"/> These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's ''[[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic rogues gallery|rogues gallery]]''. Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a \"personification of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything Batman [opposes]\".<ref name = \"Boichel_p9\"/> Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include [[Catwoman]] (a [[burglary|cat burglar]] antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Clayface]], and [[Killer Croc]] among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at [[Arkham Asylum]].\n\n=====Allies=====\n\n;Alfred\n{{Main|Alfred Pennyworth}}\nBatman's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], first appeared in ''Batman'' #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character \"[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand\" to the hero and his sidekick.<ref name = \"Boichel_p8\">Boichel, p. 8.</ref>\n\n;\"Batman Family\"\nThe informal name \"[[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman family]]\" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. They include: [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of [[Batgirl]] and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Oracle; [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]] and as Batgirl for a brief stint; [[Cassandra Cain]], the daughter of professional assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], and [[Lady Shiva]], who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.\n\n;Civilians\n[[Lucius Fox]], a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities; [[Leslie Thompkins|Dr. Leslie Thompkins]], a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; [[Vicki Vale]], an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], Batman's canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s;<ref name=\"138D\">Daniels (1995), p. 138.</ref> and [[Bat-Mite]], an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.<ref name=\"138D\" />\n\n;GCPD\n{{main|Gotham City Police Department}}\n\nAs Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James \"Jim\" Gordon]] debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting [[everyman]], he shares Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] does in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.\n\n;Justice League\n{{main|Justice League}}\n\nBatman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of ''World's Finest'' and ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (Dec. 2003), [[Superman]] observes, \"Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him.\"<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | title = [[Superman/Batman]] | story = Running Wild | issue = 3 | date = Dec. 2003 | publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n;Robin\n{{anchor|Robin}}\n{{Main|Robin (comics)}}\n\n[[File:Batman & Robin (Batman vol. 1 -9 Feb. 1942).jpg|thumb|upright|Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the [[Red Hood]], and became an [[antihero]] vigilante with no qualms about using [[firearms]] or [[deadly force]]. [[Carrie Kelly]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.\n\nThe third Robin in mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity The Spoiler,  and later as [[Batgirl]].<ref>Langley, 180\u2013210</ref> After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time.

Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being \"Gotham's most eligible bachelor\". Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations. The most significant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle, who is also [[Catwoman]]<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">geek-news.mtv.com/2011/03/22/batman's-top-10-love-interests/{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> and [[Talia al Ghul]], as both women gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.\n\nBatman's first romantic interest was [[Julie Madison]] in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #31 (Sept. [[1939 in comics|1939]]), however their romance was short-lived. Some of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as [[Julie Madison]], [[Vicki Vale]], and [[Silver St. Cloud]]. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as [[Batwoman#Kathy Kane|Kathy Kane (Batwoman)]], [[Sasha Bordeaux]], and [[Wonder Woman]], and with villains, such as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle (Catwoman)]], Jezebel Jet, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Pamela Isley (Poison Ivy)]], and [[Talia al Ghul]].\n\n;Catwoman\n{{main|Catwoman}}\n[[File:Adam Hughe's Catwoman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Catwoman]] is Batman's most enduring romance.<ref name=\"Love Interests\"/> Art by [[Adam Hughes]].]]\nWhile most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short in duration, [[Catwoman]] has been his most enduring romance throughout the years.<ref name=\"Love Interests\">{{Cite web | title = Batman's Top 10 Love Interests | work = MTV News | date = 2011-03-22 | accessdate = 2016-05-01 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410030145/http://www.mtv.com/news/2621111/batmans-top-10-love-interests/ | archivedate = 2016-04-10 }}</ref> The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.\n\nIn an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]''. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called \"[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]\", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.

Superman describes Batman as \"the most dangerous man on Earth\", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in ''JLA.''\n\nBatman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of [[telepathy]] and [[mind control]]. He is a master of [[disguise]], multilingual, and an expert in [[espionage]], often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and [[escapology]], which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.\n\nBatman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and his [[intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].\n\nAmong physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the [[Batplane]]), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.\n\nIn the comic, The Many Deaths of the Batman which focused on a former demolitions teacher of Batman who killed Batman's other teachers which included a race car driver, chemist, body builder, and gymnast all of whom were experts in their field.\n\n===Technology===\nBatman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the \"Batgyro\" in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32 (Sept., Oct. 1939).<ref name = \"vapzdg\"/>\n\n;Personal armor\n{{Main|Batsuit}}\nBatman's [[body armor]]ed costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.<ref name=\"A1\">Daniels (1999)</ref> The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.<ref name=\"A1\" /> Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey;<ref name=\"A1\" /> as well as black and grey. In the [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. [[Ben Affleck]]'s Batman in the [[DC Extended Universe]] films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.\n\nBatman's [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 98.</ref> The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, \"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same&nbsp;... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.\"<ref>Daniels (1999), pp. 159\u201360.</ref>\n\n;Batmobile\n{{main|Batmobile}}\n[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]\nBatman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the \"Batwing\"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper practice, the \"bat\" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]], among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline \"A Death in the Family\" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the \"bat\" prefix on his own. In ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Batman tells [[Carrie Kelley]] that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics [[The New 52|relaunched]] its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.\n\n;Utility belt\n{{main|Batman's utility belt}}\nBatman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are [[gun]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder.\n\n;Bat-Signal\n{{Main|Bat-Signal}}\nWhen Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.\n\nIn various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.\n\n;Batcave\n{{Main|Batcave}}\nThe Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]]. As his command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman's unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on. In both the comic ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #45 and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBatman's history has undergone many [[retroactive continuity]] revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character's history have varied greatly. Scholars [[William Uricchio]] and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, \"Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.\"<ref>''Batman Annual'' vol. 3, #2 (Jan. 2018)</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Origin====\n[[File:Thomas Wayne 1939.png|thumb|right|[[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] are shot by Joe Chill in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939). Art by Bob Kane.]]\nThe central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's [[origin story]].<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\" /> As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], murdered with a gun by a mugger named [[Joe Chill]]. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\",<ref name=\"pearson pg 186\">Pearson; Uricchio. \"'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'\" p. 186.</ref> a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.<ref name=\"pearson pg 191\">Pearson, p. 191.</ref>\n\n====Golden age====\n{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}\nIn Batman's first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Batman's origin is first presented in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939) and is later expanded upon in ''Batman'' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible&nbsp;...\" As if responding to his desires, a [[bat]] suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=Nov. 1939|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police.

Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the golden and silver ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.\n\nAfter the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the golden age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle. The two have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]], once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the golden age.<ref>One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Batman'' #1</ref> Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208, Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=Sept. 1956|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=Dec. 1955|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n\nBatman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the silver age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.\n\n====Bronze age====\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early golden age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the final issue of ''Brave and the Bold'' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team's leader until ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n\n====Modern age====\nAfter the 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline \"[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]\" from ''Batman'' #404\u2013407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Miller (comics)| author2 = [[David Mazzucchelli]] |author3=Richmond Lewis | title =[[Batman: Year One]] | publisher = DC Comics| year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-1-85286-077-6}}</ref> Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's silver-age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of golden-age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period.\n\nSubsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=457|date=Dec. 1990|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nMany of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.<ref>Dixon, Chuck. et al. \"Batman: Prodigal\".

New York: DC Comics, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe 1994 company-wide crossover storyline \"[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]\" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.\n\nBatman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's \"[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of \"Batman: Officer Down\" and \"Batman: War Games/War Crimes\"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in \"Officer Down\", while \"War Games\" and \"War Crimes\" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. [[Lex Luthor]] arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]\" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as \"Checkmate\" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #1\u20136.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====2000s====\nDC Comics' 2005 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he raped [[Sue Dibny]]. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.\n\nFollowing ''Infinite Crisis'', Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\".<ref>\"Infinite Crisis\" #7, p. 32</ref> In the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence.

However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, [[the New 52]], Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupted the publication of ''Batman, Incorporated'', which resumed its story in 2012\u20132013 with changes to suit the new status quo.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nBatman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world.

Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes; ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Who]] recorded the theme song from the ''Batman'' show for their 1966 EP [[Ready Steady Who]], and [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song on their 1967 album [[Live at Kelvin Hall]].\n\nThe popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';<ref>Boichel, p. 14.</ref> the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series; which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who also voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.\n\n[[File:Batmananimated32.png|thumb|left|upright|Batman as depicted in the award-winning 1990s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'']]\nIn 1992, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network; produced by [[Warner Bros.

The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious.\"<ref>Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pp. 189\u201390.<br/>For discussion of Wertham's impact see Brooker (2001).</ref> Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay \"Batman, Deviance, and Camp\" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because \"he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality\".<ref>Medhurst, Andy. \"Batman, Deviance, and Camp.\" ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-85170-276-6}}, p. 150.</ref> Professor of film and cultural studies [[Will Brooker]] argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.<ref>Brooker, Will (2001) ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'', Continuum. {{ISBN|978-1-62356-752-1}}, pp. 101 ff.</ref>\n\nCreators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, \"The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay&nbsp;... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane&nbsp;... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | title=Is Batman Gay? | accessdate=December 28, 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201072032/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | archivedate=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he's \"borderline pathological\", concluding \"He'd be much healthier if he ''were'' gay.\"<ref>Sharrett, p. 38.</ref> [[Grant Morrison]] said that \"Gayness is built into Batman&nbsp;... Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it.

This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our \"shadow selves\".<ref name=\"Langley\">Langley, Travis.

The Red Sox compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East]] division. The Red Sox have won nine [[World Series]] [[List of World Series champions|championships]] and have played in 13, most recently in [[2018 World Series|2018]]. In addition, they won the {{mlby|1904}} American League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], but were not able to defend their [[1903 World Series]] championship when the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] refused to participate in the [[1904 World Series]]. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since 1912. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I. Taylor]], ''circa'' 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"[[Boston Red Stockings (disambiguation)|Boston Red Stockings]]\", including the forerunner of the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nBoston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in [[1903 World Series|1903]] and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, dubbed the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival [[New York Yankees]] two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in {{wsy|2004}}. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s \"[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|mad dash]]\" in {{wsy|1946}}, the \"[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]\" of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}. Following their victory in the [[2018 World Series]], they became the first team to win four [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|World Series trophies]] in the 21st century, including championships in {{wsy|2004}}, {{wsy|2007}}, {{wsy|2013}} and {{wsy|2018}}.

The official Spanish site uses the variant \"Los Red Sox\".{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Red Stockings nickname was first used by a baseball team by the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]], who were members of the pioneering [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]]<ref>From George V. Tuohey (1897). A History of the Boston Baseball Club: A concise and accurate history of Base Ball from its inception. Boston, Massachusetts: M. F. Quinn & Co. p. 64.</ref> to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the \"Red Stockings\" nickname along (Most nicknames were then only nicknames, neither club names nor registered trademarks, so the migration was informal). The [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.\n\nWhen a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, the \"Red Stockings\" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the \"Red Caps\". Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname \"Braves\" in 1912; the club [[Boston Braves To Milwaukee|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In 1901, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \"Boston\", \"Bostonians\" or \"the Bostons\"; or the \"Americans\" or \"Boston Americans\" as in \"American Leaguers\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901\u20131907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read \"Boston\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \"B\" and \"A\" denoting \"Boston\" and \"American.\" Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including \"Somersets\" (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), \"Plymouth Rocks\", \"Beaneaters\", the \"Collinsites\" (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])\", and \"Pilgrims.\"\n\nFor years many sources have listed \"Pilgrims\" as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's follow-up article in ''The National Pastime''. Apparently this originated with a writer for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.]</ref> The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled \"The Pilgrims At Home\" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (\"Rory O'More\" melody).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm |title=The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist |publisher=Celebrateboston.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims \"sounded too much like homeless wanderers.\"\n\nThe National League club in Boston, though seldom called the \"Red Stockings\" anymore, still wore red trim. In 1907, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and remained the \"Red Sox\" for good.\n\nThe name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to \"Bosox\" or \"BoSox\", a combination of \"Boston\" and \"Sox\" (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|\"ChiSox\"]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Pawtucket Red Sox|\"PawSox\"]] of Pawtucket). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the ''Crimson Hose''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516201342/http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 16, 2016|title=Colin McEnroe at the Hartford Courant}}</ref> and ''the Olde Towne Team''.

Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname \"Americans\". This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which did not adopt an official nickname until 1908.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans logo.png|thumb|170px|The Americans logo, 1901\u201307]]\nThe upstart league placed franchises in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he needed a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, [[George Brumder]] who sold the team one year later.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Milwaukee Sentinel |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cdcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FxIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6397%2C3613025 |website=news.google.com}}</ref> Playing their home games at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star [[third baseman]] [[Jimmy Collins]], outfielders [[Chick Stahl]], [[Buck Freeman]], and [[Patsy Dougherty]], and [[pitcher]] [[Cy Young]], who in 1901 won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 wins), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml|title=Cy Young Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|author=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> His 1901 to 1904 seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.\n\nIn 1903, [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston]] participated in the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], going up against the [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6\u00bd games. Aided by the modified chants of \"[[Tessie]]\" by the [[Royal Rooters]] [[fan club]] and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.\n\n[[File:WorldSeries1903-640.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of the Huntington Avenue Grounds before the first modern World Series game]]\nThe [[1904 Boston Americans season|1904 club]] was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the [[1904 New York Highlanders season|New York Highlanders]], the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for [[Bob Unglaub]]. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, [[Hilltop Park]]. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With [[Jack Chesbro]], the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2\u20132 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and [[Lou Criger]] scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.\n\n[[File:Huntington Avenue Grounds.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Huntington Avenue Grounds during a game. Note building from which the famous 1903 \"bird's-eye\" photo was taken.]]\nThe NL champion [[1904 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] declined to play any [[1904 World Series|postseason series]], fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905. These successful times soon ended, however, as [[1906 Boston Americans season|Boston]] lost 100 games in 1906. However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans season pass, 1906.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A season pass for the 1906 season.]]\nBy 1909, [[center fielder]] [[Tris Speaker]] had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox did not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 [[1912 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Their .691 [[winning percentage]] in 1912 still stands as the best in team history, and their 105 wins stood as the club record for 106-years, until the 2018 club won 108. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game\u2014Tris Speaker, [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]]\u2014and superstar pitcher [[Smoky Joe Wood]], the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4\u20133\u20131 in the classic [[1912 World Series]] best known for [[Snodgrass's Muff]]. From 1913 to 1916 the Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]], who signed [[Babe Ruth]], soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in 1915 propelled the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] to the [[1915 World Series]], where they beat the [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] four games to one. Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The [[1916 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] went on to win the [[1916 World Series]], this time defeating the [[Brooklyn Robins]]. In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another [[1918 World Series|World Series]] championship, this time over the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].\n\n===Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920\u201338)===\n[[File:1915 Babe Ruth.jpeg|thumb|right|Babe Ruth in 1915]]\n[[Harry Frazee]] bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder [[Duffy Lewis]], pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/l/leonadu01.shtml|title=Dutch Leonard Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>), and pitcher [[Ernie Shore]] were traded to the Yankees for pitcher [[Ray Caldwell]], [[Slim Love]], [[Roxy Walters]], [[Frank Gilhooley]] and $15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lewis_Duffy.stm |title=Duffy Lewis |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> As all three players were well regarded in Boston\u2014Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average\u2014this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star [[Carl Mays]] was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/M/Mays_Carl.stm |title=Carl Mays |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Mays had several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.\n\nOn December 26, 1919,<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=31}}</ref> Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_leagues.shtml |title=Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records for Home Runs \u2014 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref>) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] play ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Montville|first=Leigh|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |pages=161\u201364|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}</ref> ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919. ''My Lady Friends'' had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.\n\nDuring that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] had a d\u00e9tente; they were called \"Insurrectos\" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920). Further, providing the Yankees with a [[box office]] attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and \"the Loyal Five\" clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0718/1407265.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB \u2014 When the Yankees nearly moved to Boston |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.\n\nNew York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry]], considered the \"Greatest Rivalry on Earth\" by American sports journalists.<ref name=\"FierceRivalry\"/>\n\n[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old07.png|thumb|125px|The Boston Red Sox logo (1931\u20131932)]]\nAfter deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, [[Wally Schang]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]] and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for [[Del Pratt]], [[Muddy Ruel]], John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Schang_Wally.stm |title=Wally Schang&#124;BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> The [[1921 in baseball|following winter]], iron man [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]], and pitchers [[Bullet Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones]] were traded to the Yankees for [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] (who was immediately shipped to the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]), [[Jack Quinn (baseball)|Jack Quinn]], [[Rip Collins (pitcher)|Rip Collins]], Bill Piercy and $50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Scott_Everett.stm |title=Everett Scott &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> On July 23, 1922, [[Joe Dugan]] and [[Elmer Smith (baseball outfielder, born 1892)|Elmer Smith]] were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, [[Johnny Mitchell (baseball)|Johnny Mitchell]], and [[Lefty O'Doul]], who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]] in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Smith_Elmer309.stm |title=Elmer Smith &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of [[Herb Pennock]], occurring in early 1923.

During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] in 1923. During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43-111, still the worst record in franchise history. One of the few bright spots on these teams was [[Earl Webb]], who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67. The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when [[Tom Yawkey]] bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher [[Wes Ferrell]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, [[Lefty Grove]], making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired [[Joe Cronin]], an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging [[first baseman]] [[Jimmie Foxx]] whose 50 home runs in 1938 stood as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/foxxji01.shtml|title=Jimmie Foxx Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com |author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131960: The Ted Williams Era===\n[[File:Ted Williams 1954 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ted Williams]]\nIn 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] [[Ted Williams]] from the minor league [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the \"Ted Sox.\" Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called \"Williamsburg.\" Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both World War II and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml |title=Ted Williams Statistics \u2014 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them \"The Knights of the Keyboard\", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.\n\nWith Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]], but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the \"Williams Shift\", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.\n\nThe Cardinals won the 1946 Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or \"held the ball\" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.\n\nAlong with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).\n\nThe Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In 1949, the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.\n\n[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old09.png|thumb|150px|Logo used by the Boston Red Sox in the 1950s]]The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup \"Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.\" [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, [[Frank Malzone]] debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the 1960 [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story \"Hub fans bid Kid adieu.\" The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm team]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s: Yaz and the Impossible Dream===\n{{Main article|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}\n<!--No Source Information: [[File:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]]-->\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.\n\nRed Sox fans know 1967 as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the \"Impossible Dream.\" The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] \"[[Man of La Mancha]]\". 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the 1966 [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the [[1967 World Series]].  Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 [[runs batted in]]. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[C\u00e9sar Tovar]] first on his ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> But the Red Sox lost the series the to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.

He was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.\n\n===1970s: The Red Hat Era===\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.\n\n====1975====\n\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill \"The Spaceman\" Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Awards & Rolaids Relief Award Winners \u2014 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"oezowb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml |title=Most Valuable Player MVP Awards & Cy Young Awards Winners \u2013 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].\n\nIn the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the eleventh inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled off [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.\n\nThe Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\"\n\n====1978 pennant race====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were {{frac|14|1|2}} [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as \"The Boston Massacre\"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.\n\nOn September 16 the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.\n\nThe most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=145\u2013147}}</ref> The dejected Boston manager, [[Don Zimmer]], gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: \"Bucky F**king Dent!\" [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third.

The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|work= }}</ref> to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in 1971.<ref name=\"oezowb\" /> Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander [[Bruce Hurst]] went 13-8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] from the 1960s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\nThe [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6\u20135. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.\n\nThe Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN.com: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3\u20133. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].\n\nAfter recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and [[Bruce Hurst]] as Most Valuable Player of the World Series. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.\n\n\nWhile Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.\n\nMany observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were \"cursed.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref>\n\nThis World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.<ref name=\"Gorman\"/> Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.<ref name=\"Gorman\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html|title=Lou Gorman, Whose Red Sox Lost to Mets, Dies at 82|date=April 2, 2011|first=Bruce|last=Weber|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B8}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Morgan Magic===\nThe [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in 1988.

The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland.

Prior to the start of the 1998 [[1998 Major League Baseball season|season]], the Red Sox dealt pitchers [[Tony Armas, Jr.]] and [[Carl Pavano]] to the [[Montreal Expos]] for pitcher [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]]. Mart\u00ednez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|team]] won the American League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]], but again lost the [[1998 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] to the [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]].\n\nIn 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park \"economically obsolete\" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.\n\nOn the field, the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|1999 Red Sox]] were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] took a 2\u20130 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and his brother [[Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez]]. Game 4's 23\u20137 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5\u20132 lead after two innings, but Pedro Mart\u00ednez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12\u20138 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder [[Troy O'Leary]]. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.\n\n===2002\u2013present: John Henry era===\n====2002\u201303====\n{{Main article|2002 Boston Red Sox season|2003 Boston Red Sox season}}\nIn 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to [[New England Sports Ventures]], a consortium headed by principal owner [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]]. [[Tom Werner]] served as executive chairman, [[Larry Lucchino]] served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was [[Les Otten]]. [[Dan Duquette]] was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM [[Mike Port]] taking the helm for the 2002 season. A week later, manager [[Joe Kerrigan]] was fired and was replaced by [[Grady Little]].\n\nWhile nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]], the new ownership made additions such as outfielder [[Cliff Floyd]] and relief pitcher [[Alan Embree]]. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ram\u00edrez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Mart\u00ednez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games\u2014becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.\n\nAfter failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by [[Yale University]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]]. Epstein, raised in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.\n\n[[File:2003-09-25 - Fenway Park 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Sox celebrate their clinching of the 2003 AL Wild Card with a victory over the [[2003 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]]]]\nThe [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|2003 team]] was known as the \"Cowboy Up\" team, a nickname derived from first baseman [[Kevin Millar]]'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.<ref name=\"Cowboyup\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/09/24/rallying_cry_spurs_sox_to_finish_ride/|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 24, 2003|title=Rallying Cry Spurs Sox To Finish Ride|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}</ref> In the [[2003 American League Division Series]], the Red Sox rallied from a 0\u20132 series deficit against the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] to win the best-of-five series.

In Game 7, Boston led 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Mart\u00ednez allowed three runs to tie the game.

Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] manager [[Terry Francona]].\n\n====\"The Idiots\": 2004 World Series Championship====\n{{Main article|2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 World Series}}\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], and received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]], and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as \"the Idiots\", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed \"curse.\"\n\nBoston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19-8 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with [[Mariano Rivera]] in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by [[Bill Mueller]], sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game 6-4 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning. The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series deciding Game 7 after trailing 3-0 in games. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10\u20133 victory over the Yankees. Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer. Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American professional sports]] teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3\u20130. (The [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Los Angeles Kings]] would later accomplish the feat).\n\nThe Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; [[Mark Bellhorn]] hit a game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]] in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and [[Derek Lowe]]. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ram\u00edrez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[October 2004 lunar eclipse|total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].\n\n====2007: World Series Championship====\n{{Main article|2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007 World Series}}\n[[File:Redsoxpitchers.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pitchers (left\u2013right) [[Josh Beckett]], Jon Lester, [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]], pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]] and [[Curt Schilling]], prior to a Red Sox game at Seattle in August 2007]]\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]\nThe 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs. In 2006 [[David Ortiz]] broke [[Jimmie Foxx]]'s single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to several injuries in club's roster. \n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.\n\nThe Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager [[Terry Francona]] refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|AL Rookie of the Year Award]] for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, [[Josh Beckett]] emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]] all struggled at times. Relief pitcher [[Hideki Okajima]], another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a [[no-hitter]] in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.\n\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Victorious Red Sox players being honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W.

Facing the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30\u20135 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]], and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered [[Jon Lester]], who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5\u2154 shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] and pinch-hitter [[Bobby Kielty]] secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.\n\n====2008\u20132012: Injuries and Collapses====\nThe Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7\u20130. Down the stretch, outfielder [[Manny Ramirez]] became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. The Red Sox defeated the [[2008 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]] three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

In 2010 they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs. In 2011 the [[2011_Boston_Red_Sox_season#Collapse|Red Sox collapsed]], becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, as they went 7-20 in the final month and failed again to make the playoffs. In December 2011, [[Bobby Valentine]] was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of [[Fenway Park]], and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. They finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.\n\n[[File:Massachusetts State House Red Sox Banner.JPG|thumb|The [[Massachusetts State House]] displaying a banner in honor of the Red Sox's [[2013 World Series]] appearance]]\n\n====Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions====\n{{main article|2013 Boston Red Sox season|2013 World Series}}\nBoston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69\u201393 record in 2012\u201326 games behind the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L.

These acquisitions included veteran catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Mike Napoli]], and [[Shane Victorino]]. While some questioned these players as \"re-treads\", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in \"clubhouse players\". Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran [[John Lackey]] coming off [[Tommy John surgery]] and both Jon Lester and [[Clay Buchholz]] returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both [[closer (baseball)|closers]], [[Joel Hanrahan]] and [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]], went down early with season-ending injuries.

The team also hung up in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] a custom jersey that read \"Boston Strong\" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's [[area code]].

In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14) followed by Robinson's 42.

As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], as the '''Milwaukee Brewers''' (not related to the second current Brewers franchise there) before moving to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to become the '''[[St. Louis Browns]]'''. After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist [[Clarence Miles]] and Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]] The team's current majority owner is lawyer [[Peter Angelos]].\n\nThe Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the [[Baltimore oriole|official state bird of Maryland]]; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including another AL charter member franchise also named the \"[[History of the New York Yankees|Baltimore Orioles]],\" which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the [[New York Yankees]]. [[List of baseball nicknames|Nicknames]] for the team include the  '''\"O's\"''' and the '''\"Birds\"'''.\n\nThe Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983, when they made six [[World Series]] appearances, winning three of them ([[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1983 World Series|1983]]). This era of the club featured several future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], outfielder [[Frank Robinson]], starting pitcher [[Jim Palmer]], first baseman [[Eddie Murray]], shortstop [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], and manager [[Earl Weaver]]. The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships (1969\u20131971, 1973\u20131974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six [[American League Championship Series|pennants]] (1966, 1969\u20131971, 1979, 1983), and three [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] berths (1996, 2012, 2016). \n\nAfter suffering a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager [[Buck Showalter]] and general manager [[Dan Duquette]], including a division title and advancement to the [[American League Championship Series]] for the first time in 17 years in [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014]]. However, the [[2018 Baltimore Orioles season|2018]] team finished with a franchise-worst record of 47-115, prompting the team to move on from Showalter and Duquette following the season\u2019s conclusion.\n\nThe Orioles are also well-known for their influential [[ballpark]], [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], which opened in 1992 in [[downtown Baltimore]].<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-camden-yards-wrigley-field-spt-0504-20170503-story.html Camden Yards paved a retro revolution \u2014 and influenced Wrigley Field's renovations - Chicago Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.citypaper.com/news/features/bcp-040517-feature-a-more-complex-legacy-oriole-park-25th-anniversary-html-htmlstory.html A More Complex Legacy: Oriole Park is known as \u201cthe ballpark that forever changed baseball,\u201d and its impact may well extend to local governing - Baltimore City Paper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Baltimore Orioles}}\nThe modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the [[Minor League Baseball|minor]] [[Western League (original)|Western League]], beginning in 1894, when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] in 1900.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nAt the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the [[1901 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] 14\u201313 after blowing a nine-run lead in the 9th inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1901/04251901.htm |title=Events of Thursday, April 25, 1901 |publisher=Retrosheet.org |date=April 25, 1902 |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref> To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseballs-biggest-ninth-inning-comebacks-385/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Baseball's Biggest Ninth-Inning Comebacks | first=Carl | last=Bialik | date=July 28, 2008}}</ref> During the first American League season in 1901, they finished last (eighth place) with a record of 48\u201389. Its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.\n\n===St. Louis Browns===\n{{main|History of the St. Louis Browns}}\nAfter one year in Milwaukee the club relocated to St Louis, and for a while enjoyed some success, especially in the 1920s behind Hall of Fame first baseman [[George Sisler]].  However, the team's fortunes declined from then on, as playing success and gate receipts instead went increasingly to the Browns' own tenants at [[Sportsman's Park]], the National League [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]].  During this period the Browns only won one pennant, in the 1944 season stocked with wartime replacement players, and lost to the Cardinals in the third and last World Series ever played entirely in one ballpark.  In 1953, with the Browns unable to afford even stadium upkeep, owner Bill Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cards and attempted to move the club back to Milwaukee, but this was vetoed by the other Major League owners.  Instead, Veeck sold his franchise to a partnership of Baltimore businessmen.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\n[[File:Orioles Mascot.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Oriole Bird\", which has been the official mascot figure since April 6, 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oriole Bird|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/bal/fan_forum/oriolebird.jsp|publisher=Baltimore Orioles|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Miles-Krieger ([[Gunther Brewing Company]])-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles soon after taking control of the franchise. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by a [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|National League team]] in the 1890s. In 1901, Baltimore and John McGraw <ref>{{cite web|title=John McGraw|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGraw\n}}</ref>]] were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing American League, naming the team the Orioles. After a battle with Ban Johnson, the Head of the American League in 1902, McGraw took many of the top players including Walter Scott \"Steve\" Brodie, Dan McGann, Roger Bresnahan, and Joe McGinnity to the New York Giants.  As an affront to Johnson, McGraw kept the black and orange colors of the New York Giants, which San Francisco wears to this day. In 1903, the franchise -- the remaining players, assets and debts, the corporation -- was transferred to New York where they were nicknamed the Highlanders until circa 1912, by which time Yanks or Yankees had taken over as their popular moniker.  As a member of the high-minor league level [[International League]], the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Orioles]] competed at what is now known as the AAA level from 1903 to 1953; the IL Orioles' most famous player was a local Baltimore product, hard-hitting left-handed pitcher [[Babe Ruth]]. When Oriole Park burned down in 1944, the team moved to a temporary home, [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]], where they won the Junior World Series. Their large postseason crowds caught the attention of the major leagues, eventually leading to a new MLB franchise in Baltimore.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Baseball in Baltimore|last=Flynn|first=Tom|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9780738553252|location=Maryland|page=67|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5iTozrMruwC&lpg=PP1&dq=baseball%20in%20baltimore&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=baseball%20in%20baltimore&f=false}}</ref>\n\n====Seeds of success (1954\u20131959)====\nAfter starting the [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954 campaign]] with a two-game split against the [[1954 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] returned to Baltimore on April 15 to a welcoming parade that wound through the streets of [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown]], with an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the route. In its first-ever home opener at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] later in the afternoon, they treated a sellout crowd of 46,354 to a 3\u20131 victory over the [[1954 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. The remainder of the season would not be as pleasant, with the team enduring 100 losses while avoiding the AL cellar by only three games. With fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the franchise's business operations and dissatisfied with yet another seventh-place finish, Clarence Miles resigned in early November 1955. Real estate developer [[James Keelty|James Keelty Jr.]] succeeded him as president with investment banker [[Joseph Iglehart]] the new board chairman.\n\nThe seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] to become the ballclub's manager and general manager. He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the '''''Oriole Way'''''. The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization. Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level.\n\nFor the remainder of the 1950s, the Orioles crawled up the standings, reaching as high as fifth place with a [[1957 Baltimore Orioles season|76\u201376]] record in 1957. Richards succeeded in stocking the franchise with a plethora of young talent which included [[Dave Nicholson]], [[Pete Ward]], [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] (1960 AL [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]]), [[Milt Pappas]], [[Jerry Adair]], [[Steve Barber]] (20 wins in 1963), [[Boog Powell]], [[Dave McNally]], and [[Brooks Robinson]]. Unfortunately, Richards also had the tendency to recklessly spend money on individuals with dubious baseball skills. This became a major problem as bidding wars between the ballclubs to land the best amateur players escalated signing bonuses.\n\nThe solution came on November 5, 1958, when [[Lee MacPhail]] was appointed general manager, allowing Richards to focus on his managerial duties. MacPhail added much-needed discipline to the [[scout (sport)|scouting]] staff by establishing cross-checkers who thoroughly evaluated young hopefuls to determine whether they were worthy of being tendered a contract. He also accepted the title of president after Keelty resigned in mid-December 1959.\n\n====Pennant contenders (1960\u20131965)====\nOne month prior to the end of the 1961 season, Richards resigned as the team's skipper to become the general manager of the expansion [[Houston Colt .45s]]. A [[1960 Major League Baseball season|year earlier]], he succeeded in establishing the [[1960 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] as a legitimate contender when they stood atop the AL standings as late as early September before finishing in second place at 89\u201365.\n\nIn 1964, the [[1964 Baltimore Orioles season|Birds]], piloted by [[Hank Bauer]] in his first year of managing the ballclub, were involved in a tight pennant race against the [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[1964 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]]. They ended up in third place with a 97\u201365 record, only two games out. It has been suggested that they would likely have advanced to the [[1964 World Series|Fall Classic]] had it not been for a minor wrist injury that sidelined Powell for two weeks in late August.<ref>Halberstam, David. ''October 1964''. New York: Villard Books, 1994.</ref> Nevertheless, Robinson enjoyed a breakout season with a league-high 118 RBIs, and won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|AL Most Valuable Player Award]].\n\nThe television/radio network of [[CBS]]' purchase of a majority stake in the Yankees on September 9 of that same year resulted in a change to the ownership situation in Baltimore. Iglehart, the Orioles' largest shareholder at 32% and owner of a sizable amount of CBS stock, straightened out his conflict of interest issues on May 25, 1965, by selling his 64,000 shares in the ball-club to the [[National Bohemian|National Brewing Company]], an original team investor which finally had controlling interest at 65%. Brewery president [[Jerold Hoffberger]] became the Orioles' new chairman of the board. Hoffberger's first action was installing [[Frank Cashen]], the Director of Advertising for the National Brewery, as Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer for the Orioles.\n\nWith the benefit of a deep talent pool and superior scouts, the franchise continued to make improvements at the major league level. Three months before the start of the 1963 season, the [[1963 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] stabilized its infield by acquiring [[Luis Aparicio]] in a transaction that involved sending a trio of homegrown players (Hansen, Nicholson and Ward) to the White Sox. They also scoured the minor leagues for selections in the [[Rule 5 draft]] ([[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]] from the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in 1962, [[Moe Drabowsky]] from the Cardinals in 1965) and claims off waivers ([[Curt Blefary]], 1965 [[AL Rookie of the Year]], from the Yankees in 1963).\n\n====Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson====\n[[File:Antonio Tobias Mendez.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Robinson]] statue by [[Antonio Tobias Mendez]].]]\nOn December 9, 1965, the Orioles traded pitcher [[Milt Pappas]] (and several others) to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Frank Robinson]]. The following year, Robinson won the [[American League Most Valuable Player]] award, thus becoming the first (and so far only) man to win the MVP in each league (Robinson won the NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). In addition to winning the 1966 MVP, Robinson also won the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] (leading the American League in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in), a feat also achieved the following season by [[1962 Boston Red Sox season|Boston's]] [[Carl Yastrzemski]]. The [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won their first-ever American League championship in 1966, and in a major upset, swept the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by out-dueling the defending World Champion [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], whose pitching staff was led by aces [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]]. The only home run ball ever hit completely out of Memorial Stadium was slugged by Robinson on Mother's Day in 1966, off [[1966 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Luis Tiant]]. It cleared the left field single-deck portion of the grandstand. A flag was later erected near the spot the ball cleared the back wall, with simply the word \"HERE\" upon it. The flag is now in the Baltimore Orioles Museum.\n\nPappas went 30\u201329 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1971 and 1972, including a no-hitter in the latter season, this did not help the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]], who ended up losing the [[1970 World Series]] to Robinson and the Orioles. This trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by [[Susan Sarandon]] in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]'': \"Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?\"<ref>''Bull Durham''. Dir. Ron Shelton. Perf. Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon. Orion Pictures, 1988. Film.</ref>\n\n====Glory years (1966\u20131983)====\nIn the 1960s, the Orioles farm system produced an especially large number of high-quality players and coaches and laid the foundation for two decades of on-field success. This period included eighteen consecutive winning seasons (1968\u20131985) -- a run of success that saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.\n\nDuring this period, the Orioles played baseball the \"Oriole Way\", an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken Sr.]]'s phrase \"perfect practice makes perfect!\" The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce \"replacement parts\" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. Elaborations on the Oriole way include pitching coach and manager Ray Miller's maxim \"Work fast, change speeds, and throw strikes\" and manager Earl Weaver's maxim \"Pitching, defense and three-run homers.\"\n\"\nThe \"Oriole Way\" began flourishing in 1966 after the Robinson-for-Pappas deal, as Robinson won the \"Triple Crown Award\". His Orioles would easily sweep the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1966 World Series]]. After a mediocre [[1967 Baltimore Orioles season|1967 season]], [[Hank Bauer]] would be replaced by [[Earl Weaver]] halfway into 1968. The [[1968 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would finish second in the American League. This would only be a prelude to 1969, when the [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 109&nbsp;games and easily won the newly created [[American League East]] division title. [[Mike Cuellar]] shared the [[Cy Young Award]] with Detroit's [[Denny McLain]]. After sweeping [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota]] in the [[1969 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], Baltimore was shocked by losing to the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in a five-game [[1969 World Series|World Series]]. The next year, [[Boog Powell]] won the MVP and the Orioles won another 108&nbsp;games. After sweeping the [[1970 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] once again in the [[1970 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles won the [[1970 World Series]] by defeating the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]' [[Big Red Machine]] in five games.\n\nIn 1971, the [[1971 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won another division title thanks to four 20-game winners on their pitching staff (Cuellar, [[Jim Palmer]], [[Pat Dobson]], and [[Dave McNally]]). After defeating the young [[1971 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[1971 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles would lose a heartbreaking seven-game [[1971 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1971 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The [[1972 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would miss the playoffs in 1972, but rebounded to win the division in 1973 and 1974. Each time, they would lose to Oakland in the ALCS. During this stretch, the Orioles began to phase out their veteran infield by replacing [[Davey Johnson]] and [[Brooks Robinson]] with younger stars [[Bobby Grich]] and [[Doug DeCinces]], respectively. Johnson would be dealt along with [[Johnny Oates]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for catcher and 1971 [[National League Rookie of the Year]] [[Earl Williams (1970s catcher)|Earl Williams]]. Although Williams had hit 63 home runs in two seasons with Atlanta, he would only hit 36 homers in two seasons with the Orioles.\n\nIn 1975, the Birds acquired slugger [[Lee May]] in a trade with Houston, and traded [[Dave McNally]], [[Rich Coggins]] and minor-league pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] for star outfielder [[Ken Singleton]], and future 20-game winner [[Mike Torrez]]. Jim Palmer won the Cy Young Award, but the [[1975 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] lost the division title to the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] and their mega-rookies [[Fred Lynn]] and [[Jim Rice]]. The 1976 season brought [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Ken Holtzman]] from a trade with Oakland, but the [[1976 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] only won 88&nbsp;games. It was this season when the Orioles made a trade that brought them players such as [[Tippy Martinez]] and [[Rick Dempsey]]. This young foundation, along with the departures of the unhappy Jackson and Holtzman, would create the basis for 1977. The [[1977 Baltimore Orioles season|\"No Name Orioles\"]], along with Rookie of the Year [[Eddie Murray]], won 97&nbsp;games and finished tied for second place with [[1977 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]]. After finishing fourth in 1978, the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] finally won the division in 1979 thanks to strong play from Ken Singleton and Cy Young winner [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]]. The Orioles defeated the [[1979 California Angels season|Angels]] in the [[1979 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], but lost to [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh]] in another [[1979 World Series|stunning World Series]]. This started a short period of heartbreak for Baltimore that would nevertheless culminate in a championship.\n\n[[File:Steve Stone interviews Mike Mullen CROP.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]]]]\nThe [[1980 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 100&nbsp;games in 1980 thanks to Cy Young winner [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] who went 25\u20137 (.781) while leading the league in wins (a franchise record) and win-loss percentage, but the [[1980 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] won 103&nbsp;games. Although [[1981 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]] had the best overall record in the AL East in 1981, they finished second in each half. As a result, they were out of the playoffs due to the postseason structure that year because of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]. The 1982 campaign saw Baltimore eliminated on the final weekend of the season by the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. In an unforgettable scene, despite the season-ending loss eliminating them from the playoffs, fans stayed to honor the retiring [[Earl Weaver]], who would be succeeded by [[Joe Altobelli]]. In 1983, Altobelli would lead the Orioles to 98 wins and a division title thanks to MVP [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. The [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] defeated the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] thanks to a 10th-inning homer by [[Tito Landrum]] in the deciding game. The Orioles won the [[1983 World Series|World Series]] in five games by defeating the [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]].\n\nDuring their most productive years and only World Series championships thus far, the Orioles saw three of its players named MVP: Frank Robinson in 1966; Boog Powell in 1970; and Cal Ripken Jr. in 1983. Additionally, Brooks Robinson was named Most Valuable Player in 1964, just two years before the 1966\u20131983 golden era began. The pitching staff was phenomenal, with four pitchers winning six [[Cy Young Award]]s (Mike Cuellar in 1969; Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976; Mike Flanagan in 1979; and Steve Stone in 1980). In 1971, the team's four starting pitchers, McNally, Cuellar, Palmer, and Pat Dobson, all won 20&nbsp;games, a feat that has not been replicated. In that year, the Birds went on to post a 101\u201361 record for their third-straight AL East title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/baltios/orioles.html |title=Baltimore Orioles (1954-Present) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref> Also during this stretch three players were named [[American League Rookie of the Year|rookies of the year]]: [[Al Bumbry]] (1973); Eddie Murray (1977); and Cal Ripken Jr. (1982). One might date the glory years of the Orioles dating back to 1964, which would include two third-place seasons, 1964\u201365, in which the Orioles won 97 and 94&nbsp;games, respectively, and a year in which third-baseman Brooks Robinson won his [[Most Valuable Player Award]] (1964). The glory years of the Orioles effectively ended when the [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], a divisional rival at the time, went 35\u20135 to open the 1984 season on the way to winning the World Series, in which Hall-of-Fame pitcher Jim Palmer retired during the 1984 season.\n\n====Final seasons at Memorial Stadium (1984\u20131991)====\n[[Image:Baltimore Memorial Stadium 1991.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Orioles hosting one of the final games at Memorial Stadium in 1991.]]\nAfter winning the [[1983 World Series]], the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing 1986 in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore. The [[1988 Baltimore Orioles season|team]] hit bottom in 1988 when it started the season 0\u201321, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the majors that year. The \"Why Not?\" Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] overtook them and seized the AL East title on the final weekend of the regular season. The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken Jr. winning his second [[AL MVP Award]] in 1991. The [[1991 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] said goodbye to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38&nbsp;years, at the end of the 1991 campaign.\n\n[[Image:Baltimore Orioles wordmark 1988 to 1994.png|thumb|left|150px|The Orioles wordmark (1988\u20131994)]]\n\n====Camden Yards opens (1992\u20131993)====\n{{main|1992 Baltimore Orioles season|1993 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nOpening to much fanfare in 1992, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was an instant success, spawning other retro-designed major league ballparks within the next two decades. The stadium became the site of the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]]. The Orioles returned to contention in those first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times.\n\n=====Angelos takes over=====\nAlso in 1993, with then-owner [[Eli Jacobs]] forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based attorney [[Peter Angelos]], along with the ownership syndicate he headed, was awarded the Orioles in [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]] in New York City, returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979.\n\n====Strike year (1994)====\n{{main|1994 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nAfter the 1993 season, the Orioles acquired first baseman [[Rafael Palmeiro]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. The Orioles, who spent all of 1994 chasing the [[1994 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]], which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season.\n\n====Ripken breaks the streak (1995)====\n[[File:2131 on the warehouse wall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The numbers on the Orioles' warehouse changed from 2130 to 2131 to celebrate Cal Ripken Jr. passing Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played streak.]]\n{{main|1995 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nThe labor impasse would continue into the spring of 1995. Almost all of the major league clubs held spring training using [[strikebreaker|replacement players]], with the intention of beginning the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|season]] with them. The Orioles, whose owner was a labor union lawyer, were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season. Had they fielded a substitute team, [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized. The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled.\n\nThe Ripken countdown resumed once the season began. Ripken finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130&nbsp;games in a nationally televised game on September 6. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999. Ripken finished his streak with 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998, the [[1998 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] final home game of the season against the [[1998 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] at Camden Yards.\n\nThe Orioles finished two games under .500 (71\u201373) in third place in [[Phil Regan (baseball)|Phil Regan]]'s only season of managing the ballclub.\n\n====Playoff years (1996\u20131997)====\n\n=====1996 season=====\n{{main|1996 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nBefore the 1996 season, Angelos hired [[Pat Gillick]] as general manager. Given the green light to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like [[B. J. Surhoff]], [[Randy Myers]], [[David Wells]] and [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under new manager [[Davey Johnson]] and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 home runs in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a 12-year absence by clinching the AL wild card berth. Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into home plate umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during an argument in Toronto. He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason. After dethroning the defending American League champion [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3\u20131 in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the Orioles fell to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] 4\u20131 in an [[1996 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] notable for right field umpire [[Rich Garcia]]'s failure to call fan interference in the first game of the series, when 12-year-old Yankee fan [[Jeffrey Maier]] reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play ball, which was scored as a home run for [[Derek Jeter]], tying the game at 4\u20134 in the eighth inning. Absent Maier's interference, it appeared as if the ball might have been off the wall or caught by right fielder [[Tony Tarasco]]. The Yankees went on to win the game in extra innings on an ensuing walk-off home run by Bernie Williams.\n\n=====1997 season=====\n{{main|1997 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nThe Orioles went \"wire-to-wire\" (first place from start to finish) in winning the AL East title in 1997. After eliminating the [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 3\u20131 in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] 4\u20132, with each Oriole loss by only a run. Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's fine for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's charity.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | work=The Washington Post|title=Poor Communication at Heart of Feud  | date=May 12, 1998}}</ref> Pitching coach [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] replaced Johnson.\n\n====Beginning of a downturn (1998\u20132001)====\n\n=====1998 season=====\n{{main|1998 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nWith Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed. Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving in free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]].\n\n=====1999 season=====\n{{main|1999 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\n[[File:Baltimore Orioles.svg|150px|right|thumb|Logo (1999\u20132008).]]In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an [[1999 Baltimore Orioles \u2013 Cuban national baseball team exhibition series|exhibition series]] against the [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuban national team]] in [[Havana]]. The Orioles won the game 3\u20132 in 11 innings. They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] faced the [[1959 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] in an exhibition. The Cuban team visited Baltimore in May 1999. Cuba won the second game 10\u20136.\n\n=====2000\u20132001 seasons=====\n{{main|2000 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nCal Ripken Jr. achieved his 3000th hit early in the season. A fire sale occurred late in the season, where the Orioles traded away many veterans for unproven young players and minor league prospects. The Orioles called up many of their AAA players to finish the season. The only acquired player that would have a long-term career with the organization was [[Melvin Mora]].\n\n{{main|2001 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nThis was Cal Ripken Jr.'s final season. His number (8) was retired in a ceremony before the final home game of the season.\n\n====Post-Ripken era and downfall (2002-2011)====\n\n=====2002-2004 seasons=====\n[[File:Baltimore Orioles Script.svg|right|thumb|This version of the script logo has been on the front of the home jerseys since 2004.]]\n{{main|2002 Baltimore Orioles season|2003 Baltimore Orioles season|2004 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nThe team\u2019s first year without Ripken saw the team with a record of 63-63 at the conclusion of play on August 23, but then proceed to lose 32 of its last 36 games of the season, including their final 12 in a row to finish the season 67-95. In an effort to right the Orioles' sinking ship, changes began to sweep through the organization in 2003. General manager [[Syd Thrift]] was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired [[Jim Beattie (baseball)|Jim Beattie]] as executive vice-president and [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] as the vice president of baseball operations. After another losing season, manager [[Mike Hargrove]] was not retained and Yankees coach [[Lee Mazzilli]] was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in SS [[Miguel Tejada]], C [[Javy L\u00f3pez]], and former Oriole 1B [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. The following season, the Orioles traded for OF [[Sammy Sosa]].\n\n=====2005 season=====\n[[File:CamdenYards 2005-05-08.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Orioles taking on the Kansas City Royals at home in 2005.]]\n{{main|2005 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nThe team got hot early in 2005 and jumped out in front of the AL East division, holding onto first place for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the Orioles started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]. Injuries to Lopez, Sosa, [[Luis Matos]], [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]], and [[Larry Bigbie]] came within weeks of each other, and the team grew increasingly dissatisfied with the \"band-aid\" moves of the front office and manager Mazzilli to help them through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick OF [[Jeff Fiorentino]] were brought up in place of more experienced players such as OF [[David Newhan]], who had batted .311 the previous season.\n\nAfter starting the season 42\u201328 (.600), the Orioles finished the season with a stretch of 32\u201360 (.348), ending at 74\u201388 (.457). Only the [[2005 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] (.346) had a worse winning percentage for the season than did the Orioles for the final 92&nbsp;games. The club's major off-season acquisition, [[Sammy Sosa]], posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him. The Orioles also allowed Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher [[Sidney Ponson]] was arrested for DUI, and on September 1, the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and released him. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration and was eventually resolved.\n\n=====2006 season=====\n{{main|2006 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nIn the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], the Orioles contributed more players than any other major league team, with eleven players suiting up for their home nations. [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]] and [[Adam Loewen]] pitched for [[Canada national baseball team|Canada]]; [[Rodrigo L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Rodrigo L\u00f3pez]] and [[Ger\u00f3nimo Gil]] (released before the season began by the club) played for [[Mexico national baseball team|Mexico]]; [[Daniel Cabrera]] and [[Miguel Tejada]] for the [[Dominican Republic national baseball team|Dominican Republic]]; [[Javy L\u00f3pez]] and [[Luis Matos]] for [[Puerto Rico national baseball team|Puerto Rico]]; [[Bruce Chen]] for [[Panama national baseball team|Panama]]; [[Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez]] for [[Venezuela national baseball team|Venezuela]]; and [[John Stephens (baseball)|John Stephens]] for [[Australia national baseball team|Australia]]. The Orioles finished the 2006 season with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses, 27&nbsp;games behind the AL East-leading [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].\n\n=====2007 season=====\n{{main|2007 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nOn June 18, the Orioles fired [[Sam Perlozzo]] after losing eight straight games. He was replaced on interim basis by [[Dave Trembley]]. On June 22, Miguel Tejada's consecutive-games streak came to an end due to an injury, the fifth-longest streak in major league history. [[Aubrey Huff]] became the first Oriole to hit for the cycle at home, on June 29 against the Angels. On July 7, [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]] struck out 15 batters in a game against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] to tie a franchise record held by [[Mike Mussina]]. On July 31, 2007, [[Andy MacPhail]] named Dave Trembley as the Orioles manager through the remainder of the 2007 season, and advised him to \"Keep up the good work.\"<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-orioles-perlozzo&prov=ap&type=lgns ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005005307/https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-orioles-perlozzo&prov=ap&type=lgns |date=October 5, 2007 }}</ref> Facing the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in a doubleheader at Camden Yards on August 22, the Orioles surrendered 30 runs in the first game, a modern-era record for a single game, in a 30\u20133 defeat. The Orioles led the game 3\u20130 after three innings of play. Sixteen of Texas' thirty runs were scored in the final two innings. The Orioles would also fall in the nightcap, 9\u20137.\n\n=====2008 season=====\n{{main|2008 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nThe Orioles began the 2008 season in a rebuilding mode under President of Baseball Operations [[Andy MacPhail]]. The Orioles traded away star players [[Miguel Tejada]] to the [[Houston Astros|Astros]] and ace [[\u00c9rik B\u00e9dard]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for prized prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], lefty reliever [[George Sherrill]], and minor league pitchers [[Kam Mickolio]], [[Chris Tillman]], and Tony Butler. The Orioles started off the first couple weeks of the season near the top of their division as players such as [[Nick Markakis]] and newcomer [[Luke Scott]] led the team offensively. Although the Orioles hovered around .500 for much of the season, they had fallen back by September and were over 20&nbsp;games behind the first place [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]. They finished the season losing 11 of their final 12&nbsp;games and 28 of their final 34. The team finished last for the first time since their 1988 season.\n\nAfter the season ended, the Orioles showcased altered uniforms, with a circular 'Maryland' patch added to the left-hand sleeve of all jerseys and the grey road jerseys displaying \"Baltimore\" across the chest for the first time in a quarter-century; this reflected the arrival of the [[Washington Nationals]], because ever since the [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] had departed for Texas in 1972, the Orioles had claimed to represent the Baltimore-Washington metro area.\n\n=====2009 season=====\n{{main|2009 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n[[File:Nick Markakis.jpg|thumb|right|Adam Jones and Nick Markakis, Orioles v.

Playing for the Texas Rangers during the 2010 season, Guerrero had hit 29 home runs, with a .300 batting average. (His career batting average was .320 with 436 home runs.)\n\nThe Orioles 2011 record was 69\u201393, the 14th consecutive losing season for the franchise dating back to 1998. The highlight of the season was their final game on September 28, when they defeated the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] 4\u20133 thanks to 9th inning heroics by [[Nolan Reimold]] and [[Robert Andino]]. The Orioles victory prevented the Red Sox from earning the wild card berth as part of \"[[Game 162]]\", one of the most dramatic nights in Major League Baseball history. On November 8, the Orioles announced the hiring of [[Dan Duquette]] as the vice president of baseball operations (''de facto'' GM) in the hopes of turning the corner.\n\n====Return to success (2012\u20132017)====\n\n=====2012 season=====\n{{main|2012 Baltimore Orioles season}}\n\nThe Orioles finished the first half of the 2012 season with a winning record for only the second time since going wire to wire in 1997, with a record of 45\u201340 before the All-Star break. On May 6, the Orioles played a 17-inning game against the [[2012 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the first game since 1925 in which both teams used a position player as a pitcher. The Orioles won that game, and designated hitter [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] received the win. The Orioles won their 81st game on September 13, ending the streak of 14 straight years with a losing record, as well as ensuring that the team would spend the entire year with a record of .500 or higher. On September 16, they won their 82nd game, securing the first season with a winning record since 1997.\n\nOn September 21, closer [[Jim Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Jim Johnson]] earned his 46th save of the season, setting a new Orioles franchise record for saves by one pitcher in a single season. It was previously held by [[Randy Myers]], who had 45 saves in 1997. Johnson became the tenth player to record 50 saves in Major League history. He finished the regular season with 51 saves.\n\nWith the win against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on September 30 and the loss of the [[2012 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels]] to the [[2012 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in the second game of a doubleheader, the Orioles clinched a playoff berth. This season marked the Orioles return to postseason play.\n\nThe Orioles finished the regular season in second place in the AL East with a record of 93\u201369, reversing the 69\u201393 record from the previous year. Despite a poor run differential (+7, the lowest of all playoff teams in 2012), they benefited from a 29\u20139 record in games decided by one run and a 16\u20132 record in extra-inning games. They went on the road to face the team that finished first in the Wild Card race, the Texas Rangers for a [[2012 American League Wild Card Game|one-game playoff series]] on October 5, winning 5\u20131 to advance to the [[2012 American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the [[2012 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on October 7.\n\nThe season was also distinctive for the fact that Orioles became the only team in MLB history, since 1900, never to have lost a game due to an opponent's walk-off hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BAL/2012-schedule-scores.shtml|title=2012 Baltimore Orioles Schedule and Results|last=|first=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> Despite a regular season of avoiding walk-off losses, they lost in Game 3 of the ALDS when Yankee [[Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez]] hit his own record-setting, game-winning home run in the bottom of the 12th inning. The Orioles would lose the 2012 ALDS in five games.\n\n=====2013 season=====\n{{main|2013 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nDuring the home opener on April 5, first baseman [[Chris Davis (baseball)|Chris Davis]] set a new MLB record with 16 RBI's during the first four games of a season, as well as becoming the fourth player ever to hit home runs in the first four games, including a grand slam in the fourth. On September 13, Davis hit his 50th home run of the season, against the [[2013 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], tying [[Brady Anderson]] for the most home runs in Orioles history. Davis would break Anderson's record four days later against the [[2013 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. His 51st home run also tied Anderson's record of 92 extra-base hits in a single season, a record he would again break four days later. Davis would go on to finish the season with 53 home runs.\n\nOn September 18, the Orioles played their 114th errorless game of the season, setting a new MLB record for the most errorless games in one season since 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130919&content_id=61061100&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal |title=Orioles set errorless game record in victory |last=Mastrodonato |first=Jason |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref> They played 119&nbsp;games without an error, ending on September 27.\n\nOn September 20, the Orioles played the [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in an 18 inning game that lasted 6&nbsp;hours, 54&nbsp;minutes, a new record for the longest game in terms of time for both franchises, as well as innings for the Rays. The Rays won 5\u20134.\n\nWhile the Orioles would ultimately miss the playoffs in 2013, they finished with a record of 85\u201377, tying the [[2013 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for third place in the AL East. By posting winning records in 2012 and 2013, the Orioles achieved the feat of back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1996 and 1997.\n\n=====2014 season=====\n{{main|2014 Baltimore Orioles season}}\nOn September 16, the Orioles clinched the division for the first time since 1997 with a win against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as well as making it back to the postseason for the second time in three years. The Orioles finished the 2014 season with a 96\u201366 record and went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers in the [[2014 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. Notably, the three Tigers starters were winners of the previous 3 AL [[Cy Young Award]]s; [[Max Scherzer]] (2013), [[Justin Verlander]] (2011), and [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] (2012). The O's were then in turn swept by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the [[2014 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].\n\n=====2015 season=====\n\nOn April 26, the Orioles scored 18 runs against the [[Boston Red Sox]], the most runs they had scored in a single game, since they defeated the [[Cleveland Indians]] 18\u20139<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/scoreboard/20060419.html|title=Major League Baseball : Scoreboard|work=mlb.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref> on April 19, 2006.

Left to right: Home, Away, Saturday (away with gray pants), Friday (away with gray pants.).]]\nThe Orioles' home uniform is white with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. The road uniform is gray with the word \"Baltimore\" written across the chest. A long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the \"away\" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of [[Edward Bennett Williams]] when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation's capital region after the moving of the former [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the team's attendance came from the metro Washington area. An alternate uniform is black with the word \"Orioles\" written across the chest. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate \"O's\" cap, whether at home or on the road; the cartoon bird batting helmet is still used with this uniform (see description on home and road design).\n\nFor 2012, the team unveiled its new uniforms. There was a change to the cap insignia, with the cartoon Oriole returning. Home caps are white in front and black at the back with an orange bill, while the road caps are all black on top with an orange bill. The Orioles also introduced a new alternate orange uniform to be worn on Saturday home games throughout the 2012 season.\n\nIn 2013, ESPN ran a \"Battle of the Uniforms\" contest between all 30 Major League clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed Cardinals in the championship round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9293168/orioles-win-title|title=Battle of the Uniforms:  Orioles win title|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Orioles announced since their win in New York against the [[New York Yankees]] they will wear their 'new orange' jerseys every Saturday for the rest of the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|2014 season]] both home and away. They have since continued to wear the orange jerseys on most Saturday road games.\n\nFor 2017, the Orioles began to use their batting practice caps for select games with the black uniforms. The aforementioned caps resemble their regular road caps save for the black bill.\n\n==Radio and television coverage==\n{{further|List of Baltimore Orioles broadcasters}}\n\n===Radio===\nIn Baltimore, Orioles games on radio can be heard over [[WJZ-FM]] (105.7&nbsp;FM). [[Jim Hunter (sportscaster)|Jim Hunter]] and [[Joe Angel]] alternate as [[play-by-play]] announcers. WJZ-FM also feeds the games to a [[Baltimore Orioles Radio Network|network]] of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C. and all or portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nWJZ-FM is in its second stint as the Orioles' flagship radio outlet; the station had carried the team previously from 2007 through 2010. Previous radio flagships for the Orioles have been [[WCBM]] (680 AM) from 1954 to 1956, and again for the 1987 season; [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] (1090 AM) over three separate stints (1957 to 1978, 1988 to 2006, and 2011 to 2014); and WFBR (1300 AM, now [[WJZ (AM)|WJZ]]) from 1979 through 1986.\n\n===Television===\nThe [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]] (MASN), co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team's exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Saturday games]] on either [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (via its Baltimore affiliate, [[WBFF]]) or [[Fox Sports 1]], or ''[[Major League Baseball on ESPN|Sunday Night Baseball]]'' on [[ESPN]]. Many MASN telecasts in conflict with Nationals' game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed.\n\nVeteran sportscaster [[Gary Thorne]] is the current lead television announcer, with [[Jim Hunter (sportscaster)|Jim Hunter]] as his backup along with Hall of Fame member and former Orioles pitcher [[Jim Palmer]] and former Oriole infielder [[Mike Bordick]] as color analysts, who almost always work separately. All telecasts on MASN and WJZ-TV are shown in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nAs part of the settlement of a television broadcast rights dispute with [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic]], the Orioles severed their Comcast ties at the end of the 2006 season. Comcast SportsNet had been the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, when it was Home Team Sports.\n\nWJZ-TV was the Orioles' broadcast TV home, completing its latest stint from 1994 through 2017. Since MASN acquired rights in 2007, its coverage was [[simulcast]] on WJZ-TV under the branding \"MASN on WJZ 13\". MASN elected not to syndicate any Orioles or [[Washington Nationals]] games to broadcast television for the 2018 season, marking the first time since the Orioles' arrival that their games are not on local broadcast television.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zurawik|first1=David|title=After 64 years, no lineup of Orioles games will be on Baltimore broadcast TV in 2018|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-fe-zontv-orioles-masn-wjz-20180327-story.html|work=Baltimore Sun}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, WJZ-TV carried the team from their arrival in Baltimore in 1954 through 1978. In the first four seasons, WJZ-TV shared coverage with Baltimore's other two stations, [[WMAR-TV]] and [[WBAL-TV]]. The games moved to WMAR from 1979 through 1993 before returning to WJZ-TV.  From 1994 to 2009, some Orioles games aired on [[WNUV]]. \n\nSix former Oriole franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting: [[Chuck Thompson]] (who was also the voice of the old NFL [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]); [[Jon Miller]] (now with the [[San Francisco Giants]]); [[Ernie Harwell]], [[Herb Carneal]]; [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] and [[Harry Caray]] (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paperofrecord.com/paper_view.asp?PaperId=834&RecordId=1&PageId=7750536&iZyNetId={2E6BBCCF-5CD0-46CC-A586-07221F6521B4}&iOrder=2&iOrderDir=0&iCurrentBlock=1 |title=About Paper of Record |publisher=paperofrecord.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>).\n\nOther former Baltimore announcers include [[Josh Lewin]] (currently with [[New York Mets]]), [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]], [[Tom Marr]], Scott Garceau, [[Mel Proctor]], [[Michael Reghi]], former major league catcher [[Buck Martinez]] (now [[Toronto Blue Jays]] play-by-play), and former Oriole players including Brooks Robinson, pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] and outfielder [[John Lowenstein]]. In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', but only lasted one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.\n\n==Musical traditions==\n\n===\"O!\"===\nSince its introduction at games by the \"Roar from 34\", led by [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and others, in the late 1970s, it has been a tradition at Orioles games for fans to yell out the \"Oh\" in the line \"Oh, say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave\" in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has special meaning to Baltimore historically, as it was written during the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in the [[War of 1812]] by [[Francis Scott Key]], a Baltimorean. \"O\" is not only short for \"Oriole\", but the vowel is also a stand-out aspect of the [[Baltimorese|Baltimorean accent]].\n\nThe tradition is often carried out at other sporting events, both professional or amateur, and even sometimes at non-sporting events where the anthem is played, throughout the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore/Washington area]] and beyond. Fans in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], chanted \"O!\" even before the [[Norfolk Tides|Tides]] became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the \"O!\" cry at [[Washington Nationals]] games at [[RFK Stadium]]. The \"O!\" chant is also common at sporting events for the various [[Maryland Terrapins]] teams at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. At [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]'s induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the crowd, composed mostly of Orioles fans, carried out the \"O!\" tradition during [[Tony Gwynn]]'s daughter's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Additionally, a faint but audible \"O!\" could be heard on the television broadcast of Barack Obama's pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the National Anthem played before his entrance. A resounding \"O!\" bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans that attended the November 21, 2010, away game at the [[Carolina Panthers]]' [[Bank of America Stadium]] in Charlotte, North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Edward|title='It was like a home game' vs. Panthers, said Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-11-22/sports/bs-sp-ravens-notebook-1122-20101121_1_ravens-quarterback-joe-flacco-ed-reed-panthers-fans|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> A similar loud \"O!\" was heard from fans attending [[Super Bowl XLVII]] between the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ravens hold on to win Super Bowl, 34-31|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-02-04/news/bs-md-super-bowl-mainbar-20130203_1_john-harbaugh-jacoby-jones-ravens|accessdate=13 April 2016|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=4 February 2013}}</ref> The \"O!\" chant was also heard during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], when Baltimore native [[Michael Phelps]] received one of his gold medals on August 9, 2016.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/08/10/baltimores-national-anthem-oh-gives-michael-phelps-a-gold-medal-laugh/ Baltimore\u2019s National Anthem \u2018Oh!\u2019 gives Michael Phelps a gold-medal laugh - The Washington Post<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn recent years, when the Orioles host the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], fans have begun to shout out the multiple instances of the word \"O\" in ''\"[[O Canada]]''\".

He also has an orange violin that spins for the fiddle solos. He went by the name Zillbilly and had done the skit from the 1999 season until shortly before he died in early 2013. During a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles' dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-14/features/1997287024_1_orioles-dugout-country-boy-fans |title=John Denver At Camden Yards &#124; 7th-inning stretch belonged to Denver Orioles: Time after time, 'Thank God I'm a Country Boy' got the stadium rocking.

The theme from ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song \"Magic to Do\" from the stage musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' was used that season to commemorate \"Orioles Magic\" on 33rd Street. During the Orioles' heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled \"Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen)\", was composed by Walt Woodward,<ref name=BaltSun>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/videogallery/81640911/Entertainment/Orioles-Magic-song-by-Walt-Woodward |title= Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen) |publisher= The Baltimore Sun |author= Walt Woodward  |date=  1970 |accessdate= October 12, 2014}}</ref> and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) is only played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) after wins. [[Seven Nation Army]] is played as a hype song while the fans chant the signature bass riff as a rally cry during key moments of a game or after a walk-off hit.\n\n===The First Army Band===\nDuring the Orioles' final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe [[American flag]] at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium's center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters' eye. During the Orioles' final home game of the season, [[The United States Army Field Band]] from [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]] performs the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three [[World Series]] in which the Orioles played in: [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1971 World Series|1971]] and [[1979 World Series|1979]]. They are introduced as the \"First Army Band\" during the pregame ceremonies.\n\n==PA announcer==\nFor 23&nbsp;years, [[Rex Barney]] was the [[Public address|PA announcer]] for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression \"Give that fan a contract\", uttered whenever a fan caught a [[foul ball]], was one of his trademarks&nbsp;\u2013 the other being his distinct \"Thank Yooooou...\" following every announcement. (He was also known on occasion to say \"Give that fan an error\" after a dropped foul ball.) Barney died on August 12, 1997, and in his honor that night's game at Camden Yards against the Oakland Athletics was held without a public\u2013address announcer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1997AUGUST.stm |title=August 1997 |publisher=baseballlibrary.com |accessdate=November 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBarney was replaced as Camden Yards' PA announcer by Dave McGowan, who held the position until December 2011.\n\nLifelong Orioles fan and former [[MLB Fan Cave]] resident Ryan Wagner is the current PA announcer.

When the Orioles were the St. Louis Browns, they played in only one World Series, the [[1944 World Series|1944 matchup]] against their Sportsman's Park tenants, the [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]].

In ca. 200 BC, these tribes then migrated, possibly accompanied by some Germanic elements, southeastwards into the North Pontic region. Some elements appear to have become assimilated, to some extent, by the surrounding [[Sarmatians]] by the 3rd century.\n\nAlthough largely sedentary, some elements may have adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle. It has not, so far, been possible to identify archaeological sites which can be conclusively attributed to the Bastarnae. The archaeological horizons most often associated by scholars with the Bastarnae are the [[Zarubintsy culture|Zarubintsy]] and Poienesti-Lukashevka cultures.\n\nThe Bastarnae first came into conflict with the Romans during the 1st century BC, when, in alliance with [[Dacians]] and Sarmatians, they unsuccessfully resisted Roman expansion into [[Moesia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Later, they appear to have maintained friendly relations with the [[Roman empire]] during the first two centuries AD. This changed from c. 180, when the Bastarnae are recorded as participants in an invasion of Roman territory, once again in alliance with Sarmatian and Dacian elements. In the mid-3rd century, the Bastarnae were part of a [[Goth]]ic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the Balkan provinces of the Roman empire.\n\nLarge numbers of Bastarnae were resettled within the Roman empire in the late 3rd century.\n\n== Ancient sources ==\nAccording to [[Polybius]] (200 \u2013 118 BC):\n\n\"''A mission from the Dardanians now arrived, telling of the Bastarnae, their numbers, the huge size and the valour of their warriors, and also pointing out that Perseus and the Galatians were in league with this tribe. They said they were much more afraid of him than of the Bastarnae, and they begged for aid.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/25*.html|title=Polybius \u2022 Histories \u2014 Book\u00a025|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}</ref>''\n\nAccording to [[Livy]] (64 BC \u2013 17 AD): \n\n\"''The way to the Hadriatic and to Italy lay through the Scordisci; that was the only practicable route for an army, and the Scordisci were expected to grant a passage to the Bastarnae without any difficulty, for neither in speech nor habits were they dissimilar, and it was hoped that they would unite forces with them when they saw that they were going to secure the plunder of a very wealthy nation.''\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to [[Strabo]] (64 BC \u2013 24 AD): \n\n\"''However, it is clear from the \"climata\" and the parallel distances that if one travels longitudinally towards the east, one encounters the regions that are about the Borysthenes and that are to the north of the Pontus; but what is beyond Germany and what beyond the countries which are next after Germany \u2014 whether one should say the Bastarnae, as most writers suspect, or say that others lie in between, either the Iazyges, or the Roxolani, or certain other of the wagon-dwellers \u2014 it is not easy to say; nor yet whether they extend as far as the ocean along its entire length, or whether any part is uninhabitable by reason of the cold or other cause, or whether even a different race of people, succeeding the Germans, is situated between the sea and the eastern Germans. And this same ignorance prevails also in regard to the rest of the peoples that come next in order on the north; for I know neither the Bastarnae, nor the Sauromatae, nor, in a word, any of the peoples who dwell above the Pontus, nor how far distant they are from the Atlantic Sea, nor whether their countries border upon it.\"<ref name=\":2\" />''\n\nAccroding to [[Plutarch]] (AD 46 \u2013 120 AD):\n\n''\"He also secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Basternae, an equestrian host and warlike; and he invited the Illyrians, through Genthius their king, to take part with him in the war. And a report prevailed that the Barbarians had been hired by him to pass through lower Gaul, along the coast of the Adriatic, and make an incursion into Italy.''\"''<ref name=\":0\" />''\n\nAccording to [[Tacitus]] (56 \u2013 120 AD): \n\n''\"As to the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti, and Fenni I am in doubt whether I should class them with the Germans or the Sarmat\u00e6, although indeed the Peucini called by some Bastarn\u00e6, are like Germans in their language, mode of life, and in the permanence of their settlements. They all live in filth and sloth, and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the Sarmat\u00e6.\"<ref name=\":3\" />''\n\nAccording to [[Cassius Dio]] (155 \u2013 235 AD):\n\n''\"During the same period in which these events occurred Marcus Crassus was sent into Macedonia and Greece and carried on war with the Dacians and Bastarnae. I have already stated who the former were and why they had become hostile; the Bastarnae, on the other hand, who are properly classed as Scythians, had at this time crossed the Ister and subdued the part of Moesia opposite them, and afterwards subdued the Triballi who adjoin this district and the Dardani who inhabit the Triballian country.\"''\n\nAccording to [[Zosimus|Zosismus]] (490s \u2013 510 AD):\n\n''\"He likewise left in Thrace the Bastarnae, a Scythian people, who submitted to him, giving them land to inhabit there; on which account they observed the Roman laws and customs.''\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the tribal name is uncertain. It is not even clear whether it was an exonym (a name ascribed to them by outsiders) or an endonym (a name by which the Bastarnae described themselves). A related question is whether the groups denoted \"Bastarnae\" by the Romans considered themselves a distinct ethnic group at all (endonym) or whether it was a generic exonym used by the Greco-Romans to denote a disparate group of tribes of the Carpathian region that could not be classified as Dacians or Sarmatians.\n\nOne possible derivation is from the [[proto-Germanic]] word ''*bastjan'' (from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''b\u02b0as-'') means \"binding\" or \"tie\".<ref>K\u00f6bler *''b\u02b0as''</ref> In this case, ''Bastarnae'' may have had the original meaning of a coalition or ''bund'' of tribes.\n\nIt is possible that the Roman term ''[[basterna]]'', denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, the name of the people is derived from it) which was known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon-train for their families.<ref name=\"Dio LI.24.4\">Dio LI.24.4</ref>\n\nIt has also been suggested that the name is linked with the Germanic word ''bastard'', meaning illegitimate or mongrel. But Batty considers this derivation unlikely.<ref>Batty (2008)</ref> If the name is an endonym, then this derivation is unlikely, as most endonyms have flattering meanings (e.g. \"brave\", \"strong\", \"noble\").\n\nTruba\u010dev<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Truba\u010dev INDOARICA \u0432 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435, pp. 212-3</ref> proposes a derivation from [[Old Persian]], [[Avestan]] ''bast-'' \"bound, tied; slave\" (cf. [[Ossetic]] b\u00e6tt\u0259n \"bind\", bast \"bound\") and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''*arna-'' \"offspring\", equating it with the ''\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9'' \"slave Sporoi\" mentioned by [[Nonnus]] and [[Cosmas of Maiuma|Cosmas]], where [[Sporoi]] is the people [[Procopius]] mentions as the ancestors of the [[Slavs]].<ref>Procopius. Wars (VIII.I4, 22-30)</ref>\n\n== Territory ==\n\nThe original homeland of the Bastarnae remains uncertain. Babe\u015f and Shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern [[Pomerania]] on the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] coast of NW Poland, on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material e.g. a Pomeranian-style [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] found in a Poiene\u015fti site in [[Moldavia]]<ref>Shchukin (1989) 65-6, 71-2</ref> (although Batty considers the evidence insufficient).<ref>Batty (2008) 248</ref> Babe\u015f identifies the Sidoni, a branch of the Bastarnae which [[Strabo]] places north of the Danube delta<ref name=\"Strabo VII.3.17\">Strabo VII.3.17</ref> with the ''Sidini'' located by Ptolemy in Pomerania.<ref>Babe\u015f (1969) 195-218</ref>\n\nBatty argues that Greco-Roman sources of the 1st century AD locate the Bastarnae homeland on the northern side of the [[Carpathians|Northern Carpathian]] mountain range, encompassing S.E. [[Poland]] and SW [[Ukraine]] (i.e. the region traditionally known as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]).<ref name=\"Batty 2008 238\">Batty (2008) 238</ref> Pliny locates the Bastarnae between the [[Suebi]]<ref>Pliny NH IV.81</ref> and the [[Dacians]] (''contermini Dacis'').<ref>Pliny NH IV.100</ref> The [[Peutinger Map]] (produced in ca. 400 AD, but including material from as early as the 1st century) shows the Bastarnae (mis-spelt ''Blastarni'') north of the Carpathian mountains and appears to name the Galician Carpathians as the ''Alpes Bastarnicae''.<ref name=\"Batty 2008 238\"/>\n\nFrom Galicia, the Bastarnae expanded into modern-day [[Moldavia]] and [[Bessarabia]], reaching the [[Danube delta]]. Strabo describes the Bastarnae as inhabiting the territory \"between the ''Ister'' (river Danube) and the ''Borysthenes'' (river Dnieper)\". He identifies three sub-tribes of the Bastarnae: the Atmoni, Sidoni and Peucini. The latter derived their name from [[Peuce]], a large island in the Danube delta, which they had colonised.<ref name=\"Strabo VII.3.17\"/> The 2nd-century geographer [[Ptolemy]] states that the ''Carpiani'' or [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]] (believed to have occupied [[Moldavia]]) separated the Peucini from the other Bastarnae \"above Dacia\" (i.e. north of Dacia).<ref>Ptolemy III.5.9</ref>\n\nIt thus appears that the Bastarnae were settled in a vast arc stretching around the northern and eastern flanks of the Carpathians from SE Poland to the Danube delta. The larger group inhabited the northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians and the region between the [[Prut]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers (Moldova Republic/Western Ukraine), while a separate group (the Peucini, Sidoni and Atmoni) dwelt in and north of the Danube delta region.<ref>Barrington Plate 22</ref>\n\n== Ethno-linguistic affiliation ==\n\nScholars hold divergent theories about the ethnicity of the Bastarnae. The view, following what appears to be the most authoritative view among earliest scholars, is that they spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+40+57&fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0144|title=Titus Livius (Livy), \nThe History of Rome, Book 40,\nchapter 57|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-08-12}}</ref> However others hold that they were Scythian/Germanic,<ref name=\":2\" /> or mixed Germanic/Sarmatian.<ref name=\":3\" /> A fringe theory is that they were [[Proto-Slavic]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Shchukin argues that ethnicity of the Bastarnae was unique and rather than trying to label the Bastanae as Celtic, Germanic or Sarmatian, it should be accepted that the \"Basternae were the Basternae\".<ref name=\"Shchukin, 1990.

Pg 10</ref> Batty argues that assigning an \"ethnicity\" to the Bastarnae is meaningless, as in the context of the [[Iron Age]] Pontic-Danubian region, with its multiple overlapping peoples and languages, ethnicity was a very fluid concept: it could and did change rapidly and frequently, according to socio-political vicissitudes. This was especially true of the Bastarnae, who are attested over a relatively vast area.<ref>Batty (2008) 243</ref>\n\n=== Celtic ===\n\nA leading reason to consider the Bastarnae as Celtic is that the regions they are documented to have occupied (northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians) overlapped to a great extent with the locations of Celtic tribes attested in the northern Carpathians. Indeed, a large part of this region, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], may derive its name from its former Celtic inhabitants the [[Taurisci]], [[Osi (ancient tribe)|Osi]], [[Cotini]] and [[Anartes]] of Slovakia and northern Romania and the [[Britogalli]] of the Danubian Mouth region.<ref>Batty (2008) 222</ref> In addition, archaeological cultures, which some scholars have linked to the Bastarnae (Poiene\u015fti-Lukashevka asnd Zarubintsy), display pronounced Celtic affinities. Finally, the arrival of the Bastarnae in the Pontic-Danubian region, which can be dated to 233-216 BC according to two ancient sources,<ref name=\"Batty 2008 237\">Batty (2008) 237</ref> coincides with the latter phase of Celtic migration into the region (400-200 BC).\n\nThe earliest historians give a Celtic or Gallic origin to the Bastarnae. Roman historian [[Livy]], writing in c. AD 10, attest that the Bastarnae spoke Celtic. Relating the Bastarnic invasion of the Balkans of 179 BC (see [[Bastarnae#Conflict with Rome|Conflict with Rome]] below), he describes them then as \"''they were not very different in either language or manners''\" to the Celtic tribe of the [[Scordisci]], a tribe of [[Pannonia]]. The Scordisci are described as Celtic by [[Strabo]] (although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians).<ref>Strabo VII.5.2</ref>  The Greeks historian [[Plutarch]] infrom us that the Roman consul Hostilius \"''secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Basternae\".<ref name=\":0\" />''\n\nHowever, a Celtic identity for the Bastarnae is apparently contradicted by [[Polybius]] (writing ca. 150 BC), who was an actual contemporary of the events described, unlike Livy, who was writing some 200 years later. Polybius clearly distinguishes the Bastarnae from the \"Galatae\" (i.e. Celts): \"an embassy from the [[Dardani]] arrived [at the [[Roman Senate]]], talking of the Bastarnae, their huge numbers, the strength and valour of their warriors, and also reporting that Perseus [king of Macedon] and the Galatae were in league with this tribe\".<ref>Polybius XXV.6.2</ref> In addition, inscription AE (1905) 14, recording a campaign on the [[Hungarian Plain]] by the Augustan-era general [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinucius]] (10 BC{{sfn|Almassy|2006|p=253}} or 8 BC{{sfn|CAH Vol X|1996|p=}}), also appears to distinguish the Bastarnae from neighbouring Celtic tribes: \"Marcus Vinucius... governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi,...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.\"<ref>Ann\u00e9e Epigraphique (1905) no. 14</ref>\n\nThe names of three Bastarnae leaders are preserved in the ancient sources are of Celtic origin: Cotto,<ref name=\"Livy XL.57\">Livy XL.57</ref> Clondicus,<ref name=\"Livy XL.58\">Livy XL.58</ref> and Teutagonus<ref>[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] ''Argonautica'' VI.97</ref><ref>Batty (2008) 222. Cotto: cf. [[Cottius]], king of the Alpine [[Salassi]] tribe and friend of [[Augustus]], after whom were named the [[Alpes Cottiae]] Roman province; and the [[Cotini]] Celtic tribe of the northern Carpathians. Both probably derived from ''cotto-'' = \"old\" or \"crooked\"). (Faliyeyev (2007) entries 3806, 3890). Clondicus: cf. Klondyke, name of some places in Wales and Scotland. Teutagonus:</ref> \n\n{{Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD)}}\n\n=== Germanic ===\nGreco-Roman geographers of the 1st century AD are unanimous and specific that the Bastarnae were [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] in language and culture. The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (writing c. AD 5-20) says the Bastarnae are \"of Germanic stock\".<ref name=\"Strabo VII.3.17\" /> The Roman geographer [[Pliny the Elder]] (c. AD 77), classifies the Bastarnae and Peucini as constituting one of the 5 main subdivisions of Germanic peoples (he lists the other subdivisions as the ''Inguaeones'', ''Istuaeones'' and ''Hermiones'' ([[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] tribes), and the ''Vandili'' ([[Vandals]], [[East Germanic]], but he classifies differently than the Bastarnae).<ref>Pliny NH IV.14</ref>\n\nThe Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. AD 100) describes the Bastaenae as Germans with substantial Sarmatian influence, but moves on to state: \"The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like the Germans in their language, way of life and types of dwelling.\"<ref name=\"Tacitus G.46\">Tacitus G.46</ref>\n\n===Scytho-Sarmatian ===\n\nStrabo includes the [[Roxolani]], generally considered by scholars to have been a [[Sarmatian]] tribe, in a list of Bastarnae subgroups.<ref name=\"Strabo VII.3.17\"/> However, this may simply be an error due to the close proximity of the two peoples north of the Danube delta. In the 3rd century, the Greek historian [[Dio Cassius]] states that the \"Bastarnae are properly classed as Scythians\" and \"members of the Scythian race\".<ref>Dio LI.23.3, 24.2</ref> Likewise, the 6th-century historian [[Zosimus]], reporting events around AD 280, refers to \"the Bastarnae, a Scythian people\".<ref name=\"Zosimus I.34\">Zosimus I.34</ref> However, it appears that these late Greco-Roman chroniclers used the term \"Scythian\" more often in a geographical sense (i.e. inhabitants of the region they called Scythia i.e. the Pontic region north of the Danube) rather than in an ethnic one (i.e. members of the [[Scythians|Scythian]] people, steppe nomads of Iranic origin, related to the Sarmatians, who had supplanted the Scythians' dominance of the steppes in the period BC). For example, Zosimus also routinely refers to the [[Goths]], who were undoubtedly Germanic-speakers, as \"Scythians\".\n\nIt is possible that some Bastarnae may have been assimilated by the surrounding (and possibly dominant) Sarmatians, perhaps adopting their tongue (which belonged to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] group of Indo-European languages) and/or Sarmatian customs. Thus Tacitus' comment that \"mixed marriages are giving [the Bastarnae] to some extent the vile appearance of the Sarmatians\".<ref name=\"Tacitus G.46\"/> On the other hand, the Bastarnae maintained a separate name-identity until ca. AD 300, probably implying retention of their distinctive ethno-linguistic heritage until that time.<ref>cf. Historia Augusta ''Probus'' 18</ref> It seems, on balance, likely that the core population of Bastarnae had always been, and continued to be, Germanic in language and culture.\n\n== Material culture ==\n[[File:Rekonstruktionsversuch bastarnischer Trachten (eine Gruppe aus Pomoranischer Kultur) von dem Aussere Karpatensenke und Westbeskiden, 2 bis 3 Jh.

In any event, post-1960s archaeological theory questions the validity of equating material \"cultures\", as defined by archaeologists, with distinct ethnic groups. On this view, it is impossible to attribute a \"culture\" to a particular ethnic group: it is likely that the material cultures discerned in the region belonged to several, if not all, of the groups inhabiting it. These cultures probably represent relatively large-scale socio-economic interactions between disparate communities of the broad region, possibly including mutually antagonistic groups.<ref name=\"Todd 2004 23-4\"/>\n\nIt is not even certain whether the Bastarnae were [[sedentism|sedentary]] or [[nomad]]ic (or semi-nomadic). Tacitus' statement that they were \"German in their way of life and types of dwelling\" implies a sedentary bias, but their close relations with the Sarmatians, who were nomadic, may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle for some Bastarnae, as does the wide geographical range of their attested inhabitation.<ref name=\"Todd 2004 23\">Todd (2004) 23</ref> If the Bastarnae were nomadic, then the sedentary \"cultures\" identified by archaeologists in their ''lebensraum'' would not represent them. Nomadic peoples generally leave scant traces, due to the impermanent materials and foundations used in the construction of their dwellings.\n\nScholars have identified two closely related sedentary \"cultures\" as possible candidates to represent the Bastarnae (among other peoples) as their locations broadly correspond to where ancient sources placed the Basternae: the [[Zarubintsy culture]] lying in the forest-steppe zone in northern Ukraine-southern Belarus, and the '''Poiene\u015fti-Lukashevka''' ([[Luc\u0103\u015feuca]]) culture in northern Moldavia.<ref name=\"Batty 2008 237\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Shchukin|1990|p=10}}</ref> These cultures were characterised by agriculture, documented by numerous finds of sickles. Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types, with posts supporting the walls, a hearth in the middle, and large conical pits located nearby. Some sites were defended by ditches and banks, structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe.<ref>Mallory. EIEC''. Page 657</ref> Inhabitants practiced cremation. Cremated remains were either placed in large, hand-made ceramic urns, or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]]-type ''fibulae'' (attesting the continuing strength of Celtic influence in this region).\n\nA major problem with associating Lukashevka and Zarubintsy with the Bastarnae is that both cultures had disappeared by the early 1st century AD, although the Bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the Roman [[Principate]].<ref>Batty (2008) 237-9</ref> Another issue is that the Poiene\u015fti-Lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the [[Costoboci]], a people considered ethnic-[[Dacians|Dacian]] by mainstream scholarship, which inhabited northern Moldavia, according to Ptolemy (ca. AD 140). Indeed, Mircea Babe\u015f and Silvia Theodor, the two Romanian archaeologists who identified Lukashevka as Bastarnic, nevertheless insisted that the majority of the population in the Lukashevka sphere (N. Moldavia) was \"Geto-Dacian\".<ref name=\"Batty 2008 238\"/> A further problem is that neither of these cultures were present in the Danube delta region, where a major concentration of Bastarnae are attested by the ancient sources.<ref name=\"Batty 2008 237\"/>\n\nStarting in about AD 200, the [[Chernyakhov]] culture became established in the W. Ukraine/Moldova region inhabited by the Bastarnae. The culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts, as well as of uniformity over a vast area. Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the [[Goth]]ic ''ethnos'' into the region from the Northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian. Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, [[Early Slavs|proto-Slavs]], [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and possibly the Bastarnae.<ref>Todd (2004) 26</ref>\n\n== Relations with Rome ==\n\n=== Roman Republican era (to 30 BC) ===\n\n==== Allies of Philip of Macedon (179-8 BC) ====\n[[File:Philip V of Macedon BM.jpg|thumb|right|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Philip V of Macedon. [[British Museum]], London ]]\n\nThe Bastarnae first appear in the historical record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in massive force. They did so at the invitation of their long-time ally, king [[Philip V of Macedon]], a direct descendant of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]], one of the [[Diadochi]], the generals of [[Alexander the Great]] who had shared out his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Romans in the [[Second Macedonian War]] (200-197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful [[Hellenistic]] monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army.{{refn|group=Note|name=cnoteb|The terms imposed on Philip V of Macedon in 196 BC were: (i) loss of all possessions outside [[Macedon]]ia proper (Philip had previously ruled extensive territories in Greece, Thrace and Asia Minor); (ii) standing army limited to 5,000 men and no elephants; (iii) navy limited to 5 warships plus royal galley; (iv) reparation payment of 1,000 [[talent (measurement)|talents]] (c. 26 tonnes) of silver, equivalent then to c. 4 tonnes of gold. (In antiquity, silver was far more valuable than today: the gold/silver value ratio was c. 1:7, compared to c. 1:100 today); (v) prohibited from waging war outside his borders without the Roman Senate's permission<ref>Livy XXXIII.30</ref>}} After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate's dictats, Philip had been goaded beyond endurance by the incessant and devastating raiding of the [[Dardani]], a warlike Thraco-Illyrian<ref>A Mocsy. Pannonia and Upper Moesia</ref> tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively. Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations in earlier times, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence. First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani. After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern [[Kosovo]]/[[Skopje]] region), to ensure that the region was permanently subdued. In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast. Although he was aware that the Bastarnae were hardly likely to achieve the same success as [[Hannibal]] some 40 years earlier, and would most likely end up cut to pieces by the Romans, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece.<ref name=\"Livy XL.57\"/>\n\nBut Philip, now 60 years of age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive. The Bastarnae host was still ''en route'' through Thrace, where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals, who were unable (or unwilling) to provide them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through. Probably in the vicinity of [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide. The terrified local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of ''Mons Donuca'', the highest mountain in Thrace ([[Musala|Mt. Musala]], Rila Mts., Bulgaria). A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm. Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout. Back at their [[laager|wagon-laager]] in the plain, around half the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving c. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia.<ref name=\"Livy XL.58\"/>\n\nPhilip's son and successor [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], while protesting his loyalty to Rome, deployed his Bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in Dardania, presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the Dardani the following summer. But in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the Dardani. The Bastarnae easily beat off the attackers, chased them back to their chief town, and besieged them. But they were surprised in the rear by a second force of Dardani, which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths, and proceeded to storm and ransack it. Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home. Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way.<ref>Livy XLI.19</ref> Despite the failure of Philip's Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state.<ref>Livy XLI.23 and XLII.12-4</ref> Rome declared war on Perseus in 171 BC and after the Macedonian army was crushed at the [[Battle of Pydna]] (168 BC), Macedonia was split up into 4 Roman puppet-cantons (167 BC).<ref>Livy XLV.19</ref> 21 years later, these were in turn abolished and annexed to the [[Roman Republic]] as the [[Macedonia (Roman province)|province of Macedonia]] (146 BC).\n\n==== Allies of Getae high king Burebista (62 BC) ====\n[[File:Scythia Minor map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Scythia Minor]] (Dobruja), showing the Greek coastal cities of Histria, Tomis, Callatis and Dionysopolis (Istria, Constan\u0163a, Mangalia and Balchik).]]\n[[File:HistriaCoins.jpg|thumb|right|Coin issued by the Greek coastal city of [[Histria (Sinoe)|Histria]] (Sinoe)]]\nThe Bastarnae first came into direct conflict with Rome as a result of expansion into the lower Danube region by the [[proconsuls]] (governors) of Macedonia in the period 75-72 BC.

The Getae occupied the region today called [[Wallachia]] as well as Scythia Minor and were either a [[Dacian language|Dacian]]- or [[Thracian language|Thracian]]- speaking people.{{refn|group=Note|name=cnoted|There is controversy about whether the [[Getae]] were Dacian or Thracian speakers and whether those two languages were similar.

According to Georgiev, the language spoken by the Getae should be classified as \"Daco-Moesian\" and regarded as quite distinct from Thracian.<ref>Vladimir Georgiev (Gheorghiev), ''Raporturile dintre limbile dac\u0103, trac\u0103 \u015fi frigian\u0103'', \"Studii Clasice\" Journal, II, 1960, 39-58.</ref> Support for the Daco-Moesian theory can be found in Dio, who confirms that the Moesians and Getae on the south bank of the Danube were Dacians.<ref>Dio LI.22.6-7</ref> But the scant evidence available for these two extinct languages does not permit any firm conclusions.

In addition, he had established his hegemony over neighbouring Sarmatian and Bastarnae tribes. At its peak, the Getae kingdom reportedly was able to muster 200,000 warriors. Burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against Roman encroachment, conducting many raids against Roman allies in [[Moesia]] and Thrace, penetrating as far as Macedonia and [[Illyria]].<ref>Strabo VII.3.11-12</ref>\n\nThe coalition's main chance came in 62 BC, when the Greek cities rebelled against Roman rule. In 61 BC, the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of Macedonia, [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida|Gaius Antonius]], nicknamed ''Hybrida'' (\"The Monster\", an uncle of the famous [[Mark Antony]]) led an army against the Greek cities. As his army approached [[Histria (Sinoe)]], Antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion, leaving his infantry without cavalry cover, a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the Dardani.<ref>Dio XXXVIII.10.2</ref> Dio implies that he did so out of cowardice, in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition. But it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force, probably [[Sarmatians]]. A Bastarnae host, which had crossed the Danube to assist the Histrians, promptly attacked, surrounded and massacred the Roman infantry, capturing several of their ''[[vexillum|vexilla]]'' (military standards).<ref>Dio XXXVIII.10.3 and LI.26.5</ref> This battle resulted in the collapse of the Roman position on the lower Danube. Burebista apparently annexed the Greek cities (55-48 BC).<ref>Cri\u015fan (1978) 118</ref> At the same time, the subjugated \"allied\" tribes of Moesia and Thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with Rome, as they had to be re-conquered by [[Augustus]] in 29-8 BC (see below).\n\nFor 44 BC, Roman [[dictator perpetuus|dictator-for-life]] [[Julius Caesar]] planned to lead a major campaign to crush Burebista and his allies once and for all, but he was assassinated before it could start.<ref>Strabo VII.3.5</ref> However, the campaign was made redundant by Burebista's overthrow and death in the same year, after which his Getae empire fragmented into 4, later 5 independent petty kingdoms. These were militarily far weaker, as Strabo assessed their combined military potential at just 40,000 armed men, and were often involved in internecine warfare.<ref>Strabo VII.3.11</ref><ref>Dio LI.26.1</ref> The [[Geto-Dacians]] did not again become a threat to Roman hegemony in the lower Danube until the rise of [[Decebal]] 130 years later (AD 86).\n\n=== Roman Principate (30 BC - AD 284) ===\n\n==== Augustan era (30 BC - AD 14) ====\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Augustus]] in the garb of Roman ''[[imperator]]'' (military supreme commander).

[[Musei Vaticani]], Rome ]]\n\nOnce he had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC, Caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son [[Augustus]] inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire's southeastern European border to the line of the Danube from the [[Alps]], the [[Dinaric Alps]] and Macedonia. The primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply-route between the Roman armies in the region.<ref>''Res Gestae'' 30</ref>\n\nOn the lower Danube, which was given priority over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia. The Romans' target were thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from West to East) the [[Triballi]], Moesi and those Getae who dwelt South of the Danube. The Bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers ''Utus'' ([[Vit]]) and ''Ciabrus'' ([[Tsibritsa]]), with their chief town at [[Oescus]] (Gigen, Bulgaria).<ref>Ptolemy</ref> In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida|C. Antonius]] at [[Histria (Sinoe)]] 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called [[Genucla]] (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Romania, in the Danube delta region), controlled by [[Zyraxes]], the local Getan king.<ref name=\"Dio LI.26.5\">Dio LI.26.5</ref> The man selected for the task was [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]], grandson of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] the [[triumvir]] and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.<ref>Dio LI.23.2</ref>\n\nThe Bastarnae provided the ''casus belli'' by crossing the Haemus and attacking the [[Dentheletae]], a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies. Crassus marched to the Dentheletae's assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach. Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but they would not be drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa.<ref>Dio LI.23.5</ref> Crassus now turned his attention to the Moesi, his prime target. After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae. Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem. Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood. As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid. The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon-train carrying their women and children, as these could not move through the trees. Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed. Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome's highest military honour, ''[[spolia opima]]'', but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality.{{refn|group=Note|name=cnotef|Crassus' feat, as Roman commander, of killing the enemy leader in combat arguably entitled him to the highest honour a Roman soldier could gain: the ''[[spolia opima]]'' (literally: \"bountiful spoils\", but this term may be a corruption of ''spolia optima'', \"supreme spoils\"), the right to hang the armour stripped from the enemy leader in the temple of [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] in Rome, in emulation of the Founder of Rome [[Romulus]], a privilege granted only twice previously. But Crassus was denied the honour by Augustus on the technicality that he was not commander-in-chief of Roman forces at the time, a position claimed by Augustus himself.<ref name=\"Dio LI.24.4\" /> Augustus also forbade Crassus to accept the honorary title of ''imperator'' (\"supreme commander\") from his troops, traditional for victorious generals.

This is highly unusual in a relatively well-documented period for a person of such distinction who was still only about 33 years old.{{original research inline|date=October 2011}} His tomb has not been found in the excavated Crassus family mausoleum in Rome. This official \"air-brushing from history\" may imply punitive [[Exile|internal exile]] to a remote location, similar to that inflicted on the contemporary poet, [[Ovid]], who in AD 8, for an unknown offence, was ordered by Augustus to spend the rest of his life in Tomis (Constan\u0163a) on the Black Sea. [[Ronald Syme]] points out the similarity of Crassus' removal from the official record with that of [[Cornelius Gallus]], the contemporary disgraced governor of Egypt, who was recalled by Augustus for assuming inappropriate honours.<ref>Syme (1986) 271-2</ref>}} Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube. Nevertheless, a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort. Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of [[Rholes]], a Getan petty king, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of ''socius et amicus populi Romani'' (\"ally and friend of the Roman people\").<ref>Dio LI.24</ref>\n\nThe following year (28 BC), Crassus marched on Genucla. Petty king Zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the Danube into Scythia to seek aid from the Bastarnae.<ref>Dio LI.26.6</ref> But before he was able to bring reinforcements, Genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the Romans.<ref name=\"Dio LI.26.5\"/> The strategic result of Crassus' campaigns was the permanent annexation of Moesia by Rome.\n\nAbout a decade later, in 10 BC,{{sfn|Almassy|2006|p=253}} the Bastarnae again clashed with Rome during Augustus' conquest of [[Pannonia]] (the ''bellum Pannonicum'' 14\u20139 BC). Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the [[Hungarian Plain]] by the Augustan-era general [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinucius]]: \"Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC]...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the [[Cotini]], Osi,...[missing tribal name] and [[Anartes|Anartii]] to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.\" Most likely, the Bastarnae, in alliance with Dacians, were attempting to assist the hard-pressed Illyrian/Celtic tribes of Pannonia in their resistance to Rome.\n\n==== 1st and 2nd centuries ====\nIt appears that in the final years of Augustus' rule, the Bastarnae made their peace with Rome. The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' (\"Acts of the divine Augustus\" AD 14), a self-congratulatory inscription commissioned by Augustus to list his achievements, states that he received an embassy from the Bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship.<ref>Res Gestae Aug. 31</ref>\n\nIt appears that a treaty was concluded and apparently proved remarkably effective, as no hostilities with the Bastarnae are recorded in surviving ancient sources until c. 175, some 160 years after Augustus' inscription was carved. But surviving evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the Bastarnae clashed with Rome during it.{{refn|group=Note|name=cnoteg|The [[Julio-Claudian]] period and the subsequent [[Year of the Four Emperors|Roman Civil War of 68-9]] (until AD 69) is reasonably well-covered by Tacitus' ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' (although substantial parts are missing) and ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Historiae]]''. But the loss of Tacitus' narrative for the entire [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] period (69-96) and of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'s continuation until 353, as well as of most of [[Dio Cassius]]'s History (up to 229), leaves a massive gap in our knowledge of the political history of the early empire, which is only scantily filled by inferior chronicles such as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', inscriptions and other evidence}} The Bastarnae may have been involved in the Dacian Wars of [[Domitian]] (86-88) and [[Trajan]] (101-102 and 105-106), since these took place in the lower Danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes.{{original research inline|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn the late 2nd century, the ''Historia Augusta'' mentions that in the rule of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-80), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the [[Costoboci]] took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper Danube (the [[Marcomannic Wars]]) to invade Roman territory.<ref>Historia Augusta ''Marcus Aurelius'' II.22</ref>\n\n==== 3rd century ====\nDuring the late 2nd century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the [[Goths]] and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the [[Taifali]] and the [[Hasdingi]], a branch of the [[Vandal]] people. This migration was part of a series of major population movements in the European ''barbaricum'' (the Roman term for regions outside their empire). The Goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Goths, a series of major invasions of the Roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from c. 238 onwards. The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus' and other chroniclers' tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term \"Scythians\" - meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific [[Iranic languages|Iranic]]-speaking people called the [[Scythians]].<ref>Wolfram (1988) 45</ref> Thus, in 250-1, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Abrittus]] and the slaying of the emperor [[Decius]] (251).<ref>Wolfram (1988) 45-46</ref> This disaster was the start of the [[Third Century Crisis]] of the Roman empire, a period of military and economic chaos. At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the [[plague of Cyprian]] (251-70). The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier [[Antonine Plague|Antonine plague]] (166-80), which probably killed 15-30% of the empire's inhabitants.<ref>Zosimus I.16, 21</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of Roman military disarray, a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire. The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253-8 and 260-8.<ref>Zosimus I.16, 20, 21</ref> The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/8 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river ''Tyras'' ([[Dnieper]]). The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked. The barbarians sailed along the [[Black Sea]] coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success. They then attacked the provincial capital [[Marcianopolis]] (Devnya, Bulg.), also in vain. Sailing on through the [[Bosporus]], the expedition laid siege to [[Thessalonica]] in Macedonia. Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by emperor [[Claudius II]] (r. 268-70) at [[Battle of Naissus|Naissus]] (269).<ref>Zosimus I.22-3</ref>\n\nClaudius II was the first of a sequence of military emperors (the so-called \"[[Illyrian emperors]]\" from their main ethnic origin) who restored order in the empire in the late 3rd century. These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. But it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire. In the 4th century, such communities were known as ''[[laeti]]''.<ref>Jones (1964) 620</ref>\n\nThe emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] (r. 276-82) is recorded as resettling 100,000 Bastarnae in Moesia, in addition to other peoples (Goths, Gepids and Vandals). The Bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor, while the other resettled peoples mutinied while Probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the Danubian provinces far and wide.<ref name=\"Zosimus I.34\"/><ref>Historia Augusta ''Probus'' 18</ref> A further massive transfer of Bastarnae was carried out by emperor [[Diocletian]] (ruled 284-305) after he and his colleague [[Galerius]] defeated a coalition of Bastarnae and [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]] in 299.<ref>Eutropius IX.25</ref>\n\n=== Later Roman empire (AD 305 onwards) ===\n\nThe remaining transdanubian Bastarnae disappear into historical obscurity in the late empire. Neither of the main ancient sources for this period, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Zosimus]], mention the Bastarnae in their accounts of the 4th century, possibly implying the loss of their separate identity, presumably assimilated by the regional hegemons, the Goths. Such assimilation would have been facilitated if, as is possible, the Bastarnae spoke an [[East Germanic]] language closely related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. If the Bastarnae remained an identifiable group, it is highly likely that they participated in the vast Gothic-led migration, driven by [[Hun]]nic pressure, that was admitted into Moesia by emperor [[Valens]] in 376 and eventually defeated and killed Valens at [[Battle of Adrianople|Adrianople]] in 378. Although Ammianus refers to the migrants collectively as \"Goths\", he states that, in addition, \"Taifali and other tribes\" were involved.<ref>Zosimus IV.104-7; 107</ref>\n\nHowever, after a gap of 150 years, there is a final mention of Bastarnae in the mid-5th century. In 451, the [[Hun]]nic leader [[Attila]] invaded Gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] by a Roman-led coalition under the general [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]].<ref>Jordanes 38-40</ref> Attila's host, according to [[Jordanes]], included contingents from the \"innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway.\"<ref>Jordanes 38</ref> One such were the Bastarnae, according to the Gallic nobleman [[Sidonius Apollinaris]].<ref>Sidonius ''Carmina'' 7.341</ref> However, E.A. Thompson argues that Sidonius' mention of Bastarnae at Chalons is probably false: his purpose was to write a [[panegyric]] and not a history, and Sidonius added some spurious names to the list of real participants (e.g. [[Burgundians]], [[Scirii|Sciri]] and [[Franks]]) for dramatic effect.<ref name=\"Thompson 1996 149\">Thompson (1996) 149</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[List of Celtic tribes]]\n* [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)]]\n* [[Dacians]]\n* [[Early Slavs]]\n* [[Goths]]\n* [[Sarmatians]]\n* [[Slavs]]\n* [[ Dardanian-Bastarnae war]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist |group=Note}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Ancient ===\n* ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' (c.

To the south, over the Danube, the Romans extended their empire, and to the southeast in Hungaria, were [[Dacians|Dacian]] peoples.\n\nIn the area of modern Bohemia the [[Marcomanni]] and other Suebic groups were led by their king [[Marobodus]], after suffering defeat to Roman forces in Germany. He took advantage of the natural defenses provided by its mountains and forests. They were able to maintain a strong alliance with neighbouring tribes including (at different times) the [[Lugii]], [[Quadi]], [[Hermunduri]], [[Semnones]], and [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], which was sometimes partly controlled by the [[Roman Empire]], and sometimes in conflict with it, for example in the second century when they fought [[Marcus Aurelius]].\n\nIn late classical times and the early [[Middle Ages]], two new Suebic groupings appeared to the west of Bohemia in southern Germany, the [[Alemanni]] (in the Helvetian desert), and the Bavarians ([[Baiuvarii]]). Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal. With them were also tribes who had pushed from the east, such as the [[Vandals]], and [[Alans]].\n\nOther groups pushed southwards towards [[Pannonia]]. The last known mention of the kingdom of the Marcomanni, concerning a queen named [[Fritigil]] is in the 4th century, and she was thought to have lived in or near Pannonia. The Suebian [[Langobardi]], who moved over many generations from the [[Baltic Sea]], via the Elbe and Pannonia to Italy, recorded in a [[Origo Gentis Langobardorum|tribal history]] a time spent in \"Bainaib\".\n\nAfter this [[migration period]], Bohemia was partially repopulated around the 6th century, and eventually [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes arrived from the east, and their language began to replace the older Germanic, Celtic and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] ones. These are precursors of today's [[Czech people|Czechs]], though the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate.  The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic [[Lombards]] left Bohemia (c. 568 AD). Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by [[Samo]]'s tribal confederation. His death marked the end of the old \"Slavonic\" confederation, the second attempt to establish such a Slavonic union after [[Carantania]] in [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]].\n\nOther sources (''[[Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii]]'', Bavaria, 800\u2013850) divide the population of Bohemia at this time into the Merehani, Marharaii, Beheimare (Bohemani) and Fraganeo. (The suffix ''-ani'' or ''-ni'' means \"people of-\"). Christianity first appeared in the early 9th century, but only became dominant much later, in the 10th or 11th century.\n\nThe 9th century was crucial for the future of Bohemia. The [[Manorialism|manorial system]] sharply declined, as it did in Bavaria. The influence of the central ''Fraganeo-Czechs'' grew, as a result of the important cultic centre in their territory. They were Slavic-speaking and thus contributed to the transformation of diverse neighbouring populations into a new nation named and led by them with a united ''slavic'' ethnic consciousness.<ref>Petr Charv\u00e1t: \"Zrod \u010cesk\u00e9ho st\u00e1tu\" [Origin of the Bohemian State], March 2007, {{ISBN|80-7021-845-2}}, in Czech</ref>\n\n===P\u0159emysl dynasty===\n{{main|History of Bohemia in the High Middle Ages}}\n[[File:P\u0159emyslovci erb.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] (until 1253-62).]]\n\nBohemia was made a part of the early Slavic state of [[Great Moravia]], under the rule of [[Svatopluk I]] (r. 870\u2013894). After Svatopluk's death Great Moravia was weakened by years of internal conflict and constant warfare, ultimately collapsing and fragmenting due to the continual incursions of the invading nomadic [[Magyars]]. Bohemia's initial incorporation into the Moravian Empire resulted in the extensive [[Christianization of Bohemia|Christianization of the population]]. A native monarchy arose to the throne, and Bohemia came under the rule of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], which would rule the Czech lands for the next several hundred years.\n\nThe P\u0159emyslids secured their frontiers from the remnant Asian interlocurs, after the collapse of the Moravian state, by entering into a state of semi-vassalage to the Frankish rulers. This alliance was facilitated by Bohemia's conversion to Christianity, in the 9th century. Continuing close relations were developed with the East [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom, which devolved from the [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Empire, into [[East Francia]], eventually becoming the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nAfter a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955 [[Battle of Lechfeld]], [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]] of Bohemia was granted the [[March of Moravia]] by German emperor [[Otto the Great]]. Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades. The jurisdiction of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was definitively reasserted when [[Jaromir, Duke of Bohemia|Jarom\u00edr of Bohemia]] was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry II]] of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004,  ending the rule of [[Boleslaw I of Poland]].\n\nThe first to use the title of \"King of Bohemia\" were the P\u0159emyslid dukes [[Vratislav II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] (1085) and [[Vladislav II of Bohemia|Vladislav II]] (1158), but their heirs would return to the title of [[duke]]. The title of king became hereditary under [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (1198). His grandson [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] (king from 1253\u20131278) conquered a short-lived empire which contained modern [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]]. The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1241. Germans settled primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom.\n{{-}}\n\n===Luxembourg dynasty===\n[[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.png|thumb|The coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia.]]\nThe [[House of Luxembourg]] accepted the invitation to the Bohemian throne with the marriage to the Premyslid heiress, Elizabeth and the crowning subsequent of [[John I of Bohemia]] in 1310. His son, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] became King of Bohemia in 1346. He founded [[Charles University in Prague]], central Europe's first university, two years later.\n\nHis reign brought Bohemia to its peak both politically and in total area, resulting in his being the first King of Bohemia to also be elected as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Under his rule the [[Bohemian crown]] controlled such diverse lands as [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper Lusatia]] and [[Lower Lusatia]], Brandenburg, an area around [[Nuremberg]] called New Bohemia, [[Luxembourg]], and several small towns scattered around Germany.\n\n===Hussite Bohemia===\n[[File:Tabor CZ aerial old town from north B1.jpg|thumb|The more extreme Hussites became known as [[Taborite]]s, after the city of [[T\u00e1bor]] that became their center.]]\nDuring the ecumenical [[Council of Constance]] in 1415, [[Jan Hus]], the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Charles University and a prominent reformer and religious thinker, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake as a [[Heresy|heretic]]. The verdict was passed despite the fact that Hus was granted formal protection by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] prior to the journey. Hus was invited to attend the council to defend himself and the Czech positions in the religious court, but with the emperor's approval, he was executed on 6 July 1415. The execution of Hus, as well as five consecutive papal [[crusades]] against followers of Hus, forced the Bohemians to defend themselves in the [[Hussite Wars]].\n\nThe uprising against imperial forces was led by a former mercenary, [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]] of Trocnov. As the leader of the Hussite armies, he used innovative tactics and weapons, such as howitzers, pistols, and fortified wagons, which were revolutionary for the time, and established \u017di\u017eka as a great general who never lost a battle.\n\nAfter \u017di\u017eka's death, [[Prokop the Great]] took over the command for the army, and under his lead the Hussites were victorious for another ten years, to the sheer terror of Europe. The Hussite cause gradually splintered into two main factions, the moderate [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] and the more fanatic [[Taborite]]s. The [[Utraquists]] began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful. Additionally, with general [[war-weariness]] and yearning for order, the Utraquists were able to eventually defeat the Taborites in the [[Battle of Lipany]] in 1434. Sigismund said after the battle that \"only the Bohemians could defeat the Bohemians.\"\n\nDespite an apparent victory for the Catholics, the Bohemian Utraquists were still strong enough to negotiate [[freedom of religion]] in 1436. This happened in the so-called [[Compacts of Basel|Basel Compacts]], declaring peace and freedom between Catholics and Utraquists. It would only last for a short period of time, as [[Pope Pius II]] declared the Basel Compacts to be invalid in 1462.\n\nIn 1458, [[George of Podebrady]] was elected to ascend to the Bohemian throne. He is remembered for his attempt to set up a pan-European \"Christian League\", which would form all the states of Europe into a community based on religion. In the process of negotiating, he appointed [[Leo of Rozmital]] to tour the European courts and to conduct the talks. However, the negotiations were not completed, because George's position was substantially damaged over time by his deteriorating relationship with the Pope.\n\n===Habsburg Monarchy===<!--'Habsburg Bohemia' redirects here-->\n{{Main|History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648\u20131867)}}\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Bohemia as the heart of ''[[Europa regina]]'', 1570.]]\nAfter the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] became the new King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\nBohemia enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period. In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], who made Prague again the capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish ''Maiestas Rudolphina'', which confirmed the older ''Confessio Bohemica'' of 1575.\n\nAfter Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II]] and then King of Bohemia [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] (later Holy Roman Emperor) began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting [[Bohemian Revolt]] led to outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618. Elector [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], a [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]], was elected by the Bohemian nobility to replace Ferdinand on the Bohemian throne, and was known as the [[Winter King]]. Frederick's wife, the popular [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]] and subsequently Elizabeth of Bohemia, known as the Winter Queen or Queen of Hearts, was the daughter of King [[James VI of Scotland]].\n\nAfter Frederick's defeat in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, 27 Bohemian estates leaders together with [[Jan Jesenius]], rector of the [[Charles University]] of Prague were executed on the Prague's Old Town Square on 21 June 1621 and the rest were exiled from the country; their lands were then given to Catholic loyalists (mostly of Bavarian and Saxon origin), this ended the pro-reformation movement in Bohemia and also ended the role of Prague as ruling city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the so-called \"renewed constitution\"<!--description needed--> of 1627, the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. The Czech language formally remained the first language in the kingdom, however, both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes, although German became increasingly dominant, while Czech was spoken in much of the countryside.\n\nThe formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] approved administrative reform in 1749. It included the indivisibility of the [[Habsburg Monarchy#Rulers of the Habsburg Monarchy, 1526\u20131918|Habsburg Empire]] and the centralization of rule; this essentially meant the merging of the Royal Bohemian Chancellery with the Austrian Chancellery.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the [[Czech National Revival]] movement, in cooperation with part of the Bohemian aristocracy, started a campaign for restoration of the kingdom's historic rights, whereby the Czech language was to regain its historical role and replace German as the language of administration. The [[enlightened absolutism]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who introduced minor language concessions, showed promise for the Czech movement, but many of these reforms were later rescinded. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of 1848]], many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as [[romantic nationalism]] developed among the Czechs.\n\nIn 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown ([[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[Margraviate of Moravia]], and [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]]) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy (\"state rights program\"), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called \"Verfassungstreue\").\n\nAfter the defeat of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy (Austria-Hungary-Bohemia) failed in 1871. The \"state rights program\" remained the official platform of all Czech political parties (except for social democrats) until 1918.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Bohemia (westernmost area) in Czechoslovakia 1918-1938.]]\n[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Bohemia (as the largest and most populous land) became the core of the newly formed country of [[Czechoslovakia]], which combined Bohemia, [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia]], [[Upper Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]) and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] into one state. Under its first president, [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk]], Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majority's relationship with the native [[Sudeten Germans|German]] and Hungarian minorities.\n\nFollowing the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans (the [[Sudetenland]]) were annexed to [[Nazi Germany]]. This was the only time in Bohemian history that its territory was politically divided. The remnants of Bohemia and Moravia were then annexed by Germany in 1939, while the Slovak lands became the separate [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]], a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]]. From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia, (without the Sudetenland), together with Moravia formed the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (''Reichsprotektorat B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren'').\n\nAny open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result. After [[World War II]] ended in 1945, the vast majority of remaining Germans were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II|expelled]] by force by the order of the re-established Czechoslovak central government, based on the Potsdam Agreement, and their property was confiscated by the Czech authorities. This severely depopulated the area and from this moment on locales were only referred to in their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup.\n\nThe Communist Party won the most votes in free elections but not a [[majority|simple majority]]. [[Klement Gottwald]], the communist leader, became Prime Minister of a coalition government.\n[[File:Karlovy Vary Czech Rep.jpg|thumb|right|Bohemian town [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]].]]\nIn February 1948 the non-communist members of the government resigned in protest against arbitrary measures by the communists and their Soviet protectors in many of the state's institutions. Gottwald and the communists responded with a coup d'\u00e9tat and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state. In 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions that did not follow the historical borders.\n\nIn 1989, [[Agnes of Bohemia]] became the first saint from a [[Central Europe]]an country to be canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] before the \"[[Velvet Revolution]]\" later that year.\n\nAfter the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993, the territory of Bohemia remained in the [[Czech Republic]]. The new [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] provided for higher administrative units to be established, providing for the possibility of Bohemia as an administrative unit, but did not specify the form they would take. A constitutional act in 1997 rejected the restoration of self-governing historical Czech lands and decided for the regional system that has been in use since 2000.<ref name=const2>{{cite web|url=https://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&nr=347~2F1997&rpp=15#local-content|title=Port\u00e1l ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 spr\u00e1vy|website=portal.gov.cz}}</ref> [[Petr Pithart]], former Czech prime minister and president of the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]] at the time, remained one of the main advocates of the land system,<ref name=\"odvaha\">Petr Z\u00eddek: [http://www.lidovky.cz/dnesnim-politikum-chybi-odvaha-tvrdi-petr-pithart-z-uprchliku-strach-nema-1tj-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A151017_130833_ln_domov_mct Dne\u0161n\u00edm politik\u016fm chyb\u00ed odvaha, tvrd\u00ed Petr Pithart.

Pressure brought on by the [[Soviet Union]] led to a ceasing of military operations, with the Czech minority being expelled to [[Germany]] and Czechoslovakia.

Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7 pm, including electronica, dance, hip hop, rock and indie. The choice of music and presenting style is entirely that of programme hosts, however those who present in the daytime have to rotate a number of songs a specific number of times (8, 13 or 15) per week. It was launched in 1967 to meet the demand for music generated by [[pirate radio]] stations, when the average age of the UK population was 27.<ref>[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html \"Annual Population Survey\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210042804/http://ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html|date=10 December 2013}}.

Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], which had been outlawed by [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Act of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/index.html|title=The Unofficial History of BBC Radio 1 & 2|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Radio 1 was launched at 6:55{{nbsp}}am on Saturday 30 September 1967.\n\nBroadcasts were on 247 metres (1215&nbsp;kHz) medium wave, using a network of transmitters which had carried the Light Programme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA43&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The British Radio Scene: a Special Report|last=Scott|first=Robin|date=8 June 1968|work=Billboard|access-date=1 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=43|author-link=Robin Scott (BBC controller)}}</ref> Most were of comparatively low power, at less than 50 kilowatts, leading to patchy coverage of the country.\n\nThe first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was [[Tony Blackburn]], whose cheery style, first heard on [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], won him the prime slot on what became known as the \"Radio 1 Breakfast Show\". The first words on Radio 1 \u2013 after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, [[Robin Scott (BBC controller)|Robin Scott]], and a jingle, recorded at [[PAMS]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], beginning \"The voice of Radio 1\" \u2013 were:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n{{quote|And, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1. | BBC Radio 1 opening message}}\n\nThis was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The reason jingles from PAMS were used was that the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] would not agree to a single fee for the singers and musicians if the jingles were made \"in-house\" by the BBC; they wanted repeat fees each time one was played.\n\nThe first music to be heard on the station was \"Theme One\", specially composed for the launch by [[George Martin]]. It was followed by an extract from \"Beefeaters\" by [[Johnny Dankworth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41414837|title=50 facts about Radio 1 & 2 as they turn 50|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=22 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The first complete record played on Radio 1 was \"[[Flowers in the Rain]]\" by [[The Move]], the number 2 record in that week's Top 20 (the number 1 record by Englebert Humperdink would have been inappropriate for the station's sound). The second single was \"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\" by [[Bee Gees|The Bee Gees]]. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/radio_1_launch_day.htm|title=History \u2013 Launch day 1967|publisher=Radio Rewind|date=30 September 1967|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe initial rota of staff included [[John Peel]] and a gaggle of others, some transferred from pirate stations, such as [[Keith Skues]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Mike Raven]], David Ryder, Jim Fisher, [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]], [[Dave Cash (DJ)|Dave Cash]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Simon Dee]], [[Terry Wogan]], [[Duncan Johnson]], Doug Crawford, [[Tommy Vance]], [[Chris Denning]], [[Emperor Rosko]], [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]], and [[Bob Holness]].

Firstly, Radio 1. They outlawed the pirates and then didn't, as they promised, cater for the market the pirates created. Radio 1 and 2, most afternoons, run concurrently and the whole thing has slid right back to where it was before the pirates happened. They've totally fucked it. There's no radio station for young people any more. It's all down to housewives and trendies in Islington. They're killing the country by having that play list monopoly.\n | source = \u2014[[Joe Strummer]]{{sfn|Coon|1977}}\n | width  = 34%\n | align  = right\n | salign = right\n}}\nInitially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]] being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an \"establishment\" institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.\n\nDespite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The touring summer live broadcasts called the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] \u2013 usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road \u2013 drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973, took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk). [[Alan Freeman]]'s 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.\n\n[[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm|title=BBC Radio 1 People \u2013 Annie Nightingale \u2013 Hi|date=|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 23 November 1978 the station moved to two new medium wave frequencies (275m and 285m) which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved coverage of the UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early 80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency for a number of hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and after a number of years of parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.\n\n===1990s changes===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these \"[[Loud'n'proud]]\" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime [[playlist]].\n\nMany listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the \"Radio 1 and a half\" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.\n\nAfter the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] \u2013 [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zo\u00eb Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s \u2013 bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's \"Lost in Music\" which looked at the influence that the use of [[drugs]] have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].\n\nLater in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]].\n\n===2000s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe]]\n\nListening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery with Aled]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]], ''The Evening Session'' with [[Steve Lamacq]] and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]. Its website has also been well received.\nHowever, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zo\u00eb Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and it increased its audience, ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time \u2013 Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.\nThe chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which was broadcast at the same time.\n\nMany DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.\nThe success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.\nA new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows.\nFollowing the death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.\n\n===2010s===\nThe licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\">{{cite news|first=Amanda|last=Andrews|date=28 November 2010|title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 March 2011|location=London}}</ref> His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\"<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\"/>\n\nThe controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt.

This included the departure of Reggie Yates and Vernon Kay. Jameela Jamil was announced as the new presenter of ''The Official Chart''. Matt Edmondson moved to weekend mornings with Tom Deacon briefly replacing him on Wednesday nights. [[Dan Howell]] and [[Phil Lester]], famous [[YouTubers]] and video bloggers, joined the station.

Adele Roberts also joined the weekday schedule line-up, hosting the Early Breakfast show.\n\nIn July 2015, The Official Chart moved to a Friday from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 5:45{{nbsp}}pm, hosted by Greg James. The move took place in order to take into account the changes to the release dates of music globally. Cel Spellman joined Radio 1 to host Sunday evenings\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Nick Grimshaw would leave the Breakfast Show after six years, the second longest run hosting the show in history (only second to Chris Moyles). However, Grimshaw is not leaving the station, but swapping slots with Greg James, who normally hosts the home time show from 4-7pm weekdays. This change took place as of 20 August 2018.\n\n==Broadcast==\n===Studios===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Radio One Studio.png|thumb|alt=Scott Mills Recording his show in the BBC Radio 1 Studios.|right|Scott Mills presenting his show at Radio 1 HQ.]] -->\nFrom inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.\n\nIn 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from [[Broadcasting House]] to [[Egton House]]. The station moved to [[Yalding House]] in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.\n\nUntil recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in [[central London]]. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the \"[[Live Lounge]]\", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as [[Maida Vale Studios]] is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the \"Live Lounge\", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the \"Live Cam\". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.\n\nIn December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]], Portland Place, just a few metres away from the \"Peel Wing\", formerly the \"Egton Wing\", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the \"Peel Wing\" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, [[John Peel]], who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.\n\nProgrammes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably ''The Mark and Lard Show'', broadcast every weekday from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993 \u2013 March 2004) \u2014 the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.\n\n===UK analogue frequencies===\nRadio 1 originally broadcast on 1214&nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053 and 1089&nbsp;kHz (275 and 285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week. These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening \u2013 most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10{{nbsp}}pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show (Mon\u2013Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of [[5 live Sport|Sport on 2]].\n\nTo coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast began in the London area on 31 October 1987, at low power on 104.8&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg|title=Plans for Radio 1 FM services introduction|publisher=Radiorewind.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97\u201399 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.\n\nThe Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to [[Independent National Radio]]. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s \"Kiss Me\" being the last record played on MW just before 9{{nbsp}}am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9{{nbsp}}am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with [[Mark Goodier]] was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an \"FM-only\" station.<ref name=\"Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|title=Radio 1 History \u2013 Transmitters|publisher=Radio Rewind|date=|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).\n\n===Digital distribution===\nThe BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was \"officially\" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6 million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.\nBBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.\n\n===SiriusXM cancellation in North America===\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2012}}\nAt midnight on 9 August 2011, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning. On 10 August 2011 the BBC issued the following statement:\n<blockquote>The BBC\u2019s commercial arm BBC Worldwide has been in partnership with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio 1 on their main network, since 2005.

The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform.\n\n===Regionalisation===<!-- This section is linked from [[BBC Northern Ireland]] -->\nFrom 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the [[home nations]] for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent. Most recently, these shows were under the [[BBC Introducing]] brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.\n\nFrom January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592r |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Scotland with Ally McCrae |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously it was hosted by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.\n\nWales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592p |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Wales with Jen Long |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously [[Bethan Elfyn]] occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,<ref name=\"regions98\">{{cite web|url=http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |title=Frequency Finder UK \u2013 Classic Radio 1 schedules |publisher=Frequencyfinder.org.uk |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111133603/http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales - a Welsh-language music show on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] on Thursday evenings)\n\nPhil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by [[Rory McConnell]]. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on the Session in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;<ref name=\"regions98\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |title=Who is Colin Murray? |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110024216/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |archivedate=10 November 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.\n\nThe regional opt-outs originally went out from 8{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm on Thursdays (the Evening Session's time slot) and were known as the Session in the Nations (the 'Session' tag was later dropped due to the demise of the Evening Session); they later moved to run from 7:30{{nbsp}}pm to 9{{nbsp}}pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am under the ''BBC Introducing'' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.\n\nThe opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.\n\nThe [[BBC Trust]] announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=BBC News \u2013 Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single ''BBC Introducing'' show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jk7zb |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing with Jen and Ally |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n===Music===\nBecause of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Dance music|dance]]/[[electronica]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. This made the station stand out from other [[contemporary hit radio|top 40]] stations, both in the UK and across the world.\n\nDue to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the \"[[needle time]]\" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for [[John Peel]]'s late night programme are particularly renowned.\n\nThe station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for \"waffling\" by presenters, an experimental \"more music day\" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.\n\n===News and current affairs===\n{{Main|Newsbeat}}\nRadio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Shared with [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two 15-minute bulletins at 12:45{{nbsp}}pm and 5:45{{nbsp}}pm on weekdays. The main presenter is Chris Smith, with [[Tina Daheley]] presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.\n\n===Online visualisation and social media===\nIn recent years Radio 1 has utilised [[social media]] to help reach a younger audience. Its [[YouTube]] channel now has over 5 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/bbcradio1|title = BBC Radio 1 \u2013 YouTube|date = |accessdate = 24 July 2018|website = BBC Radio 1 \u2013 YouTube|publisher = |last = |first = }}\n</ref> The highest viewed videos on the channel are predominately live music performances from the [[Live Lounge]].\n\nThe station also has a heavy presence on social media, with audience interaction occurring through [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] as well as [[Short Message Service|text messaging]].\n\nIt was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the [[BBC iPlayer]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/radio-1-channel.html|title = BBC Media Centre|date = 7 October 2013|accessdate = |website = Radio 1 to have own channel on BBC iPlayer|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}\n</ref> where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location.

The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)\u2019 after already breaking [[Simon Mayo]]'s 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.\n\nThe presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30{{nbsp}}am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over \u00a32,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the \u00a32,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10{{nbsp}}am and 10:30{{nbsp}}am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.\n\nIn total the event raised \u00a32,622,421 for Comic Relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/longestshow/ |title=Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Drama====\nIn 1981, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the [[space opera]] film, ''[[Star Wars (radio)|Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: A Wind to Shake the Stars \u2013 BBC Radio 1 England \u2013 4 July 1981 \u2013 BBC Genome|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/deeb365665eb44a0867f3dd085a0f9d7|website=Radio Times Archive: BBC Radio 1|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=1 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029205244/http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/deeb365665eb44a0867f3dd085a0f9d7 |archivedate=29 October 2014|date=4 July 1981|deadurl=no}}</ref> The 13-episode serial was adapted for radio by the author [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], and was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the BBC and the American Broadcaster [[NPR]].<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief Guide to Star Wars|date=2012|publisher=Hachette |location=London|isbn=9781780335834|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l-eBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT76&dq=star%20wars%20national%20public%20radio&pg=PT76#v=onepage&q=star%20wars%20national%20public%20radio&f=false|accessdate=21 July 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the ''Batman'' comic book storyline Knightfall, as part of the Marc Goodier show, featuring [[Michael Gough]] recreating his movie role as Alfred.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Goodier - BBC Radio 1 England - 11 April 1994 - BBC Genome|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=26 June 2018|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/076ac40cab8e4ababfb52c9423955ef8}}</ref> Later that same year, Radio 1 also broadcast a re-edited version of the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] Superman radio drama.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claire Sturgess = BBC Radio 1 England - 18 July 1994 14.00 - BBC Genome|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=26 June 2018|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/25e12b7183bc4d938d4efdb2c724c413}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n===Radio 1 Roadshows===\nThe [[Radio 1 Roadshow]], which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/roadshow.htm|title=Radio Rewind \u2013 Radio 1 Shows \u2013 Roadshow; the early years|publisher=}}</ref> hosted by [[Alan Freeman]] in [[Newquay]], [[Cornwall]], with the final one held at [[Heaton Park]], [[Manchester]] in 1999.

Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nThe most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington|Herrington Country Park]], [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]\u2013which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage\u2013[[Mote Park]], [[Lydiard Park]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Airport]].\n\nTickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218203420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/| archivedate= 18 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23\u201324 June 2012 in [[Hackney Marshes]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London]]. The event was to celebrate the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]] in London and had artists such as [[Rihanna]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Florence and the Machine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/events/hackneyweekend2012 |title=Radio 1's Hackney Weekend 2012 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Radio 1's Big Weekend returned to [[Derry]] as part of the City of Culture 2013 celebrations. So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.\n\nIn May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. Acts which played at the event included [[Rita Ora]], [[The 1975]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Jake Bugg]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]. The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in [[George Square]], featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as [[Danny Howard]] and [[Pete Tong]], and other well-known acts such as [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Ti\u00ebsto|Tiesto]].\n\nIn 2015, the event was held in [[Norwich]] and featured performances from the likes of [[Taylor Swift]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[David Guetta]], [[Years & Years]] and others.\n\n2016 saw the event make its way to [[Exeter]]. It was headlined by [[Coldplay]] who closed the weekend on the Sunday evening.\n\nThe event was in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 2017 and saw performances by artists such as [[Zara Larsson]], [[Shawn Mendes]], [[Stormzy]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Little Mix]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Rita Ora]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Clean Bandit]] and [[Kings Of Leon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/eppp6q/performances|title=Radio 1's Big Weekend 2017|website=BBC Music Events|accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 to take advantage of [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s fallow year, 4 separate Big Weekends were held simultaneously between 25 and 28 May. Stylized as \"BBC Music's Biggest Weekend\", events were held in [[Swansea]] (with a line-up curated by Radio 1), [[Coventry]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (both curated by Radio 2) and [[Belfast]] (curated by Radio 6). Tickets sold out for the Swansea, Perth and Coventry Big Weekends.\n\n===Ibiza Weekend===\nRadio 1 has annually held a dance music weekend broadcast live from [[Ibiza]] since the 1990s. The weekend is usually the first weekend in August and has performances from world-famous DJs and Radio 1's own dance music talent such as [[Pete Tong]] and [[Annie Mac]].\n\n===BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards===\nSince 2008 Radio 1 has held an annual event for teenagers aged 14 to 17 years. Originally named [[BBC Switch]] Live, the first event was held on 12 October 2008 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. The event has been hosted by various Radio 1 DJs and guest co-hosts.\n\nIn 2010 the event was renamed 'BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards', and includes awards given to celebrities and particularly inspirational young people. Now hosted at [[Wembley Arena]], the event has included guests such as [[One Direction]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Jessie J]].\n\nThe 2014 event took place on 19 October and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Rita Ora]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ec8mxj|title=BBC \u2013 Radio 1's Teen Awards 2014 \u2013 event \u2013 Radio 1|work=BBC Music Events}}</ref>\n\nThe 2015 event took place on 8 November and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Demi Lovato]] at [[Wembley Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144p0z|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\nThe 2016 event took place on 23 October and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Dua Lipa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e4xxj5 |title=Radio 1's Teen Awards 2016 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 event took place on 22 October and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Rita Ora]].\n\nThe 2018 event took place on 21 October and was hosted by Greg James, Mollie King, and Maya Jama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4fbfMwBkT2xnSm7Fh22BH5T/teen-awards-2018|title=2018, BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards - Teen Awards 2018 - BBC Radio 1|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Edinburgh Festival===\nRadio 1 often has a presence at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

The services replaced [[Ceefax]], the BBC's analogue [[teletext]] service. The service can be accessed via [[Digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) ([[DVB-T]]), satellite television ([[DVB-S]]) and cable television ([[DVB-C]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Red Button - How to use|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/redbutton_use|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History and branding==\nThe service was launched in September 1999 as BBC Text. It was relaunched in November 2001 under the '''BBCi''' brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button. The \"red button\" name refers to the common interface on [[remote control]]s for digital televisions and [[set-top box]]es, a red [[push-button]] which launches digital teletext services.\n\nAlthough initially marketed as a spectacular new form of television, by 2008 this had given way to positioning iTV as \u2018everyday\u2019. This was due in part to the institutional landscape of television in the UK.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=James|title='Your Window-on-the-World' : The Emergence of Red-Button Interactive Television in the UK|journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|year=2008|volume=14|issue=2|page=161|doi=10.1177/1354856507087942}}</ref>\n\n===BBC Text (1999\u20132001)===\nBBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services in September 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms. In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax. A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes.\n<ref name=\"RDreview2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/rev_00/bbcrdar00part3.pdf|title=Digital Broadcasting \u2013 BBC R&D Annual Review 1999\u20132000|year=2000|publisher=BBC Research & Development|pages=49\u201350|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nBBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour). BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay (i.e. opaque blocks of colour on top of the television channel, with the black background now transparent; not 'translucent blocks of colour with a translucent black background') above the television picture. The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases.\n\nBBC Text pioneered an early form of \"[[Video on demand|on-demand]]\" [[interactive television]], called Enhanced TV. During the [[1999 Wimbledon Championships]], the BBC presented a service which allowed viewers to select a video stream of different matches, and access additional information such as player profiles, scores and interactive quizzes. Although the experimental service was publicly available, there were no digital set-top boxes or receivers available on the market which could decode the signal and the service was only presented to the public via BBC demonstrations using prototype receivers.<ref name=\"RDreview2000\"/>\n\n===The BBCi brand (2001\u20132008)===\n[[File:BBCi-bar TV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi TV i-bar, 2001]]\n[[File:Bbci website jan 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi website navbar, 2004]]\nThe BBCi brand launched in November 2001 and was conceived as a cohesive [[cross-platform|multi-platform]] brand name for all the BBC's digital interactive services, encompassing the corporation's digital teletext, interactive television and website services.<ref name=\"bbcsnews0711\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1643259.stm|title=BBCi heralds new interactive era|date=7 November 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"whatisBBCi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/|title=What is BBCi?|date=15 December 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011215000308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/ |archivedate=15 December 2001}}</ref> According to the BBC, the \"i\" in BBCi stood for \"interactivity\" as well as \"innovation\".<ref name=\"guardian1101\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/12/mondaymediasection.bbc1|title=A fresh i for BBC|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=12 November 2001|work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe various services all took on a common interface device, an \"i-bar\" branded with the BBCi logo, which sought to emphasise the brand across different technologies by providing similar navigation. For example, the [[BBC Online|BBC website]], which had previously been called BBC Online, took on the BBCi brand from 2001, displaying an i-bar across the top of every page, offering a category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index, and a search.<ref name=\"wwwibar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/on_web.shtml|title=What is BBCi? \u2013 On the web|date=15 December 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011215101431/http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/on_web.shtml |archivedate=15 December 2001}}</ref> Similarly, BBC interactive television services all offered a horizontal i-bar along the bottom of television screens, with four colour-coded interactions linked to the four colour buttons on TV remote controls.\n\nAfter three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed [[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]], after the main [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] used to access the site.<ref name=\"bbccouk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/04/bbc_co_uk.shtml|title=BBC website gets new look and new name: bbc.co.uk|date=4 May 2004|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=30 September 2008}}</ref> Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until late 2008.\n\nToday, the broadcaster's online video player, the [[BBC iPlayer]], reflects the branding legacy by retaining an i-prefix in its branding.\n\n===BBC Red Button HD (2013 to 2018)===\n\nIn June 2013, a HD version of BBC Red Button was launched for the summertime. It closed on 25 November 2013 after the 50 anniversary of [[Doctor Who]]. It returned each year along with the other BBC Red Button channels as a temporary channel for the duration of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis tournament. On 26 March 2018, [[CBBC HD]] began its downtime and the relaunch of BBC Red Button HD took place to cover the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]]. It was added on Sky on channel 981 and Freeview channel 602 on 3 April 2018 and closed on 16 April 2018 after the Games had concluded.\n\n===The BBC Red Button brand (2008)===\nFrom 2008, the BBC gradually began to drop the BBCi name from its digital interactive TV services also, replacing it with the name BBC Red Button. The BBCi logo continued in on-screen presentation for some time.\n\nIn November 2008, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service.<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/06/button.shtml|title=BBC's Red Button celebrates its 10th anniversary|date=6 November 2008|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===BBC Connected Red Button (2012)===\nBBC Connected Red Button launched in December 2012 on Virgin TiVo and on some Freeview and Freesat 'Smart TVs' in December 2013.

It is also available in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through [[Sky Ireland|Sky]]. On Freeview interactivity does not permit users to submit data (such as answering questions in a quiz or requesting [[video on demand]]), as the platform does not provide a [[bounce address|return path]]. BBC Red Button currently provides one video stream to all platforms, which can be accessed directly from Freeview channel 601, Freesat channel 981, Sky channel 980 and Virgin Media channel 991, however the feed is standard definition only. One advantage of the feed is the DVR ability as the conventional Red Button interaction restricts DVR record / pause / rewind functions, and is a major caveat for many. It is currently unknown if the BBC plans to re-introduce a permanent high-definition service of the direct channel feed, but until they do, viewers will continue to move to rival satellite services for high-definition broadcasts of live sporting events such as tennis, cycling and snooker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/2014/11/BBC-Red-Button-channel-numbers.html |title=BBC Red Button: channel guide |publisher=a516digital |date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> The BBC does have the ability to increase the amount of streams during major events and has done so on numerous occasions, as follows:\n\n:*[[2012 Olympics]]: For the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and with it being a home games in [[London]] for the BBC, the BBC provided 24 live streams in standard and high-definition for the duration of the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18071080 |title=London 2012: BBC launches 'Digital Olympics' coverage |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Additional online streams could also be accessed through the internet-connected BBC Red Button+.\n:*[[2016 Olympics]]: eight red button video streams were broadcast to all platforms during the [[2016 Olympics]].

Originally only Radiotext was available. After the update, users could access information about the programme, schedules, news, sport and weather.

Pages exclusive to digital are given a four digit number.\n\nThe [[Teletext Ltd.|Teletext]] service from the UK commercial broadcasters had stopped supporting the old boxes in 2005. As of 2010, the ONdigital boxes only load pages 100 and 199 and some interactive services that use channel 301, if any other page is loaded it exits the service.\n\nUsage of these boxes dwindled further as technology developed. They used \"original\" technology and as such were not upgradable. Following each regional changeover to full digital TV broadcasting, the remaining units are no longer of use, as they do not support the \"8K-mode\" for DVB-T introduced across the UK as part of the [[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Post-switchover|digital switchover]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n* [[MHEG-5]] Programming Language for Freeview\n* [[BBC Online]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{BBC}}\n{{BBC Television}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc Red Button}}\n[[Category:1999 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999]]\n[[Category:BBC New Media]]\n[[Category:BBC Television]]\n[[Category:Digital television]]\n[[Category:Interactive television]]", "sha1": "c96mxrkto6b6f9y7aw2s2r8pa5oitie"}}, {"title": "Backplane", "ns": "0", "id": "4352", "revision": {"id": "866616339", "parentid": "843473419", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T12:59:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta9)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2012}}\n[[Image:PICMG-Backplane-Details.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Major components on a PICMG 1.3 active backplane]]\n[[File:PDP-8I-backplane.jpg|thumb|Wire-wrapped backplane from a 1960s [[PDP-8]] minicomputer]]\nA '''backplane''' (or \"backplane system\") is a group of [[electrical connector]]s in parallel with each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors, forming a [[computer bus]]. It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete [[computer system]]. Backplanes commonly use a [[printed circuit board]], but [[Wire wrap|wire-wrapped]] backplanes have also been used in [[minicomputer]]s and high-reliability applications.\n\n==Usage==\nEarly microcomputer systems like the [[Altair 8800]] used a backplane for  the processor and [[expansion card]]s. A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements. A backplane uses plug-in cards for storage and processing.\n\nBackplanes are normally used in preference to cables because of their greater [[Reliability engineering|reliability]]. In a cabled system, the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added or removed from the system; this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures. A backplane does not suffer from this problem, so its service life is limited only by the longevity of its connectors. For example, the [[DIN 41612]] connectors used in the [[VMEbus]] system can withstand 50 to 500 insertions and removals (called ''mating cycles''), depending on their quality.  To transmit information, Serial Back-Plane technology uses a [[low-voltage differential signaling]] transmission method for sending information.<ref>{{cite web|last=Varnarvas|first=Kosta|title=Serial Back-Plane Technologies in Advanced Avionics Architectures|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20050215620|work=NASA Technical Reports Server|publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center|accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are bus expansion cables which will extend a computer bus to an external backplane, usually located in an enclosure, to provide more or different slots than the host computer provides.  These cable sets have a transmitter board located in the computer, an expansion board in the remote backplane, and a cable between the two.\n\n==Active versus passive backplanes==\n[[Image:ISA-Backplane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|ISA Passive Backplane showing connectors and parallel signal traces on back side. Only components are connectors, capacitors, resistors and voltage indicator LEDs.]]\nBackplanes have grown in complexity from the simple [[Industry Standard Architecture]] (ISA) (used in the original [[IBM PC]]) or [[S-100 bus|S-100]] style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus. Due to limitations inherent in the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) specification for driving slots, backplanes are now offered as '''passive''' and '''active'''.\n\nTrue passive backplanes offer no active bus driving circuitry. Any desired arbitration logic is placed on the daughter cards. Active backplanes include chips which [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]] the various signals to the slots.\n\nThe distinction between the two isn't always clear, but may become an important issue if a whole system is expected to not have a [[single point of failure]] (SPOF). A passive backplane, even if it ''is'' single, is not usually considered a SPOF. Active backplanes are more complicated and thus have a non-zero risk of malfunction.\n\n==Backplanes versus motherboards==\nWhen a backplane is used with a plug-in [[single board computer]] (SBC) or [[System Host Board|system host board]] (SHB), the combination provides the same functionality as a [[motherboard]], providing processing power, memory, I/O and slots for plug-in cards.  While there are a few motherboards that offer more than 8 slots, that is the traditional limit.  In addition, as technology progresses, the availability and number of a particular slot type may be limited in terms of what is currently offered by motherboard manufacturers.\n\nHowever, backplane architecture is somewhat unrelated to the SBC technology plugged into it.  There are some limitations to what can be constructed, in that the SBC chip set and processor have to provide the capability of supporting the slot types. In addition, virtually an unlimited number of slots can be provided with 20, including the SBC slot, as a practical though not an absolute limit.  Thus, a PICMG backplane can provide any number and any mix of ISA, PCI, PCI-X, and PCI-e slots, limited only by the ability of the SBC to interface to and drive those slots.  For example, an SBC with the latest i7 processor could interface with a backplane providing up to 19 ISA slots to drive legacy I/O cards.\n\n== Midplane ==\nSome backplanes are constructed with slots for connecting to devices on both sides, and are referred to as midplanes. This ability to plug cards into either side of a midplane is often useful in larger systems made up primarily of modules attached to the midplane.\n\nMidplanes are often used in computers, mostly in [[blade server]]s, where server blades reside on one side and the peripheral (power, networking, and other I/O) and service modules reside on the other.\nMidplanes are also popular in networking and telecommunications equipment where one side of the chassis accepts system processing cards and the other side of the chassis accepts network interface cards.\n\nOrthogonal midplanes connect vertical cards on one side to horizontal boards on the other side.<ref>\nKevin O\u2019Connor.\n[http://www.ecnmag.com/articles/2010/12/orthogonal-backplane-connector-technology-offers-design-flexibility \"Orthogonal Backplane Connector Technology Offers Design Flexibility\"].\n2010.\n</ref><ref>Pete.\n[http://www.connector.com/2011/02/high-speed-orthogonal-connectors-optimize-signal-integrity/ \"High-Speed Orthogonal Connectors Optimize Signal Integrity\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428122800/http://www.connector.com/2011/02/high-speed-orthogonal-connectors-optimize-signal-integrity/ |date=28 April 2015 }}.\n2011.</ref>\nOne common orthogonal midplane connects many vertical telephone [[line card]]s on one side, each one connected to copper telephone wires, to a horizontal communications card on the other side.<ref>\n[http://www.fci.com/en/products/backplane-connectors/airmax-vs-backplane/airmax-vs-orthogonal.html \"AirMax VS Orthogonal\"].\n</ref>\n\nA \"virtual midplane\" is an imaginary plane between vertical cards on one side that directly connect to horizontal boards on the other side; the card-slot aligners of the card cage and self-aligning connectors on the cards hold the cards in position.<ref>\nMichael Fowler.\n[http://electronicdesign.com/boards/virtual-midplane-realizes-ultrafast-card-interconnects \"Virtual Midplane Realizes Ultrafast Card Interconnects\"].\nElectronic Design.\n2002.\n</ref>\n\nSome people use the term \"midplane\" to describe a board that sits between and connects a hard drive hot-swap backplane and redundant power supplies.<ref>\n[http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&objectID=c00881823&jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001 \"HP StorageWorks Modular Smart Array 70 Enclosure - Replacing the Backplane\"].\n</ref><ref>\n[http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/s5520ur/sb/r2612ur_service_guide_14.pdf \"Intel Server System SR2612UR Service Guide\"].\n</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|STORAGE|Backplanes in storage}}Backplanes in storage==\n\nServers commonly have a backplane to attach hot swappable hard drives; backplane pins pass directly into hard drive sockets without cables. They may have single connector to connect one [[disk array controller]] or multiple connectors that can be connected to one or more controllers in arbitrary way. Backplanes are commonly found in [[disk enclosure]]s, [[disk array]]s, and [[Server (computing)|server]]s.\n\nBackplanes for SAS and SATA HDDs most commonly use the [[SGPIO]] protocol as means of communication between the [[host adapter]] and the backplane. Alternatively [[SCSI Enclosure Services]] can be used. With [[Parallel SCSI]] subsystems, [[SAF-TE]] is used.\n\n==Platforms==\n\n===PICMG===\n[[Image:SBC-Backplane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[single-board computer]] installed into a [[#Active versus passive backplanes|passive]] backplane]]\n\n{{main | PICMG }}\nA single-board computer meeting the PICMG 1.3 specification and compatible with a PICMG 1.3 backplane is referred to as a [[system host board]].\n\nIn the Intel Single Board Computer world, [[PICMG]] provides standards for the backplane interface:\n[[PICMG 1.0]], 1.1 and 1.2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm |title=PICMG 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 |publisher=Picmgeu.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626143521/http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm |archivedate=26 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> provide ISA and PCI support, with 1.2 adding PCIX support.\nPICMG 1.3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm |title=PICMG 1.3 |publisher=Picmgeu.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626143521/http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm |archivedate=26 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/SHB_Express.htm |title=PICMG 1.3 SHB Express Resources |publisher=Picmg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130222348/http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/SHB_Express.htm |archivedate=30 November 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> provides PCI-Express support.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Motherboard]]\n*[[Switched fabric]]\n*[[Daughterboard]]\n*[[M-Module]]\n* [[SS-50 Bus]]\n* [[STD Bus]]\n* [[STEbus]]\n* [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)]]\n* [[VXI]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Backplanes}}\n\n[[Category:Computer buses]]", "sha1": "rgm86fwom1z288gg4jl4ujlkj535hrc"}}, {"title": "Baldric", "ns": "0", "id": "4353", "revision": {"id": "843854277", "parentid": "842400719", "timestamp": "2018-05-31T22:20:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jim.henderson", "id": "2255048"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* See also */ with a K", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the article of clothing||Baldrick (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Image:BandRegalBaldric.png|thumb|U.S Army band baldric]]\n[[Image:AdamclisiMetope.jpg|thumb|A cavalryman wearing a mail shirt with a baldric over his right shoulder.]]\nA '''baldric''' (also '''baldrick''', '''bawdrick''', '''bauldrick''' as well as other rare or obsolete variations) is a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] worn over one shoulder that is typically used to carry a weapon (usually a [[sword]]) or other implement such as a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] or [[drum]].<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/86/B0038600.html baldric.

The early Islamic Arabs wore baldrics with their armor. The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and while allowing easy access to the object carried.  For example, the late 18th-century British Army's distinctive \"[[Red coat (British army)|Red coat]]\" uniform pattern featured a pair of white baldrics crossed at the chest, with a soldier's [[bayonet]] sheath suspended from one and his [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]] suspended from the other.  Alternatively, and especially in modern times, the baldric may fill a ceremonial role rather than a practical one.\n\n==Roman balteus==\nDuring [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]] the '''balteus'''  (plural ''baltei'') was a type of baldric commonly used to suspend a [[gladius|sword]]. It was a belt generally worn over the shoulder, passing obliquely down to the side, typically made of leather, often ornamented with precious stones, metals or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Balteus.html |title=Ba\u02b9lteus from a Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |page=196 |author=William Smith |location=London |year=1875 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |publisher=John Murray }}</ref> There was also a similar belt worn by the Romans, particularly by soldiers, called a ''cintus'' (pl. ''cinti'') that fastened around the waist. The word ''accintus'' meaning a soldier (literally, \"girt\" as for battle) attests to this differing usage.\n\n==Today==\nMany non-military or paramilitary organisations include baldrics as part of ceremonial dress.  The [[Knights of Columbus]] 4th Degree Colour Corps uses a baldric as part of their uniform;<ref>[http://www.kofcsupplies.com/ccp0-catshow/4thdegreecolorcorps.html 4th Degree Colour Corps<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.carr.org/~meripper/kofc/assembly/regalia.asp Knights of Columbus, Emblem, Jewels, and Regalia<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003195319/http://www.carr.org/~meripper/kofc/assembly/regalia.asp |date=3 October 2007 }}</ref> it supports a ceremonial sword.\n[[Image:IlliniDrumline postgame concert 060916.jpg|thumb|left|The Marching Illini Drumline with double baldrics]]\nThe University of Illinois Marching Illini wore two baldrics as a part of their uniform until 2009, with one over each shoulder. They crossed in the front and back and were buttoned onto the jacket beneath a cape and epaulets.  Today, the current Marching Illini wears one baldric with two sides:  ILLINI is on one side and the traditional orange and white baldric from the previous uniform.\n\nA crossed pair of baldrics is often worn as part of uniform of [[Morris dance]] sides; different colours of baldric help to distinguish different sides.\n\n==In literature and culture==\nThe baldric appears in the literary canon. Britomart, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s [[The Faerie Queene|Faerie Queene]], clothes herself in a borrowed armour \"with brave bauldrick garnished\" before embarking on her quest (Book III, canto iii).  Benedick, from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', says \"But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldric all women shall pardon me.\" A baldric features prominently in Chapter 4 of [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. The yeoman in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]] ''is described as wearing a \"baldrick of bright green.\" The baldric of [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] plays a key part in the [[Aeneid]], leading Aeneas to kill Turnus. In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Boromir]] is described: \"On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees.\" In [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] Gawain returns from his battle with the Green Knight wearing the green girdle \"obliquely, like a baldric, bound at his side,/ below his left shoulder, laced in a knot, in betokening the blame he had borne for his fault.\"\n\nSome [[Klingon]]s wear baldrics in ''[[Star Trek]]'', such as [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]], [[Koloth]], [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] or [[Worf]] although sometimes they are referred to as a [[sash]].  The character Worf does so in almost every one of his appearances through two series and four films.

A [[Army of the North (France)|French army]] under the command of [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: a [[British Army|British]]-led Allied army under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and a [[Prussia]]n army under the command of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, Prince of Wahlstatt]]. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition, and began to mobilize armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a co-ordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, while at the same time a portion of the French army attacked an Allied army at the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]]. Despite holding his ground at Quatre Bras, the defeat of the Prussians forced Wellington to withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, who had [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdrawn parallel to Wellington]] in good order. This resulted in the separate and simultaneous [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard.\n\nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] [[escarpment]], across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves, the [[French Imperial Guard]], to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and on 7 July coalition forces entered Paris. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]], and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]], and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by a large monument, the [[Lion's Mound]]. As this mound was constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, the contemporary topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]]. Napoleon was forced to leave 20,000 men in Western France to reduce a royalist insurrection.]]\n\nOn 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared him an outlaw]].{{sfn|''Brown University Library''}} Four days later, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=59}} Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the [[Seventh Coalition]] from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nHad Napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might have been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.\n\nAn additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon crop.jpg|thumb|upright|The resurgent [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies and [[Defeat in detail|annihilate each one separately]].]]\n[[File:Lord Arthur Wellesley the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|1st Duke of Wellington]], commander of the Anglo-allied army]]\n[[File:Bl\u00fccher (nach Gebauer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], who had led one of the coalition armies defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]], commanded the Prussian army]]\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French [[Waterloo Campaign: Start of hostilities (15 June)|rapidly overran Coalition outposts]], securing Napoleon's \"central position\" between Wellington's and Bl\u00fccher's armies. He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's.\n\nOnly very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.{{sfn|Chesney|1874|p=144}}\n\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow's]] IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable. The next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the previous year\u2014the low [[ridge]] of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and the [[Sonian Forest]].{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=527}}\n\nNapoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry [[action at Genappe]], there was no substantial engagement.\n\nBefore leaving Ligny, Napoleon had ordered Grouchy, who commanded the right wing, to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|follow up the retreating Prussians]] with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy.\n\nAs the 17th of June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Bl\u00fccher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around {{convert|8|mi|km}} to the east of the city. Early on the morning of the 18th, Wellington received an assurance from Bl\u00fccher that the Prussian army would support him. He decided to hold his ground and give battle.\n\n==Armies==\n{{Main|Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign}}\nThree armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's ''Arm\u00e9e du Nord'', a multinational army under Wellington, and a Prussian army under Bl\u00fccher.\n\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|direction = vertical\n|image1 = Marechal Ney.jpg\n|width1 = 180\n|alt1 =\n|image2 = YoungwilliamII.jpg\n|width2 = 180\n|alt2 =\n|footer = ''Top,'' Marshal [[Michel Ney]], who exercised tactical control of the greater part of the French forces for most of the battle. ''Bottom''  [[William II of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]], commander of the Anglo-allied [[Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign#I Corps 2|I Corps]].\n}}\n\nThe French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=75}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Hofschr\u00f6er|1999|p=68}} gives 73,000.</ref> Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor.{{sfn|Glover|2014|page=30}} The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured [[heavy cavalry]], and seven of highly versatile [[lancers]] who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.\n\nHowever as the army took shape, French officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.\n\nThe French army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.\n\nWellington later said that he had \"an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=485}} His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were [[Peninsular War]] veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children. None of the privates, perhaps were over eighteen years of age\" {{Harv|Mercer|1891|p=218}}.}}{{efn|On 13 June, the commandant at [[Ath]] requested powder and cartridges as members of a Hanoverian reserve regiment there had never yet fired a shot {{Harv|Longford|1971|p=486}}.}} The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and ''foreign'' troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange's]] younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance&nbsp;\u2013 guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten|Zieten's]] I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I|Pirch I's]] II Corps engaged at about 18:00.\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|km}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map showing the local geography, with Waterloo defending the approach to [[Brussels]]]]\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the [[King's German Legion]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|thumb|upright=4|center|A panorama of the Waterloo battlefield in 2012]]\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the [[Battle of Ligny]]. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and [[Scots Guards|the Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers.

This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other ([[Baron Charles-Francois Bourgeois|Bourgeois']]) was to attack the eastern side of the same post.{{sfn|Haweis|1908|p=228}}\n\nThe divisions were to advance in [[echelon (formation)|echelon]] from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart \u2014 the 2nd Division ([[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot's]]) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division ([[Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet|Marcognet's]]) next, and the 4th Division ([[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Durutte|Durutte's]]) on the right.They were led by Ney to the assault, each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred [[File (formation)|files]].{{sfn|Haweis|1908|p=228}}\n\nThe leftmost division, advanced on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt's]] brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot's]] division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack's]] 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], the 92nd Gordons and the [[44th Foot]] totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle \u2013 a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft|m}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]]).]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211,212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252,361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob.

A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by [[Indigenous Australians]] for hunting.\n\nBoomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an [[Australia]]n icon,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}</ref> and come in various shapes and sizes.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|A boomerang returns to the point from where it was sent]]\nA boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones.  Modern boomerangs used for [[sport]] are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or even high-tech materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird and many other less common types.\n\nAn important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.\n\nThe most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern use|various shapes or sizes]].\n\nHistorical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and inhabitants of southern [[India]] for killing birds and rabbits.<ref name=\"Brittanica\">{{cite encyclopedia |title = Boomerang |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73646/boomerang |accessdate= 25 January 2009 }}</ref> Indeed, some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in [[hand to hand combat]] by [[Indigenous Australians]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Tom |url= http://www.howstuffworks.com/boomerang.htm/printable |title= Battle Boomerangs |publisher= Howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> [[Ancient Egypt]]ian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs.<ref>Rivers, Pitt. \"On the Egyptian Boomerang and its Affinities\".

There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], plastic or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.\n\nBoomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to [[clay pigeons]] in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.<ref>{{cite av media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwv2BhJEjDo |title= Aussie Boomerang Shootin' |date= 15 October 2012 |work= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe modern boomerang is often [[computer-aided design]]ed with precision airfoils.

It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Lloyd |first1= John |last2= Mitchinson |first2= John |title= The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher= Mackays of Chatham |isbn= 978-0-571-23368-7 |page= 244 }}</ref> In southeastern [[Australia]], it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite these notions and similar claims by a few European writers, there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon.{{cn|date=October 2018}}}\n\nTraditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called \"throwsticks\" or \"kylies\", were used for hunting a variety of prey, from [[kangaroo]]s to parrots; at a range of about {{convert|100|m}}, a 2-kg (4.4 lb) non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal.<ref name=\":0\" /> A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as \"beaked kylies\", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Boomerangs - melbourne show 2005.jpg |thumb|left|Boomerangs for sale at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]\n\nA returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Although it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.\n\nReturning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]].\n\nAs the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both \"wings\". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.<ref name=hyper>{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}</ref>\n\nWhile it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.<ref name=hyper/>\n\nThus [[gyroscopic precession]] is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.\n\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= 'baggressive.com' |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}</ref> Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.\n\nSome boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s\u2014bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).\n\n=== Modern construction ===\n<!-- Much of this section is written as if it is a how-to article, and may also be a possible cut-and-paste move that was slightly edited. This section should be edited to conform to a proper encyclopedic style. -->\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms.  If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface.  (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45\u00b0 angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1\u20132&nbsp;mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully.  Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2\u20133&nbsp;mm) on both wings at this point.  If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) \u2013 if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right.  Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang.  Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more.  After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.\n\n=== Tuning the flight ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nThe boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the [[aerodynamic]] forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a [[microwave oven]] which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. [[Angle of attack]] of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall [[dihedral angle]] of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.\n\nThe hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target.\n\n=== Art renaissance ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nBeginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.\n\n== Throwing technique ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}\nA right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.\n[[File:Boomerang School.JPG|thumb|right|A boomerang school, William Street, Kings Cross, Sydney]]\n\nMost sport boomerangs are in the range of about {{convert|70|to|110|g|oz}}. The range on most is between {{cvt|20|and|40|m|yd|0}}. Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.\n\nThe correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the \"eye of the wind\" and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower. It is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind \u2013 the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown. A light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it is usually too strong for boomerangs.\n\nA properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.\n\n== Competitions and records ==\n\nIn international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower [[Manuel Sch\u00fctz]]. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 [[Fridolin Frost]] from Germany won the title.\n\nThe team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian [[Alejandro Palacio]]. In 2016 USA became team world champion.\n\n=== Competition disciplines ===\n\nModern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below<ref name=\"German Wikipedia\">Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.\n\nEvents include:\n\n* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.\n* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.\n* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.\n* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.\n* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.\n* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.\n* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.\n* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.\n* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.\n\n=== World records ===\n{{updated|September 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Discipline\n! Result\n! Name\n! Year\n!

In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] [[extrusion|extrude]] of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he/she does not have to travel {{convert|50|m|yd}} after the throw, to recover the boomerang.\n\n=== General properties ===\nLong-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.\n\nToday's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? \u2013 question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.\n\n=== Flight path ===\nThe projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.\n\nFrom theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).\n\n== Related terms ==\nIn [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.<ref>{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\"Kylie\" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=www.bumerang-sport.de|access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref> Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning \"boomerang\" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word \"karli\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Batarang]]\n* [[Bat'leth]]\n* [[Captain Boomerang]]\n* [[Chakram]]\n* [[Commonwealth Boomerang]], a [[World War II]] fighter-plane\n* [[Frisbee]]\n* [[Shuriken]]\n* [[Throwing stick]]\n* [[Valari]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.answers.com/topic/boomerang Boomerang Ask.com] Design, Throwing, Flight Path.\n* [[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://www.kbn3.com/bip/index2.html Instructions of Paper Boomerangs in 70 Languages], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HZOLjFK0M Flight of paper boomerang]\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/boomerang.aspx Boomerang]\n* Valde-Nowak ''et al''.

He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' depicts this beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.\n\nSandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"[[cabinet card]]s\" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men were judged by how closely they matched these proportions.\n\n===First large-scale bodybuilding competition===\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\". It was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]. Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|title=Bodybuilders Through the Ages|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Bodybuilders-Through-the-Ages.html|date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham]]. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy, now the most famous of all, was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe. In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to [[Steve Reeves]] for winning the inaugural [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]]. It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, [[Frank Zane]], was presented with the bronze trophy, or at least a replica of it. Since then, [[Mr. Olympia]] winners have been awarded a replica of the bronze trophy.\n\nOn January 16, 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. The competition was promoted by [[Bernarr Macfadden]], the father of physical culture and publisher of the original bodybuilding magazines such as ''Health & Strength''. The winner was Al Treloar, who was declared \"The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Treloar/treloar.htm|title=Al Treloar at SandowPlus.com|publisher=Sandowplus.co.uk|date=December 28, 1903|accessdate=October 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629104307/http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Treloar/treloar.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Treloar won a [[US dollar|$]]1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, [[Thomas Edison]] made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and [[Charles Atlas]] continued to promote bodybuilding across the world. [[Alois P. Swoboda]] was an early pioneer in America.\n\n=== Notable early bodybuilders ===\n[[File:Ed_Fury_and_Jackie_Coey,_1953.jpg|left|thumb|266x266px|Model Jackie Coey with Mr. Los Angeles contestant [[Ed Fury]] in 1953]]\n\nMany other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include [[Earle Liederman]] (writer of some of bodybuilding's earliest books), [[Zishe Breitbart]], [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], Emy Nkemena, George F.

Mead (who became an impressive muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in [[World War I]]). Actor [[Francis X. Bushman]], who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous silent movie career.\n\n== 1950s{{ndash}}1960s ==\nBodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for bulking up and cutting down, the use of protein and other food supplements, and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, most notably the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB), founded by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the male-dominated contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. (insert town, city, state, or region)\" championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia (which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world).\n\nDuring the 1950s, the most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as movies. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The 1960s grew more in TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==1970s{{ndash}}1990s==\n=== New organizations ===\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 docudrama ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\n\n=== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ===\n[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|240x240px|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]\n\nThis period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing to the present day with [[Lee Haney]], [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus R\u00fchl]]. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] and [[Paul Demayo]] attained mass and size that were not seen previously but were not particularly successful at the pro level. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo combat steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Theunissen|first=Steve|title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed|website=|publisher=|url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|doi=|accessdate=February 27, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA). In [[Canada]], steroids are listed under Schedule IV of the ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act'', enacted by the [[Parliament of Canada|federal Parliament]] in 1996.<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/ ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act'', SC 1996, c. 19, Schedule IV, no. 23.]</ref>\n\n=== World Bodybuilding Federation ===\n{{Main|World Bodybuilding Federation}}\n\nIn 1990, [[professional wrestling]] promoter [[Vince McMahon]] announced that he was forming a new bodybuilding organization named the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]] (WBF). McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.\n\n==2000s==\nIn 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest. Other professional contests emerged in this period, such as the [[Arnold Classic]], [[Night of Champions (bodybuilding)|Night of Champions]], and the European Grand Prix of Bodybuilding.\n\nIn the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders emerged from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.\n\n=== Olympic sport discussion ===\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Littman|first=Jean|title=Bodybuilding And The Olympics: An Ongoing Controversy|website=|publisher=article99.com|url=http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205174022/http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 5, 2007|doi=|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Areas ==\n=== Professional bodybuilding ===\n{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.<ref>[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq \u2013 Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref> Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\n\n===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===\n{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.\n\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations. Some of the larger ones include MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.\n\nOther notable natural bodybuilding organizations include the [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) and the North American Natural Bodybuilding Federation (NANBF). NPC competitions screen competitors using ineffective lie detector tests to ensure fair practices. Such tests are very error-prone, and some competitors are not even tested.\n\nThis is how the NPC differs from the NANBF. The NANBF takes a more direct approach by taking urine samples from all competitors that are tested for steroids and any other substances on the banned list. The NANBF also differs from the NPC when it comes to judging. The criteria for certain poses differs from organization to organization. The NANBF even has an elevated calf pose which is unique for their competitions.\n\n=== Female bodybuilding ===\n{{main|Female bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]\nThe first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest\u2014that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.<ref>Todd, Jan, \"Bodybuilding\", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999</ref> In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a gymnastic element to them. A study by the ''[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]'' found that female bodybuilders who are taking [[anabolic steroids]] are more likely to have qualified for [[Substance dependence|substance dependence disorder]] and have been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and have a history of sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Mitchell|title=Women and Anabolic Steroids: An Analysis of a Dozen Users|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|date=Nov 2010|volume=20|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|pmid=21079445|doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181fb5370}}</ref>\n\nE Wilma Conner competed in the 2011 NPC Armbrust Pro Gym Warrior Classic Championships in [[Loveland, Colorado]], at the age of 75 years and 349 days.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|page=60}}</ref>\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:Luk\u00e1\u0161_Osladil.jpg|right|thumb|Lukas Osladil posing onstage with a variation of the [[Most Muscular]] pose]]\nIn competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain an [[Aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing body and balanced physique.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 10 Most Impressive Bodybuilder Physiques of All Time\n | publisher =Muscleprodigy \n | url = http://www.muscleprodigy.com/top-10-most-impressive-bodybuilder-physiques-of-all-time-arcl-1797.html\n | accessdate = June 14, 2013\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://muscletime.com/news/judging-the-2008-mr-olympia-judges-provide-full-transparency-and-complete-explanation-of-results|title=Judging the 2008 Mr. Olympia: Judges Provide Full Transparency and Complete Explanation of Results|publisher=Muscletime|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses: the front lat spread, rear lat spread, [[wiktionary:front double biceps|front double biceps]], [[wiktionary:back double biceps|back double biceps]], [[wiktionary:side chest|side chest]], [[wiktionary:side triceps|side triceps]], [[Most Muscular]] (men only), abdominals and thighs. Each competitor also performs a routine to display their physique. A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders spend a lot of time practising their posing in mirrors.\n\nIn contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is important, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.\n\n=== Preparations ===\n==== Cutting and bulking ====\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12\u201314 weeks from competition, attempt to lose [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as \"cutting\"). The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of growth.\n\nThe cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Charles|author2=Frank L|author3=Evens W|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding.|journal=Sports Med|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=317\u201327|pmid=15107010|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}</ref>\n\nThe bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.<ref>the science and development of muscle hypertrophy, Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, page 139-140</ref>  A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions.  Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much fat-free mass as possible.\n\n==== Clean bulking ====\nMany non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt the conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats,  \"Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish,\" says White. \"Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example\".<ref>Giblin, Chris. \"Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy.\" Joe Weider's Muscle & Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.</ref> To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. Macronutrient goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.\n\n====Dirty bulking====\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a caloric surplus, without finding the exact number of macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method.<ref>Evans, Rian. (April 6, 2015) [http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/dirty-bulking-why-you-need-to-know-the-dirty-truth.htm Dirty Bulking: Why You Need To Know The Dirty Truth!]. Bodybuilding.com. Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-competition ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders may decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"[[vascularity]]\". The appearance of veins is further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step is the use of weights to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size.\n\n== Muscle growth ==\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy:\n* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.\n* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.\n* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.\n\nBodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\".\n\n=== Weight training ===\n{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}\n\n[[Weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is to repair this micro-trauma that result in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.<ref name=\"pmid7371625\">{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25\u201334|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}</ref>\n\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In either case, there is an increase in size and strength of the muscles (compared to if that same individual does not lift weights at all). However, the emphasis is different.\n\nMany trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals. i.e. a bodybuilder will use sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to myofibrillar hypertrophy temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\".\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. A sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]] in preparation for a contest. The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Manoreem|first=MM|author2=Thompson J|author3=Russo M|title=Diet and exercise strategies of a world-class bodybuilder|journal=Int J Sport Nutr.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=76\u201386|date=March 1993|doi=|pmid=8499940|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Carbohydrates ====\n[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Rob|title=Coach & Athletic Director|date=March 2002|volume=71|issue=8|page=3}}<!--|accessdate=November 5, 2012--></ref> Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriadis|first=George|last2=Mitrou|first2=Panayota|last3=Lambadiari|first3=Vaia|last4=Maratou|first4=Eirini|last5=Raptis|first5=Sotirios A.|date=August 2011|title=Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue|journal=Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice|volume=93 Suppl 1|pages=S52\u201359|doi=10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6|issn=1872-8227|pmid=21864752}}</ref> It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein\u2014which also induces the release of insulin\u2014it is impossible to add muscle mass.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0368-2|pmid=17957382|title=Effects of contraction and insulin on protein synthesis, AMP-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation state of translation factors in rat skeletal muscle|journal=Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv|volume=455|issue=6|pages=1129\u201340|year=2007|last1=Miranda|first1=Lisa|last2=Horman|first2=Sandrine|last3=De Potter|first3=Isabelle|last4=Hue|first4=Louis|last5=Jensen|first5=J\u00f8rgen|last6=Rider|first6=Mark H.}}</ref> Bodybuilders seek out [[Glycemic index|low-glycemic]] [[polysaccharide]]s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-[[Glycemic index|glycemic]] sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=King|first=Michael W.|title=Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|website=|publisher=IU School of Medicine|url=http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/gluconeogenesis.html|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Protein ====\n[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]\nThe motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s.

Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value|Biological Value (BV)]] and quick absorption rates. However, [[Whey protein|whey]] has a bigger effect than Casein on insulin levels. [[Whey protein|Whey]] triggers about double the amount of insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

Bodybuilders are usually thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of [[soy]], which is additionally avoided due to its claimed [[estrogenic]] properties. Still, some nutrition experts believe that soy, [[flax seeds]] and many other plants that contain the weak estrogen-like compounds or [[Phytoestrogens|phytoestrogen]]s can be used beneficially, as phytoestrogens compete with estrogens for receptor sites in the male body and can block its actions. This can also include some inhibition of [[pituitary]] functions while stimulating the P450 system (the system that eliminates hormones, drugs and metabolic waste product from the body) in the liver to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen.<ref name=\"MikeFalcon\">Falcon, Mike.

A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g. [[seitan]]) and two parts soy protein (e.g. [[tofu]]) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders.

This method can serve two purposes: to limit overindulging in the cutting phase, and to physically allow for the consumption of large volumes of food during the bulking phase. Contrary to popular belief, eating more frequently does not increase [[Metabolic rate|basal metabolic rate]] when compared to the traditional 3 meals a day. While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the [[thermic effect of food]], it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day. Well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and [[doubly labeled water]] have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.<ref name=\"BellisleF\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellisle F, McDevitt R, Prentice AM|title=Meal frequency and energy balance|journal=Br.

There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.<ref name=\"LonnieLowery_Overtraining\">Lowery, Lonnie.

Timely provision of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and various micronutrients such as [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical. A mental disorder known as bigorexia may be held accountable of some people overtraining. Sufferers feel as if they are never big enough or muscular enough. Therefore, this forces them to overtrain in order to try and reach this goal physique.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191\u2013198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|pmid=18759381|issn=1099-0968}}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that overtraining can be beneficial. One article published by ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' magazine stated that you can \"Overtrain for Big Gains\". It suggested that if one is planning a restful holiday and they do not wish to inhibit their bodybuilding lifestyle too much, they should overtrain before taking the holiday, so the body can rest easily and recuperate and grow. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as \"shock micro-cycles\" and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.<ref name=\"pmid14719980\">{{cite journal\n|pmid=14719980 |year=2003 |title=A framework for understanding the training process leading to elite performance |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=33 |issue=15 |pages=1103\u201326 |author=Smith DJ|doi=10.2165/00007256-200333150-00003}}</ref>\n\n== Injecting oil into muscles {{anchor|synthol}} ==\n'''Site enhancement oil''', often called \"'''santol'''\" or \"'''synthol'''\" (no relation to the [[Synthol (mouthwash)|Synthol]] mouthwash brand), refers to oils injected into muscles to increase the size or change the shape.

Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430190200/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html|date=30 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714004040&db=all|title=Informaworld link|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents ([[smallpox]], [[pneumonic plague]]) have the capability of person-to-person [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via [[Bioaerosol|aerosolized]] [[Droplet contact|respiratory droplets]]. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces.

A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape, before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving the terrorists a lead.\n\nA technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat ([[CRISPR]]) is now so cheap and widely available that scientists fear that the amateurs will start experimenting with them. In this technique, a DNA sequence is cut off and replaced with a new sequence or code that codes for a particular protein or characteristic, which could potentially show up in the required organism. Though this technique is a breakthrough and is commendable, it can cause serious issues and potential danger if used by people with wrong intentions.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=30 March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archivedate= 7 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force.\n\n====Anti-personnel====\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s, and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can often be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archivedate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n====Anti-agriculture====\nAnti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries; {{see also|United States military anti-plant research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants).

Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=sunshine>\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002. Retrieved 25 December 2008.</ref> The insects then act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method uses uninfected insects, such as bees, wasps, etc., to directly attack the enemy.<ref>Lockwood, Jeffrey A.

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).

Before that date, it had been included in the [[Book of Ezra]]; but in Latin Christian bibles from the 13th century onwards, the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah become separated; a separation that became canonised with the first printed bibles in Hebrew and Latin. Told largely in the form of a first-person [[memoir]], it concerns the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by [[Nehemiah]], a Jew who is a high official at the Persian court, and the dedication of the city and its people to God's laws ([[Torah]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe events take place in the second half of the 5th century BCE. Listed together with the Book of Ezra as [[Ezra-Nehemiah]], it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last= Albright|first= William|authorlink= William F.

Gruen (editors), ''Hellenistic Constructs: Essays In Culture, History, and Historiography'', p. 92 (University of California Press, 1997). {{ISBN|0-520-20676-2}}</ref>\n\nThe book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in [[Susa]], is informed that [[Jerusalem]] is without walls, and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Judah]] and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the [[law of Moses]]. After 12 years in [[Jerusalem]], he returns to [[Susa]] but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been [[backsliding]] and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem  to enforce the Law.\n# In the 20th year of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]], Nehemiah, cup-bearer to the King in [[Susa]] (the Persian capital), learns that the wall of Jerusalem is destroyed. He prays to God, recalling the sins of Israel and God's promise of restoration to the Land, and asks Artaxerxes for leave to return to Jerusalem and rebuild its walls; the king is receptive and extends his aid to this mission.\n# Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem, carrying letters of authorisation from the king; he inspects the walls.\n# Nehemiah and the Jews (including the 'High Priest' Eliashib), begin rebuilding Jerusalem.\n# The enemies of the Jews \u2013 Sanballat of Samaria, Tobiah the Ammonite, Geshem the Arab, and the men of Ashdod \u2013 plot to attack Jerusalem which necessitates the Jews working with weapons in their hands.\n# Nehemiah sees that the Jewish nobles are oppressing the poor, and forces the cancellation of all debt and mortgages; while previous governors have been corrupt and oppressive, he has been righteous and just.\n# Sanballat accuses Nehemiah of planning rebellion against Artaxerxes, and he is opposed even by Jewish nobles and prophets, but the wall is completed.\n# Nehemiah appoints officials and sets guards on the wall and gates; he plans to register the Jews, and finds the Census of those who had returned earlier.\n# Nehemiah assembles the people and has Ezra read to them the law-book of Moses; Nehemiah, Ezra and the Levites institute the [[Sukkot|Feast of Booths]], in accordance with the Law.\n# The Jews assemble in penance and prayer, recalling their past sins, God's help to them, and his promise of the land.\n# The priests, Levites and the Israelite people enter into a covenant, agreeing to separate themselves from the surrounding peoples and to keep the Law.\n# Jerusalem is repopulated by the Jews living in the towns and villages of Judah and Benjamin.\n# A list of priests and Levites who returned in the days of Cyrus (the first returnees from Babylon) is presented; Nehemiah, aided by Ezra, oversees the dedication of the walls and the rebuilt city.\n# After 12 years Nehemiah returns to Susa; he later comes back to Jerusalem, and finds that there has been backsliding in his absence. He takes measures to enforce his earlier reforms and asks for God's favour.\n\n== Historical background ==\nThe book is set in the 5th century BCE. Judah is one of several provinces within a larger satrapy (a large administrative unit) within the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The capital of the empire is at [[Susa]]. Nehemiah is a [[cup-bearer]] to king [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] \u2013 an important official position.\n\nAt his own request Nehemiah is sent to Jerusalem as governor of Yehud, the official Persian name for Judah. Jerusalem had been conquered and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586&nbsp;BCE and Nehemiah finds it still in ruins. His task is to rebuild the walls and to re-populate the city. He faces opposition from three powerful neighbours, the [[Samaritans]], the [[Ammon|Ammonites]], and the [[Arabs]], as well as the city of [[Ashdod]], but manages to rebuild the walls. He then purifies the Jewish community by enforcing its [[Racial segregation|segregation]] from its neighbours and enforces the laws of Moses.\n\n== Textual history ==\n{{Books of Ketuvim}}\n{{further|Ezra\u2013Nehemiah}}\n\nThe single book [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]], with title \"Ezra\", was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BC.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&source=bl&ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&hl=en&ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., \"The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues\" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p. 202</ref> It was first proposed to be considered as two books by the early Christian scholar [[Origen]] in the 3rd century AD; and [[Jerome]], writing in the early 5th century, noted that this division had since been adopted by Greek and Latin commentators; although in all surviving Christian Greek and [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] manuscripts Ezra-Nehemiah is one book denoted as '[[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah|Esdras B]]'.  Jerome himself rejected the division in his [[Vulgate]] translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew; and consequently no early Vulgate manuscripts separate the two books, <ref>{{Cite journal|volume=110|pages=5-26|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les livres d\u2019Esdras et leur num\u00e9rotation dans l\u2019histoire du canon de la Bible latin|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2000}}</ref> and they remained undivided as a single book in the 8th century commentary of [[Bede]], and in the 9th century bibles of [[Alcuin]] and [[Theodulf of Orleans]].  However, from the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that reintroduce Origen's division; and this becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century. It was not until 1516/17, in the first printed [[Mikraot Gedolot|Rabbinic Bible]] of [[Daniel Bomberg]] that the separation was generally introduced into Hebrew Bibles.\n\n== Composition and date ==\nThe combined book Ezra\u2013Nehemiah of the earliest Christian and Jewish period was known as Ezra and was probably attributed to [[Ezra]] himself; according to a rabbinic tradition, however, Nehemiah was the real author but was forbidden to claim authorship because of his bad habit of disparaging others.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+in+the+origins&source=bl&ots=LBwE7k7-kA&sig=op-caFN9i6l1JShKPoRBIIybVsY&hl=en&ei=4kOQTOGVDY2lcaGZ-dwM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Blenkinsopp, Joseph, \"Judaism, the first phase\" (Eerdmans, 2009)] p. 86</ref>\n\nThe Nehemiah Memorial, chapters 1\u20137 and 11\u201313, may have circulated as an independent work before being combined with the Ezra material to form Ezra\u2013Nehemiah.<ref name=\"books.google\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&dq=Old+Testament+survey:+the+message,+form,+and+background+of+the+Old+Testament&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=zPyRTIKzDcuXcZz0uOUG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false La Sor, W.S., William Sanford La Sor, Hubbard, D.A., Bush, F.W., \"Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament\" (Eerdmans, 1996)]  p. 551</ref> Determining the composition of the Memorial depends on the dates of Nehemiah's mission: It is commonly accepted that \"Artaxerxes\" was Artaxerxes I (there were two later kings of the same name), and that Nehemiah's first period in Jerusalem was therefore 445\u2013433&nbsp;BC;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&source=bl&ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&hl=en&ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., \"The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues\" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p. 205</ref> allowing for his return to Susa and second journey to Jerusalem, the end of the 5th century BC is therefore the earliest possible date for the Memorial.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues&source=bl&ots=fUEuF-W9Ul&sig=YcThOSXuCkrdCzelf6hXPh0_2Mo&hl=en&ei=AOyRTKGFJ4KecIS89MYG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Graham, M.P, and McKenzie, Steven L., \"The Hebrew Bible today: an introduction to critical issues\" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998)] p. 213</ref> The Nehemiah Memorial is interrupted by chapters 8\u201310, which concern Ezra.

It has come down in two distinct though related versions, one in Hebrew, the other known from a Greek translation.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=82}} Scholars have had differing opinions as to how to reconstruct the historical aspects of the Book of Jeremiah due to the differences each version contains when compared with each other.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|pp=85\u201386}} The book is a representation of the message and significance of the prophet substantially intended for the Jews in Babylonian exile: its purpose is to explain the disaster as God's response to Israel's pagan worship:{{sfn|Allen|1998|pp=7, 14}} the people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness make judgement inevitable, although restoration and a new covenant are foreshadowed.{{sfn|Biddle|2009|p=1074}}\n\n== Structure ==\n:''(Taken from [[Michael D. Coogan]]'s ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament''; other sources will give slightly different divisions)''\n\nIt is difficult to discern any structure in Jeremiah, probably because the book had such a long and complex composition history.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2008|p=241}} It can be divided into roughly 6 sections:{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=299}}\n*Chapters 1\u201325 (The earliest and main core of Jeremiah's message)\n*Chapters 26\u201329 (Biographic material and interaction with other prophets)\n*Chapters 30\u201333 (God's promise of restoration including Jeremiah's \"new covenant\" which is [[New Covenant#Judaism|interpreted differently in Judaism]] than it is in [[New Covenant#Christianity|Christianity]])\n*Chapters 34\u201345 (Mostly interaction with [[Zedekiah]] and the fall of Jerusalem)\n*Chapters 46\u201351 (Divine punishment to the nations surrounding Israel)\n*Chapter 52 (Appendix that retells [[2 Kings]] 24.18\u201325.30)\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt van Rijn]], \"Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem\", c. 1630]]\n\n=== Historical background ===\nThe background to Jeremiah is briefly described in the superscription to the book: Jeremiah began his prophetic mission in the thirteenth year of king [[Josiah]] (about 627 BC) and finished in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah (586), \"when Jerusalem went into exile in the sixth month.\" During this period, Josiah changed the Judahite religion, Babylon destroyed Assyria, Egypt briefly imposed vassal status on Judah, Babylon defeated Egypt and made Judah a Babylonian vassal (605), Judah revolted but was subjugated again by Babylon (597), and Judah revolted once more. This revolt was the final one: Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple and exiled its king and many of the leading citizens in 586, ending Judah's existence as an independent or quasi-independent kingdom and inaugurating the [[Babylonian exile]].{{sfn|Brettler|2010|p=173}}\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe book can be conveniently divided into biographical, prose and poetic strands, each of which can be summarised separately. \nThe biographical material is to be found in chapters 26\u201329, 32, and 34\u201344, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in chapter 7 and the covenant passage in 11:1\u201317, are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the [[Deuteronomist]]s, the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from [[Book of Judges|Judges]] to [[Books of Kings|Kings]], and while it is unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, they may well have their roots in traditions about what he said and did.\nThe poetic material is found largely in chapters 1\u201325 and consists of oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger. These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book. Allied to them, and also probably a reflection of the authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiah's confessions or spiritual diary. In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness at those who oppose or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him.{{sfn|Davidson|1993|pp=345\u201346}}\n\n== Composition ==\n=== Texts and manuscripts ===\nJeremiah exists in two versions, a Greek translation, called the Septuagint, dating from the last few centuries before Christ and found in the earliest Christian manuscripts, and the [[Masoretic]] Hebrew text of traditional Jewish bibles \u2013 the Greek version is shorter than the Hebrew by about one eighth, and arranges the material differently. Equivalents of both versions were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], so that is clear that the differences mark important stages in the transmission of the text.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=130}} Most scholars hold that the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint version is older than the Masoretic text, and that the Masoretic evolved either from this or from a closely related version.{{sfn|Williamson|2009|p=168}}<ref>The Oxford Handbook of the Prophets, Oxford University Press, 2016, edited Carolyn Sharp, author Marvin A Sweeney, p. 456</ref> The shorter version ultimately became canonical in Greek Orthodox churches, while the longer was adopted in Judaism and in Western Christian churches.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n=== Composition history===\nIt is generally agreed that the three types of material interspersed through the book \u2013 poetic, narrative, and biographical \u2013 come from different sources or circles.{{sfn|Davidson|1993|p=345}} Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably to be found in the poetic sections of chapters 1\u201325, but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers (including perhaps the prophet's companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists.{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=300}} The date of the final versions of the book (Greek and Hebrew) can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the [[Masoretic]] (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|p=94}}\n\n=== Literary development ===\nThe Book of Jeremiah grew over a long period of time. The Greek stage, looking forward to the fall of Babylon and aligning in places with Second [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], had already seen major redaction (editing) in terms of overall structure, the superscriptions (sentences identifying following passages as the words of God or of Jeremiah), the assignment of historical settings, and arrangement of material, and may have been completed by the late Exilic period (last half of the 6th century BCE); the initial stages of the Masoretic Hebrew version may have been written not long afterwards, although  chapter {{bibleref2-nb|Jeremiah|33:14\u201326}} points to a setting in post-exilic times.{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=11}}\n\n=== Jeremiah ===\nAccording to its opening verses the book records the prophetic utterances of the priest [[Jeremiah]] son of Hilkiah, \"to whom the word of [[YHWH]] came in the days of king Josiah\" and after. Jeremiah lived during a turbulent period, the final years of the kingdom of Judah, from the death of king [[Josiah]] (609 BCE) and the loss of independence that followed, through the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the exile of much its population (587/586).{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|p=86}} The book depicts a remarkably introspective prophet, impetuous and often angered by the role into which he has been thrust, alternating efforts to warn the people with pleas to God for mercy, until he is ordered to \"pray no more for this people.\" He engages in extensive [[performance art]], walking about in the streets with a yoke about his neck and engaging in other efforts to attract attention. He is taunted and retaliates, is thrown in jail as the result, and at one point is thrown into a pit to die.\n\n=== Jeremiah and the Deuteronomists ===\nThe [[Deuteronomist]]s were a school or movement  who edited the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings into a more or less unified history of Israel (the so-called Deuteronomistic History) during the Jewish exile in Babylon (6th century BCE).{{sfn|Knight|1995|pp=65\u201366}} It is argued that the Deuteronomists played an important role in the production of the book of Jeremiah; for example, there is clear Deuteronomistic language in chapter 25, in which the prophet looks back over twenty-three years of unheeded prophecy. From the Deuteronomistic perspective the prophetic role implied, more than anything else, concern with law and covenant after the manner of Moses. On this reading Jeremiah was the last of a long line of prophets sent to warn Israel of the consequences of infidelity to God; unlike the Deuteronomists, for whom the call for repentance was always central, Jeremiah seems at some point in his career to have decided that further intercession was pointless, and that Israel's fate was sealed.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|pp=132, 135\u201336}}\n\n=== Jeremiah as a new Moses ===\n\nThe book's superscription claims that Jeremiah was active for forty years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah (627 BCE) to the fall of Jerusalem in 587. It is clear from the last chapters of the book, however, that he continued to speak in Egypt after the assassination of Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah, in 582. This suggests that the superscription is trying to make a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to [[Moses]] \u2013 where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiah's forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt.{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Covenant ===\n{{see also|Covenant (biblical)}}\nMuch of Jeremiah's prophetic preaching is based on the theme of the covenant between God and Israel (God would protect the people in return for their exclusive worship of him): Jeremiah insists that the covenant is conditional, and can be broken by Israel's apostasy (worship of gods other than [[Yahweh]], the God of Israel). The people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness makes judgement inevitable. Interspersed with this are references to repentance and renewal, although it is unclear whether Jeremiah thought that repentance could ward off judgement or whether it would have to follow judgement. The theme of restoration is strongest in chapter 31:32, which looks to a future in which a new covenant made with Israel and Judah, one which will not be broken.{{sfn|Biddle|2009|p=1074}} This is the theme of the \"new covenant\" passage at chapter 31:31\u201334, drawing on Israel's past relationship with God through the covenant at Sinai to foresee a new future in which Israel will be obedient to God.{{sfn|Davidson|1993|p=347}}\n\n=== The \"Confessions\" of Jeremiah ===\nScholars have identified several passages in Jeremiah that can be understood as \"confessions;\" they occur in the first section of the book (chapters 1\u201325) and are 11:18\u201312.6, 15:10\u201321, 17:14\u201318, 18:18\u201323, and 20:7\u201318. In these passages, Jeremiah expresses his discontent with the message he is to deliver, but also his steadfast commitment to the divine call despite the fact that he had not sought it out. Additionally, in several of these \"confessions,\" Jeremiah prays that the Lord will take revenge on his persecutors (for example, Jeremiah 12.3).{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=303}}\n\nJeremiah's \"confessions\" are a type of individual [[lament]]. Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the [[Book of Job]]. Like Job, Jeremiah curses the day of his birth (Jer. 20:14\u201318 and Job 3:3\u201310). Likewise, Jeremiah's exclamation \"For I hear the whispering of many: Terror is all around!\" (Jer. 20:10) matches Psalm 31:13 exactly. However, Jeremiah's laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages.{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=303}} These laments \"provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering\".{{sfn|Perdue|2009|p=1021}}\n\n=== Prophetic gestures ===\nProphetic gestures, also known as sign-acts or symbolic actions, was a form of communication in which a message was delivered by performing symbolic actions.{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=303}} Not unique to the book of Jeremiah, these were often bizarre and violated the cultural norms of the time (e.g. Ezekiel 4:4\u20138). They served the purposes of both drawing audience and causing that audience to ask questions, giving a prophet the opportunity to explain the meaning of the behavior. The recorder of the events in the written text (i.e. the author of the text) had neither the same audience nor, potentially, the same intent that Jeremiah had in performing these prophetic gestures.{{sfn|Friebel|1999|p=13}}\n\nThe following is a list \u2013 not exhaustive \u2013 of noteworthy sign-acts found in Jeremiah:{{sfn|Friebel|1999|pp=88\u2013136}}\n*'''Jeremiah 13:1\u201311''' The wearing, burial, and retrieval of a linen waistband.\n*'''Jeremiah 16:1\u20139''' The shunning of the expected customs of marriage, mourning, and general celebration.\n*'''Jeremiah 19:1\u201313''' the acquisition of a clay jug and the breaking of said jug in front of the religious leaders of Jerusalem.\n*'''Jeremiah 27\u201328''' The wearing of an oxen yoke and its subsequent breaking by a false prophet, Hananiah.\n*'''Jeremiah 32:6\u201315''' The purchase of a field in Anathoth for the price of seventeen silver shekels.\n*'''Jeremiah 35:1\u201319''' The offering of wine to the Rechabites, a tribe known for living in tents and refusing to drink wine. This was done in the Temple, which is an important part of the breaking of societal norms.\n\n== Later interpretation and influence ==\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe influence of Jeremiah during and after the Exile was considerable in some circles, and three additional books, the [[Book of Baruch]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]], were attributed to him in [[Second Temple Judaism]] (Judaism in the period between the building of the Second Temple in about 515 BCE and its destruction in 70 CE); in the Greek [[Septuagint]] they stand between Jeremiah and the [[Book of Ezekiel]], but only Lamentations is included in modern Jewish or Protestant bibles (the Letter of Jeremiah appears in Catholic bibles as the sixth chapter of Baruch).{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=132\u201333}} Jeremiah is mentioned by name in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and the [[Book of Ezra]], both dating from the later [[Yehud medinata|Persian period]], and his prophecy that the [[Babylonian exile]] would last 70 years was taken up and reapplied by the author of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the 2nd century BCE.\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe understanding of the [[early Christians]] that [[Jesus]] represented a \"[[new covenant]]\" (see 1 Corinthians 11:25 and Hebrews 8:6\u201313) is based on Jeremiah 31:31\u201334, in which a future Israel will repent and give God the obedience he demands.{{sfn|Davidson|1993|p=347}} The Gospel's portrayal of Jesus as a persecuted prophet owes a great deal to the account of Jeremiah's sufferings in chapters 37\u201344, as well as to the \"[[Songs of the Suffering Servant]]\" in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=134}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nebo-Sarsekim Tablet]]\n\n== Citations
