He is best known for his 1971 song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\", which was a number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 and stayed put at 2 for 3 weeks in the UK, as well as a hit for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2000. McLean's other well-known songs include: \"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]\", sung by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Perry Como]], [[Helen Reddy]], and [[Glen Campbell]], among others; \"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]\", a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter [[Vincent van Gogh]]; \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\", a cover of the [[Roy Orbison]] song and a surprise number 1 hit in the United Kingdom in 1980; and \"[[Castles in the Air (song)|Castles in the Air]]\", which McLean recorded twice. In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Musical roots==\nMcLean's grandfather and father, both also named Donald McLean, had roots originating in [[Scotland]]. The Buccis, the family of McLean's mother, Elizabeth, came from [[Abruzzo]] in [[central Italy]]. They left Italy and settled in [[Port Chester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], at the end of the 19th century. He has other extended family in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Boston]].<ref name=bio>{{cite book|title=The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs|last=Howard|first=Alan|year=2007|publisher=Lulu Press|isbn=978-1-4303-0682-5|page=420}}</ref>\n\nThough some of his early musical influences included [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Buddy Holly]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title=Bye-Bye, Mr. 'American Pie': Don McLean Gives His Pen a Rest|last=Arnold|first=Thomas|date=March 23, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> as a teenager, McLean became interested in [[folk music]], particularly the [[the Weavers|Weavers]]' 1955 recording ''[[The Weavers at Carnegie Hall|At Carnegie Hall]]''. He often missed long periods of school because of childhood [[asthma]], particularly music lessons, and although McLean slipped back in his studies, his love of music was allowed to flourish. By age 16, he had bought his first guitar and began making contacts in the music business, becoming friends with the folk singers [[Erik Darling]] and [[Fred Hellerman]] of the Weavers. Hellerman said, \"He called me one day and said, 'I'd like to come and visit you', and that's what he did! We became good friends \u2014 he has the most remarkable music memory of anyone I've ever known.\"<ref name=bio/>\n\nWhen McLean was 15, his father died. Fulfilling his father's request, the singer graduated from [[Iona Preparatory School]] in 1963,<ref name=\":0\"/> and briefly attended [[Villanova University]], dropping out after four months. After leaving Villanova, McLean became associated with the famed [[folk music]] agent [[Harold Leventhal]] for several months before teaming up with his personal manager, Herb Gart, for 18 years. For the next six years he performed at venues and events including [[The Bitter End]] and the [[the Gaslight Cafe|Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, the [[Newport Folk Festival]], the [[the Cellar Door|Cellar Door]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[the Troubadour (Los Angeles)|Troubadour]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=bio/> He attended [[night school]] at [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] in 1968.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://don-mclean.com/2013/08/12/about-don-mclean/|title=About Don McLean|date=August 12, 2013|work=Don McLean|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHe turned down a scholarship to [[Columbia University]] Graduate School in favor of pursuing a career as a [[singer-songwriter]], performing at such venues as [[Caff\u00e8 Lena]] in, [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], and the [[The Main Point|Main Point]], in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]].\n\nLater that year, with the help of a grant from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], McLean began reaching a wider audience, with visits to towns up and down the [[Hudson River]].<ref name=bio/> He learned the art of performing from his friend and mentor [[Pete Seeger]]. McLean accompanied Seeger on his [[Sloop Clearwater|Clearwater]] boat trip up the Hudson River in 1969 to raise awareness about environmental pollution in the river. During this time McLean wrote songs that would appear on his first album, ''[[Tapestry (Don McLean album)|Tapestry]]''. McLean co-edited the book ''Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew'', with sketches by [[Thomas B. Allen (painter)|Thomas B. Allen]], for which Pete Seeger wrote the foreword. Seeger and McLean sang \"[[Oh Shenandoah|Shenandoah]]\" on the 1974 Clearwater album.\n\n==Recording career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Early breakthrough===\nMcLean recorded ''Tapestry'' in 1969 in [[Berkeley, California]], during the student riots.  After being rejected 72 times by labels, the album was released by [[Mediarts]], a label that had not existed when he first started to look for a label. He worked on the album for a couple of years before putting it out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/don-mclean-interview-2017.htm|title=Special Interview With Don McLean, Renowned Singer/Songwriter Of \"American Pie\" and Other Classic Songs|date=July 3, 2017|work=Songwriter Universe {{!}} Songwriting News, Articles & Song Contest|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> It attracted good reviews but little notice outside the folk community, though on the Easy Listening chart \"[[Castles in the Air (song)|Castles in the Air]]\" was a success, and in 1973 \"And I Love You So\" became a number 1 Adult Contemporary hit for [[Perry Como]].\n\nMcLean's major break came when Mediarts was taken over by [[United Artists Records]], thus securing the promotion of a major label for his second album, ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]].''  The album launched two number one hits in the title song and \"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]\". ''American Pie''&#39;s success made McLean an international star and piqued interest in his first album, which charted more than two years after its initial release.\n\n===\"American Pie\"===\n{{Main|American Pie (song)}}\nMcLean's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\", is a sprawling, impressionistic ballad inspired partly by the deaths of [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and J.P. Richardson ([[The Big Bopper]]) in a plane crash in 1959, and developments in American youth culture in the subsequent decade. The song popularized the expression \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\" in reference to the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean?from=Main.DonMcLean|title=Don McLean (Music)|publisher=TV Tropes|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe song was recorded on May 26, 1971, and a month later received its first radio airplay on New York's WNEW-FM and WPLJ-FM to mark the closing of [[Fillmore East]], the famous New York concert hall.  \"American Pie\" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] from January 15 to February 5, 1972, and remains McLean's most successful single release. The single also topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] chart. With a total running time of 8:36 encompassing both sides of the single, it is also the longest song to reach number 1. Some stations played only part one of the original split-sided single release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1193|title=American Pie by Don McLean Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] DJ Bob Dearborn unraveled the lyrics and first published his interpretation on January 7, 1972, eight days before the song reached number 1 nationally (see \"Further reading\" under [[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]). Numerous other interpretations, which together largely converged on Dearborn's interpretation, quickly followed. McLean declined to say anything definitive about the lyrics until 1978.<ref>However, [[Casey Kasem]] confirmed the main outline of what Dearborn had said and seemed to indicate that McLean agreed with that outline, on the January 15, 1972, edition of ''[[American Top 40]]'', when \"American Pie\" had just ascended to number 1 on the Hot 100.</ref>  Since then McLean has stated that the lyrics are also somewhat autobiographical and present an abstract story of his life from the mid-1950s until the time he wrote the song in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp|title=Don McLean's American Pie|work=Don McLean Online - The Official Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222185354/http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp|archivedate=December 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 \"American Pie\" was voted number 5 in a poll of the 365 [[Songs of the Century]] compiled by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].\n\nOn April 7, 2015, McLean\u2019s original working manuscript for \"American Pie\" sold for $1,205,000 (\u00a3809,524/\u20ac1,109,182) at Christie\u2019s auction rooms, New York, making it the third highest auction price achieved for an American literary manuscript.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/salelanding/index.aspx?intSaleID=25290|title=Don McLean's \"American Pie\": The Original Lyrics|publisher=Christies.com|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent recordings===\n[[File:Don McLean 1976.JPG|thumb|McLean in a publicity photo, 1976]]\nPersonnel from the ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' album sessions were retained for his third album, ''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'', including the producer, Ed Freeman, [[Rob Stoner|Rob Rothstein]] on bass and [[Warren Bernhardt]] on piano. The song \"The Pride Parade\" provides an insight into McLean's immediate reaction to stardom. McLean told ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1973 that ''Tapestry'' was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' combines externals with internals and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') entirely introspective.\"\n\nOther songs written by McLean for the album include \"Dreidel\" (number 21 on the Billboard chart) and \"If We Try\" (number 58), which was subsequently recorded by [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref>''[[The Great Olivia Newton-John]]'', Festival Records, 1999.</ref> \"On the Amazon\" from the 1920s musical [[Mr Cinders]] was an unusual choice but became an audience favorite in concerts and featured in ''Till Tomorrow'', a documentary film about McLean produced by Bob Elfstrom (Elfstrom held the role of Jesus Christ in Johnny and June Cash's ''Gospel Road)''. The film shows McLean in concert at Columbia University as he was interrupted by a bomb scare. He left the stage while the audience stood up and checked under their seats for anything that resembled a bomb. After the all-clear, McLean re-appeared and sang \"On the Amazon\" from exactly where he had left off. Don Heckman reported the bomb scare in his review for ''The New York Times'' entitled \"Don McLean Survives Two Obstacles.\"<ref>''New York Times'', December 12, 1971</ref>\n\nThe fourth album, ''[[Playin' Favorites]]'' was a top-40 hit in the UK in 1973 and included the Irish folk classic, \"Mountains of Mourne\" and [[Buddy Holly]]'s \"[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]\", a live rendition of which returned McLean to the [[UK Singles Chart]]. McLean said, \"The last album (''[[Don McLean (album)|Don McLean]]'') was a study in depression whereas the new one (''[[Playin' Favorites]]'') is almost the quintessence of optimism.\"\n\nThe 1974 album ''[[Homeless Brother]]'', produced by [[Joel Dorn]], was McLean's final studio recording for United Artists. The album featured fine New York session musicians, including Ralph McDonald on percussion, [[Hugh McCracken]] on guitar and a guest appearance by [[Yusef Lateef]] on flute. The [[The Persuasions|Persuasions]] sang the background vocals on \"Crying in the Chapel\", and [[Cissy Houston]] provided a backing vocal on \"La La Love You\". The album's title song was inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s book ''[[Lonesome Traveler]]'', in which Kerouac tells the story of America's \"homeless brothers\", or hobos. The song features background vocals by [[Pete Seeger]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/homeless-brother-mw0000046874|title=Homeless Brother: Don McLean {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"The Legend of Andrew McCrew\" was based on an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref name=bio/> concerning a black Dallas hobo named Anderson McCrew who was killed when he leapt from a moving train. No one claimed him, so a carnival took his body, mummified it, and toured all over the South with him, calling him \"The Famous Mummy Man.\" McLean's song inspired radio station WGN in Chicago to tell the story and give the song airplay in order to raise money for a headstone for McCrew's grave. Their campaign was successful, and McCrew's body was exhumed and buried in the Lincoln Cemetery in Dallas.<ref>''Ellensburg Daily Record'', May 24, 1974.</ref> The tombstone had an inscription with words from the fourth verse of McLean's song:\n\n<blockquote>What a way to live a life, and what a way to die<br/>\nLeft to live a living death with no one left to cry<br/>\nA petrified amazement, a wonder beyond worth<br/>\nA man who found more life in death than life gave him at birth</blockquote>\n\n[[Joel Dorn]] later collaborated on the McLean career retrospective ''[[Rearview Mirror: An American Musical Journey|Rearview Mirror]]'', released in 2005 on Dorn's label, Hyena Records. In 2006, Dorn reflected on working with McLean:<ref name=bio/><blockquote>Of the more than 200 studio albums I've produced in the past forty plus years, there is a handful; maybe fifteen or so that I can actually listen to from top to bottom. ''[[Homeless Brother]]'' is one of them. It accomplished everything I set out to do. And it did so because it was a true collaboration. Don brought so much to the project that all I really had to do was capture what he did, and complement it properly when necessary.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1977 a brief liaison with [[Arista Records]] that yielded the album ''[[Prime Time (Don McLean album)|Prime Time]]'' and, in October 1978, the single \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\". This was a track from the album ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' that should have been the second of four with Arista.<ref name=bio/> McLean had started recording in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], with [[Elvis Presley]]'s backing singers, the [[The Jordanaires|Jordanaires]], and many of Presey's musicians. However the Arista deal broke down following artistic disagreements between McLean and the Arista chief, [[Clive Davis]]. Consequently, McLean was left without a record contract in the United States, but through continuing deals, ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' was released by EMI in Europe and by Festival Records in Australia.\n\nIn April 1980, the Roy Orbison song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" from the album began picking up airplay on Dutch radio stations and McLean was called to Europe to appear on several important musical variety shows to plug the song and support its release as a single by EMI. The song achieved number 1 status in the Netherlands first, followed by the UK and then Australia.\n\nMcLean's number 1 successes in Europe and Australia led to a new deal in the United States with Millennium Records, which issued ''[[Chain Lightning (album)|Chain Lightning]]'' two and a half years after it had been recorded in Nashville and two years after its release in Europe. It charted on February 14, 1981, and reached number 28, while \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" climbed to number 5 on the pop singles chart. Orbison himself thought that McLean\u2019s version was the best interpretation he\u2019d ever heard of one of his songs. Orbison thought McLean did a better job than he did and even went so far as to say that the voice of Don McLean is one of the great instruments of 20th-century America.<ref name=skydoc>{{cite AV media|title=Don McLean: An American Troubadour|medium=Television production|publisher=Sky Arts 1|location=UK|year=2013}}</ref> According to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, \"McLean's voice could cut through steel - he is a very pure singer and he's up there with the best of them. He's a very talented singer and songwriter and he deserves his success.\"<ref name=skydoc/>\n\nMcLean had further chart successes in the United States in the early 1980s with \"[[Since I Don't Have You]]\", a new recording of \"Castles in the Air\" and \"It's Just the Sun\". In 1987, the release of the country-based album''[[Love Tracks (Don McLean album)|Love Tracks]]'' gave rise to the hit singles \"Love in My Heart\" (a top-10 in Australia), \"[[You Can't Blame the Train]]\" (U.S. country number 49), and \"Eventually\". The latter two songs were written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]]. In 1991, [[EMI]] reissued \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\" as a single in the United Kingdom, and McLean performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In 1992, previously unreleased songs became available on ''[[Favorites and Rarities]]'', while ''Don McLean Classics'' featured new studio recordings of \"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]\" and \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nMcLean has continued to record new material, including ''River of Love'' in 1995 on [[Curb Records]] and, more recently, the albums ''You've Got to Share'', ''Don McLean Sings Marty Robbins'' and ''The Western Album'' for his own Don McLean Music label. ''Addicted to Black'' was released in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320 |title=Don McLean Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123224947/http://www.don-mclean.com/?p=320|archivedate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Other songs===\nMcLean's other well-known songs include the following.\n*\"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]\" was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], and a [[1973 in music|1973 hit]] for [[Perry Como]].\n*\"[[Vincent (song)|Vincent]]\", a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter, [[Vincent van Gogh]].

the name of its main character. The series is a [[gag-a-day]] comic.\n\n==Description==\n\nDirkJan is a loser who stumbles through life in mostly three-panel [[gag-a-day]] comic strips. He started out in 1989 as a student at the current [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] <ref>https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/retera_mark.htm</ref>  in the Netherlands, where he lived in a typical student house with all the stereotypical side-kicks, such as the fat boy, the beer drinker, the bossy girl who checks if everybody keeps to the house rules, and the tramps who use the heated shared hallway to stay the night. Early DirkJans contained many references to the student life of [[Nijmegen]].\n\n==Publication==\n\nDirkJan was first published in ''Critic'', the magazine for the local union of psychology students. It then moved on to monthly publication in the student magazine of Nijmegen ([[Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad]], ANS). DirkJan became known nationally when the then only commercial comics magazine of the Netherlands SjoSji (now defunct) started publishing the strip. <ref>https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/retera_mark.htm</ref> \n\nWith the last move, the nature of the strip changed. Most of the student side-kicks got cancelled and DirkJan left university, first for jail (DJ is a notorious [[Kabouter]] abuser) and then to wander the globe and indeed space.\n\nAs of November 2016, there are 22 DirkJan albums, tentatively named 'DirkJan 1' through 'DirkJan 22'. Several newspapers in the [[Netherlands]] publish the comic in their daily edition.\n\nThe amateur comics magazine [[Iris magazine|Iris]] (1990 - 1995) (re)published a number of DirkJan comics, some of which were refused for publication in SjoSji.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.comichouse.nl/en/illustration/2d/retera/ Portfolio of Mark Retera]\n* http://www.mooves.nl/ (two animated DirkJan strips, Flash-only site)\n\n[[Category:Dutch comics characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional Dutch people]]\n[[Category:Dutch comic strips]]\n[[Category:Gag-a-day comics]]\n[[Category:1989 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Comics set in the Netherlands]]\n\n\n{{comic-strip-stub}}", "sha1": "evnjeio2pcjj8o9s54h6a41t8nso1l8"}}, {"title": "Duck Hunt", "ns": "0", "id": "8993", "revision": {"id": "863965255", "parentid": "863965226", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T07:08:02Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dissident93", "id": "16761480"}, "comment": "strange thing to say", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the 1984 Nintendo game|the 1969 Sega game|Light gun shooter|the sport|Duck hunting}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Duck Hunt\n|image=DuckHuntBox.jpg\n|alt = North American NES box art of ''Duck Hunt''.\n|caption=North American box art\n|developer=[[Nintendo Research & Development 1]]\n|publisher=[[Nintendo]]\n|producer=[[Gunpei Yokoi]]\n|artist=[[Hiroji Kiyotake]]\n|designer= \n|composer = [[Hirokazu Tanaka]]\n|engine=\n|released= '''NES''' {{vgrelease|JP|April 21, 1984<ref>{{cite journal |title=retrodiary: 1&nbsp;April \u2013 28&nbsp;April |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=[[Bournemouth]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=17 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015}}</ref>|NA|October 18, 1985|EU|August 15, 1987}}\n|genre=[[Light gun shooter]], [[Sports game|sports]]\n|modes=[[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Two-player video game|Two-Player]]\n|platforms=[[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Duck Hunt'''''|\u30c0\u30c3\u30af\u30cf\u30f3\u30c8|Dakku Hanto|lead=yes}} is a 1984 [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) [[video game console]]. The game was first released in Japan in April 1984, and was released as a [[launch game]] for the NES in North America in October 1985, with it also releasing in Europe two years later.\n\nIn ''Duck Hunt'', players use the [[NES Zapper]] to shoot [[duck]]s that appear on the television screen. The ducks appear one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. The player receives points upon shooting each duck. If the player shoots the required number of ducks in a single [[level (video gaming)|round]], the player will advance to the next round; otherwise, the player will receive a [[game over]].\n\nThe game initially received few reviews, but was given mild critical praise.<ref name=\"Allgame review\"/><ref name=\"Gamespot people\"/> Prior to the NES version, Nintendo also made a ''Duck Hunt'' game based on [[Laser Clay Shooting System]] released in 1976.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073933/http://www.japan-games.com/Database/images/Nintendo/TV-Game/Duckhunt/index.htm Nintendo Duck Hunt (1976)]</ref> It was later a [[pack-in game]], paired with ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''; the pack later also included ''[[Stadium Events|World Class Track Meet]]''.

In all modes, the player has three attempts to shoot the on-screen targets when they appear.}}\n\n''Duck Hunt'' is a [[shooter game]] in which the objective is to shoot moving targets on the television screen in mid-flight. The game is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective and requires the [[NES Zapper]] [[light gun]], which the player aims and fires at the screen. Each [[Level (video gaming)|round]] consists of a total of ten targets to shoot. Depending on the [[Game mechanics#Game modes|game mode]] the player selects prior to beginning play, one or two targets will appear on the screen at any given time and the player has three shots, or attempts, to hit them before they disappear.<ref name=\"Duck Hunt rules\">{{cite web|title='Duck Hunt' |url=http://www.nindb.net/game/duck-hunt.html |accessdate=2006-11-21 |date= |work=NinDB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619100111/https://nindb.net/game/duck-hunt.html |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe player is required to successfully shoot a minimum number of targets in order to advance to the next round; failure will result in a [[game over]]. The [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty]] increases as the player advances to higher rounds; targets will move faster and the minimum number of targets to shoot will increase. The player receives [[Score (game)|points]] upon shooting a target and will also receive bonus points for shooting all ten targets in a single round. ''Duck Hunt'' keeps track of the players' [[Score (game)#High score|highest score]] for all games played in a single session; it is lost, however, upon shutting the game off.\n\n''Duck Hunt'' has three different game modes to choose from. In \"Game A\" and \"Game B\", the targets are flying [[duck]]s in a woodland area, and in \"Game C\" the targets are [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeon]]s that are fired away from the player's perspective into the distance. In \"Game A\", one duck will appear on the screen at a time while in \"Game B\" two ducks will appear at a time.<ref name=\"Duck Hunt rules\"/> \"Game A\" allows a [[multiplayer|second player]] to control the movement of the flying ducks by using a normal [[Nintendo Entertainment System#Controllers|NES controller]].<ref name=\"cheats\">{{cite web |url=http://cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/007/007158.html |title=Duck Hunt Cheats |accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=IGN}}</ref> The gameplay starts at Round 1 and may continue up to Round 99. If the player completes Round 99, he or she will advance to Round 0, which is a [[kill screen]] (in \"Game A\") where the game behaves erratically, such as targets that move haphazardly or don't appear at all, and eventually ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://satoshimatrix.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/top-100-nesfamicom-games-list-100-90/ |title=Top 100 NES/Famicom Games List #100-90 |work=Retro and Contemporary Gaming Archives |date=2011-08-17}}</ref>\n\n===''Vs.

In addition, the player is given a limited number of lives; every duck/target that is not hit costs one life. When all lives are gone, the game ends.\n\nAfter every second round, a bonus stage is played in which ducks can be shot for points as they fly out of the grass. However, the [[hunting dog]] occasionally jumps out, putting himself in the line of fire and creating a distraction. If the player shoots the dog, the bonus stage immediately ends.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Nintendo-Entertainment-System-NES-Zapper-Gray-R.jpg|thumb|The [[NES Zapper]] is required for playing ''Duck Hunt''.]]\n''Duck Hunt'' is based on a 1976 electronic toy version titled ''Beam Gun: Duck Hunt'', part of the ''Beam Gun'' series.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/02/video_1976_duck/|title=Video: 1976 Duck Hunt|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=27 February 2007|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> The toy version was designed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] and [[Masayuki Uemura]] for Nintendo.<ref name=\"wired\"/> [[Nintendo Research & Development 1]] developed both ''Duck Hunt'' for the NES and the [[NES Zapper]].

It has been exhibited both as a [[theatrical release]] and as a TV [[miniseries]] (1985), in several different [[home video]] versions of various running times, and in a [[director's cut]] version supervised by Petersen in 1997.\n\nAn [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]]'s 1973 German novel of the same name, the film is set during [[World War II]] and tells the fictional story of [[U-boat#World War II (1939\u20131945)|U-boat]] [[German submarine U-96 (1940)|U-96]] and its crew, as they set out on yet another hazardous patrol in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard [[U-boat#World War II|U-boats]] as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country.\n\nDevelopment began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier before the film was shelved. During production, [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real'' U-96'' and one of Germany's top U-boat \"tonnage aces\" during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on {{GS|U-219||2}}, served as consultants. One of Petersen's goals was to guide the audience through \"a journey to the edge of the mind\" (the film's German tagline ''Eine Reise ans Ende des Verstandes''), showing \"what war is all about\".\n\nProduced with a budget of 32 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] (about $18.5 million), the film's high production cost ranks it among the most expensive films in the history of [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]]. It was the second most expensive up until that time, after ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. The film enjoyed financial success and grossed over $80 million worldwide. [[Columbia Pictures]] released both a German version and an English-dubbed version in the United States theatrically, but the film's German version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box office.<ref name=\"indiewire.com\">http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/</ref><ref name=\"Archived copy\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html |archive-date=5 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  The film received highly positive reviews and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], two of which (for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]) went to Petersen himself; he was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]] and [[DGA Award]]. Today, the film is seen as [[Films considered the greatest ever#Germany|one of the greatest of all German films]].\n\n==Plot==\nLt. Werner ([[Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer]]), has been assigned as a [[war correspondent]] on the {{GS|U-96|1940|6}} in October 1941. He  is driven by its captain ([[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]), and chief engineer ([[Klaus Wennemann]]), to a raucous French bordello where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen ([[Otto Sander]]), another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|''Ritterkreuz'' award]], in which he openly mocks not only [[Winston Churchill]] but implicitly [[Adolf Hitler]] as well.\n\nThe next morning, they sail out of the [[harbour]] of [[La Rochelle]] to a cheering crowd and playing band. Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are often mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British [[destroyer]], and are bombarded with [[depth charge]]s. They escape with only light damage.\n\nThe next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless North Atlantic gale. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British [[convoy]] and quickly launches four torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the [[Submarine depth ratings|submarine's rated limit]]. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn there are still sailors aboard. The U-boat men watch in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unable to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat away.\n\nThe worn-out U-boat crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle in time for [[Christmas]], but the ship is ordered to [[La Spezia]], Italy, which means passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]\u2014an area heavily defended by the [[Royal Navy]]. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of [[Vigo]], in [[Neutral country|neutral]] although [[Francoist Spain|Axis-friendly Spain]], with the [[SS Weser|SS ''Weser'']], an [[interned]] German [[merchant ship]] that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy officers seem out of place at the opulent dinner prepared for them, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the Chief Engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.\n\nThe crew finishes resupplying and departs for Italy. As they carefully approach the Straits of Gibraltar and are just about to dive, they are suddenly bombed and strafed by a British [[fighter plane]], wounding the navigator. The captain orders his damaged boat directly south towards the North African coast at full speed determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just before being crushed by the pressure, it lands on a sea shelf, at the depth of 280 metres. The crew works desperately to make numerous repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they are able to surface by blowing their [[ballast tank|ballast]] tanks, and with a badly damaged boat limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness with only one engine still operational.\n\nThe crew is exhausted when they finally reach La Rochelle on [[Christmas Eve]]. Shortly after the wounded navigator is taken ashore to a waiting ambulance, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann, the 2nd Watch Officer, and the Bibelforscher are killed. Frenssen, ''Bootsmann'' Lamprecht and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the [[submarine pen|U-boat bunker]] in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink at the dock. Just after the boat disappears under the water, the captain collapses and dies. Werner runs to the captain's lifeless body, recoils, and quickly glances around at the destruction, and back to the captain's body, his face frozen with distress, and with tears in his eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:DasBootcast.png|thumb|right|The U-96 officers.

DVD.</ref> He is openly anti-Nazi, and embittered and cynical about the war.\n* [[Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer]] as ''Leutnant'' (Ensign) Werner, War Correspondent: Naive but honest, he has been sent out to sea with the crew to gather photographs of them in action and report on the voyage. Werner is mocked for his lack of experience, and soon learns the true horrors of service on a U-boat.\n* [[Klaus Wennemann]] as Chief Engineer (''[[Leitender Ingenieur]]'' or LI, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A quiet and well-respected man. At age 27, the oldest crew member besides the Captain. Tormented by the uncertain fate of his wife, especially after hearing about an [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Allied air raid]] on [[Cologne]]. The second most important crewman, as he oversees diving operations and makes sure the systems are running correctly.\n* [[Hubertus Bengsch]] as 1st Watch Officer (I. WO, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A young, by-the-book officer, an ardent Nazi and a staunch believer in the [[Endsieg]]. He has a condescending attitude and is the only crewman who makes the effort to maintain his proper uniform and trim appearance while all the others grow their beards in the traditional fashion. He was raised in some wealth in Mexico by his stepparents who owned a plantation. His German fianc\u00e9e died in a British air raid. He spends his days writing his thoughts on military training and leadership for the High Command. When the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar, he becomes pessimistic and begins to let go of his adherence to Nazi ideas as he finally stops shaving every day and wearing his proper uniform all the time. \n* [[Martin Semmelrogge]] as 2nd Watch Officer (II. WO, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A vulgar, comedic officer. He is short, red-haired and speaks with a mild [[Berlinerisch dialect|Berlin dialect]]. One of his duties is to decode messages from base, using the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code machine]]. \n* [[Bernd Tauber]] as ''Obersteuermann'' (\"Chief Helmsman\") Kriechbaum: The navigator and 3rd Watch Officer (III. WO). Always slightly skeptical of the Captain and without enthusiasm during the voyage, he shows no anger when a convoy is too far away to be attacked. Kriechbaum has four sons, with another on the way.\n* [[Erwin Leder]] as ''Obermaschinist'' (\"Chief Mechanic\") Johann, also called \"Das Gespenst\" (\"The Ghost\"): He is obsessed with a near-fetish love for the ''U-96''{{'}}s engines. Johann suffers a temporary mental breakdown during an attack by two destroyers. He is able to redeem himself by valiantly working to stop water leaks when the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar. Speaks [[Austro-Bavarian language|a lower Austrian dialect]].  His character is based on [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] recipient [[Hans Johannsen]].\n* [[Martin May (actor)|Martin May]] as ''F\u00e4hnrich'' (Senior Cadet) Ullmann: A young officer candidate who has a pregnant [[French people|French]] fianc\u00e9e (which is considered treason by the French [[French Resistance|partisans]]) and worries about her safety. He is one of the few crew members with whom Werner is able to connect; Werner offers to deliver Ullmann's stack of love letters when Werner is ordered to leave the submarine.\n* [[Heinz Hoenig]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Hinrich: The radioman, sonar controller and ship's [[combat medic]]. He gauges speed and direction of targets and enemy destroyers. Hinrich is one of the few crewmen that the Captain is able to relate to.\n* [[Uwe Ochsenknecht]] as ''Bootsmann'' (\"Boatswain\") Lamprecht: The severe chief petty officer who shows Werner around the ''U-96'', and supervises the firing and reloading of the torpedo tubes. He gets upset after hearing on the radio that the football team most of the crew supports ([[FC Schalke 04]]) are losing a match, and they will \"never make the final now\". \n* Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Ario: The burly mechanic who tells everyone that Dufte is getting married to an ugly woman, and throws pictures around of Dufte's fianc\u00e9e in order to laugh at them both.\n* [[Jan Fedder]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Pilgrim: Another sailor (watch officer and diving planes operator), gets almost swept off the submarine during a storm - a genuine accident during filming in which Fedder broke several ribs and was hospitalised for a while. \n* [[Ralf Richter (actor)|Ralf Richter]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Frenssen: Pilgrim's best friend. Pilgrim and Frenssen love to trade dirty jokes and stories. \n* Joachim Bernhard as ''Bibelforscher'' (\"Bible scholar\", also the contemporary German term for a member of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]): A very young religious sailor who is constantly reading the Bible. He is punched by Frenssen when the submarine is trapped at the bottom of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] for praying rather than repairing the boat.\n* [[Oliver Stritzel]] as Schwalle: A tall and well-built blond torpedoman.\n* Jean-Claude Hoffmann as Benjamin: A red haired sailor who serves as a diving plane operator.\n* Lutz Schnell as Dufte: The sailor who gets jeered at because he is getting married, and for a possible false airplane sighting.\n* [[Konrad Becker]] as B\u00f6ckstiegel: the sailor who is first visited by Hinrich for crab lice. \n* [[Otto Sander]] as ''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'' Philipp Thomsen: An alcoholic and [[combat stress reaction|shell-shocked]] U-boat commander, who is a member of \"The Old Guard\". When he is introduced, he is extremely drunk and briefly mocks both Hitler and Winston Churchill on the stage of the French bordello. (In the \"Director's Cut\" DVD [[audio commentary]], Petersen says that Sander was really drunk while they were shooting the scene.) Sometime after ''U-96'' departs, Thomsen is deployed once again and the two submarines meet randomly in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] being put off course by the storm. This upsets the captain because it means that there is now a gap in the blockade chain. After failing to make contact later, it becomes apparent that Thomsen's boat is missing.\n* [[G\u00fcnter Lamprecht]] as the Captain of the ''Weser'' (rank: ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''): An enthusiastic officer aboard the resupply ship ''Weser''. He mistakes the I. WO for the Captain as they enter the ship's elegant dining room. An ardent [[Nazi]], he complains about the frustration of not being able to fight, but boasts about the food that has been prepared for the crew and the ship's \"specialities\".\n* [[Sky du Mont]] as an ''Oberleutnant'' aboard the ''Weser'' (uncredited). The II. WO amuses him with a comical demonstration of depth charging, involving a bowl of punch, a ladle and oranges.\n\nThe film features both Standard German-speakers and [[dialect]] speakers. Petersen states in the DVD audio commentary that young men from throughout Germany and Austria were recruited for the film, as he wanted faces and dialects that would accurately reflect the diversity of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], around 1941. All of the main actors are bilingual in German and English, and when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part (with the exception of Martin Semmelrogge, who only dubbed his own role in the Director's Cut). The German version is dubbed as well, as the film was shot \"silent\", because the dialogue spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the [[gyroscope]]s in the special camera developed for filming.  Interestingly, the film's German version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box office.<ref name=\"indiewire.com\"/><ref name=\"Archived copy\"/>\n\n==Production==\nDuring 1941, war correspondent [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]] joined {{GS|U-96|1940|2}} for a single patrol, in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref name=Uziel>{{cite book |author=Daniel Uziel |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=1pKnPzrPD7sC&pg=PA402&q=buchheim%20iron%20cross |title=The Propaganda Warriors: The Wehrmacht and the Consolidation of the German Home Front |location=Bern / Oxford |publisher=Lang |year=2008 |isbn=9783039115327 |page=402 }}</ref><ref name=Grauniad>{{cite news |author=Dan van der Vat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2026462,00.html |title=Obituary: Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim |date=March 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> His orders were to photograph and describe the [[U-boat]] in action. In 1973, Buchheim published a novel based on his wartime experiences, ''Das Boot'' (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a \"Leutnant Werner\". It became the best-selling German fiction work on the war.<ref name=Local/> The follow up sequel ''Die Festung'' by Buchheim hit the bookshelfs in 1995.<ref>http://www.zeit.de/1995/22/Der_Krieg_aus_dem_Naehkaestchen</ref>\n\nProduction of ''Das Boot'' took two years (1979\u20131981). Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere.\n\nProduction for this film originally began in 1976. Several American directors were considered, and the ''Kaleu'' (''Kapit\u00e4nleutnant'') was to be played by [[Robert Redford]]. Disagreements sprang up among various parties and the project was shelved. Another Hollywood production was attempted with other American directors in mind, this time with the ''Kaleu'' to be portrayed by [[Paul Newman]]. This effort primarily failed due to technical concerns, for example, how to film the close encounter of the two German submarines at sea during a storm.\n\nThe production included the construction of several models of different sizes, as well as a complete, detailed reconstruction of the interior of a {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}, a [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIC-class U-boat]].\n\n[[Hans-Joachim Krug]], former first officer on [[German submarine U-219|U-219]], served as a consultant, as did [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real [[German submarine U-96 (1940)|U-96]].\n\nThe director's meticulous attention to detail resulted in a historically accurate depiction. In the film, there is only one ardent Nazi in the crew of 40, namely the First Watch Officer (referred to comically in one scene as ''Unser [[Hitlerjugendf\u00fchrer]]'' or \"Our [[Hitler Youth]] Leader\"). The rest of the officers are either indifferent or openly anti-Nazi (the Captain).  The enlisted sailors and NCO are portrayed as apolitical. In his book ''[[Iron Coffins]]'', former U-boat commander [[Herbert A. Werner]] states that the selection of naval personnel based on their loyalty to the party only occurred later in the war (from 1943 onward)  when the U-boats were suffering high casualties and when morale was declining. Such a degree of skepticism may or may not have occurred. In support of ''Das Boot'' on this subject, U-Boat historian [[Michael Gannon (historian)|Michael Gannon]] maintains that the U-boat navy was one of the least pro-Nazi branches of the German armed forces.\n\nEven though the beginning and the end of the film occur in the port of [[La Rochelle]], it does not correspond historically. The [[submarine base]] in La Rochelle was not functional before November 1941, and at the time of the film the port was dried up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://francois.delboca.free.fr/fsbase.html |title=History of the submarine base of La Rochelle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326025951/http://francois.delboca.free.fr/fsbase.html |archivedate=26 March 2007 }}</ref> While [[Saint-Nazaire]] was the base used in the novel, the film was changed to La Rochelle because its appearance had not changed to such a large degree in the years since World War II.\n\n===Sets and models===\n[[File:Baselapallice08.jpg|thumb|[[U-boat pens]] at the harbor of [[La Rochelle]] (2007)<br />{{coord|46|9|32|N|1|12|33|W|type:landmark_scale:3000_region:FR|display=inline}}]]\n[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|[[U 995]], a U-boat of the version VII-C/41, at its exhibition in [[Laboe]] in 2004]]\n\nSeveral different sets were used. Two full-size mock-ups of a Type VIIC boat were built, one representing the portion above water for use in outdoor scenes, and the other a cylindrical tube on a motion mount for the interior scenes. The mock-ups were built according to U-boat plans from [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].\n\nThe outdoor mock-up was basically a shell propelled with a small engine, and stationed in La Rochelle, France and has a history of its own. One morning the production crew walked out to where they kept it afloat and found it missing. Someone had forgotten to inform the crew that an American filmmaker had rented the mock-up for his own film shooting in the area. This filmmaker was [[Steven Spielberg]] and the film he was shooting was ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Marcus Hearn | title =The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =Harry N. Abrams Inc, Publishers | year =2005 | location =[[New York City|New York]] | pages =127\u2013134| isbn =0-8109-4968-7}}</ref> A few weeks later, during production, the mock-up cracked in a storm and sank, was recovered and patched to stand in for the final scenes. The full-sized mock-up was used during the Gibraltar surface scenes; the attacking aircraft (played by a [[North American T-6 Texan]] / Harvard) and rockets were real while the British ships were models.\n\nA mock-up of a conning tower was placed in a water tank at the [[Bavaria Film Studios|Bavaria Studios]] in [[Munich]] for outdoor scenes not requiring a full view of the boat's exterior. When filming on the outdoor mockup or the conning tower, jets of cold water were hosed over the actors to simulate the breaking ocean waves. During the filming there was a scene where actor [[Jan Fedder]] (Pilgrim) fell off the bridge while the U-boat was surfaced. Fedder broke several ribs. This scene was not scripted and during the take one of the actors exclaims \"''Mann \u00fcber Bord!''\" in order to draw attention to Fedder. Petersen, who at first did not realise this was an accident said \"Good idea, Jan. We'll do that one more time!\" However, since Fedder was genuinely injured and had to be hospitalised, this was the only take available and eventually Petersen kept this scene in the film. In this scene, the pained expression on Fedder's face is authentic and not acted.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/trivia \"Das Boot\" on imdb.com]</ref> Petersen also had to rewrite Fedder's character for a portion of the film so that the character was portrayed as bedridden. For his scenes later in the film Fedder had to be brought to and from set from the hospital since he suffered a concussion while filming his accident scene. Fedder eventually recovered enough and Pilgrim is seen on his feet from the scene when the ''U-96'' abandons the British sailors. A half-sized full hull operating model was used for underwater shots and some surface running shots, in particular the meeting in stormy seas with another U-boat. The tank was also used for the shots of British sailors jumping from their ship; a small portion of the tanker hull was constructed for these shots.\n\n<gallery mode=packed style=\"text-align:left\" caption=\"Mock-up of the interior at the Bavaria Studios in Munich\">\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 1.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 4.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 5.jpg\nFile:Bavaria Filmstudio Das Boot 6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nThe interior U-boat mock-up was mounted five metres off the floor and was shaken, rocked, and tilted up to 45 degrees by means of a hydraulic apparatus, and was vigorously shaken to simulate depth charge attacks. Petersen was admittedly obsessive about the structural detail of the U-boat set, remarking that \"every screw\" in the set was an authentic facsimile of the kind used in a [[World War II]] U-boat. In this he was considerably assisted by the numerous photographs [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]] had taken during his own voyage on the historical ''U-96'', some of which had been published in his 1976 book, <cite>U-Boot-Krieg</cite> (\"U-Boat War\").\n\nThroughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out in sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions. The actors went through intensive training to learn how to move quickly through the narrow confines of the vessel.\n\n===Special camera===\nMost of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held [[Arriflex]] of cinematographer [[Jost Vacano]]'s design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had two gyroscopes to provide stability, a different and smaller scale solution than the [[Steadicam]], so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up.<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/19688881|title=SOC 2011 Historical Shot: Das Boot by Jost Vacano|work=Vimeo|accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Versions}}Different versions and home video==\nDirector Wolfgang Petersen has overseen the creation of several different versions of his film. The first to be released was the 149-minute theatrical cut, released to theatres in Germany in 1981 and America in 1982. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]] for ([[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Directing]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Sound]] ([[Milan Bor]], [[Trevor Pyke]] and [[Mike Le Mare]]), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Effects Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Writing]]).<ref name=\"Oscars1983\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1983 |title=The 55th Academy Awards (1983) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-10-09|work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n\nThe film was partly financed by German television broadcasters [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and the [[S\u00fcddeutscher Rundfunk|SDR]], and much more footage had been shot than was shown in the theatrical version. A version of three 100-minute episodes was transmitted on [[BBC Two]] in the United Kingdom in October 1984, and in Germany and Austria the following year. In 1984 on UK (German broadcast in 1985) television a 6 part series which is partially made of scenes from the movie was shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puremovies.co.uk/columns/das-boot-probably-the-biggest-german-blockbuster-of-all-time/|title=Das Boot \u2013 Probably the Biggest German Blockbuster of All Time  : Pure Movies|website=www.puremovies.co.uk}}</ref><ref>\nhttp://www.filmstarts.de/nachrichten/18516631.html</ref> In 1988 a version composed of six 50-minute episodes was screened. These episodes had additional flashback scenes summarising past episodes.\n\nPetersen then supervised the editing of six hours of film, from which was distilled a 209-minute version, ''Das Boot: The Director's Cut''. Released to cinemas worldwide in 1997, this cut combines the action sequences seen in the feature-length version with character development scenes contained in the mini-series. In addition, the audio and video quality was improved from that previously available.<ref>Official Das Boot website restoration information http://www.dasboot.com/classics.htm</ref> Petersen had originally planned to release this version in 1981, but for commercial reasons it was not possible. In 1998 it was released on DVD as a single-disc edition including an audio commentary by Petersen, lead actor J\u00fcrgen Prochnow and director's cut producer Ortwin Freyermuth; a 6-minute making-of featurette; and in most territories, the theatrical trailer. In 2003 it was also released as a \"[[Superbit]]\" edition with no extra features, but a superior quality higher bit-rate and the film spread across two discs.\n\nThe miniseries version was released on DVD in 2004, as ''Das Boot: The Original Uncut Version'', also with enhanced audio and video quality. It omits the episode opening flashback scenes of the 1988 television broadcast so is slightly shorter, running 293 minutes.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, the 208-minute \"Director's Cut\", along with various new extras, was released internationally on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/das-boot-the-director-s-cut-1798168781|title=Das Boot: The Director\u2019s Cut|first=Noel|last=Murray|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bluray-disc.de/blu-ray-filme/das-boot-blu-ray-disc | title = Das Boot (Directors Cut) Blu-ray | accessdate = 2014-03-16}}</ref> The American 2-disc Collector's Set also uniquely included the original 149-minute theatrical cut, which is otherwise unreleased on DVD or Blu-ray.\n\nIn 2014 the original miniseries, also known as \"The Original Uncut Version\", was released on Blu-ray in Germany with optional English audio and subtitles.\n\nFor both the \"Director's Cut\" and \"The Original Uncut Version\", new English language dubs were recorded featuring most of the original cast, who were bilingual.

Over 100,000 people visited the exhibition during its four-month run.\n\n===Criticism by novelist Buchheim===\nEven though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film's set-design and port construction buildings, novelist [[Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim]] expressed great disappointment with Petersen's adaptation in a film review<ref name=\"buchheim\">Lothar-G\u00fcnter Buchheim (1981).

Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided his own script as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director. It would have been a six-hour epic; Petersen turned him down because the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release. However, today's Director's Cut of ''Das Boot'' amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe characteristic lead melody of the soundtrack, composed and produced by [[Klaus Doldinger]], took on a life of its own after German [[rave]] group [[U96]] created a remixed \"techno version\" in 1991. The title theme \"[[Das Boot (song)|Das Boot]]\"<ref>{{discogs master|162882|Die Original Titelmelodie: Das Boot (Klaus Doldinger single)}}</ref> later became an international hit.\n\nThe official soundtrack<ref>{{discogs master|55391|Das Boot (Die original Filmmusik) (album)}}</ref> features only compositions by Doldinger, except for \"[[J'attendrai]]\" sung by [[Rina Ketty]]. The soundtrack (\"Filmmusik\") released following the release of ''The Director's Cut'' version omits \"J'attendrai\".\n\nSongs heard in the film, but not included on the album are \"[[La Paloma]]\" sung by [[Rosita Serrano]], the \"[[Erzherzog-Albrecht-Marsch]]\" (a popular military march), \"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\" performed by the [[MVD Ensemble|Red Army Chorus]], \"[[Heimat, Deine Sterne]]\" and the [[Westerwald#Westerwaldlied|Westerwald-Marsch]].\n\n== 2018 Television series ==\n{{main|Das Boot (television series)}}\nIn July 2016, it was announced that a television series remake of the film is in planning\n.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Hans|title=Das Boot Reboot|publisher=https://Handelsblatt Global|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/companies-markets/das-boot-reboot-789450}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/sky-deutschland-and-bavaria-team-up-on-big-budget-event-series-reprise-of-das-boot-1201777945/|title=\u2018Das Boot\u2019: Sky Deutschland & Bavaria Team On Big-Budget Event Series|date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n{{as of|2017|September|}}, the series is in production and is planned to premiere at the end of 2018 on multiple European channels of [[Sky plc]]\n.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/das-boot-tom-wlaschiha-vincent-kartheiser-james-darcy-thierry-fremont-cast-1202176377/|title=\u2018Das Boot\u2019: Tom Wlaschiha, Vincent Kartheiser, James D\u2019Arcy & Thierry Fr\u00e9mont Round Out Cast|date=2017-09-25}}</ref> It is being produced by Bavaria Fiction, Sky Deutschland and Sonar Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bavaria-fiction.de/en/productions/series/das-boot-die-serie|title=Das Boot -

Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.\n\nBy contrast, a [[dynamic web page]] is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones created by [[server-side scripting]] (such as [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] or [[ASP.NET]]) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.\n\nDHTML is differentiated from [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based. With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nDHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve, by changing the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) and page style. The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript offers ways to:\n\n* Animate text and images in their document.\n* Embed a ticker or other dynamic display that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.\n* Use a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data without having to send data back to the server.\n* Include rollover buttons or drop-down menus.\n\nA less common use is to create browser-based action games. Although a number of games were created using DHTML during the late 1990s and early 2000s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} differences between browsers made this difficult: many techniques had to be implemented in code to enable the games to work on multiple platforms. Recently browsers have been converging towards [[web standards]], which has made the design of DHTML games more viable. Those games can be played on all major browsers and they can also be ported to [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|Plasma]] for [[KDE]], Widgets for [[macOS]] and Gadgets for [[Windows Vista]], which are based on DHTML code.\n\nThe term \"DHTML\" has fallen out of use in recent years as it was associated with practices and conventions that tended to not work well between various web browsers. DHTML may now be referred to as [[unobtrusive JavaScript]] coding (DOM Scripting), in an effort to place an emphasis on agreed-upon best practices while [[Progressive Enhancement|allowing similar effects in an accessible, standards-compliant way]].\n\nDHTML support with extensive DOM access was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 4.0]]. Although there was a basic dynamic system with [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape Navigator 4.0]], not all HTML elements were represented in the DOM. When DHTML-style techniques became widespread, varying degrees of support among web browsers for the technologies involved made them difficult to develop and [[debug]]. Development became easier when [[Internet Explorer 5|Internet Explorer 5.0+]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] 2.0+, and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 7.0+ adopted a shared [[Document Object Model|DOM]] inherited from [[ECMAScript]].\n\nMore recently, [[JavaScript library|JavaScript libraries]] such as [[jQuery]] have abstracted away many of the day-to-day difficulties in cross-browser DOM manipulation.\n\n== Structure of a web page ==\n{{see also|DOM events}}\n\nTypically a web page using DHTML is set up in the following way:\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>DHTML example</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"navigation\"></div>\n\n        <script>\n            function init() {\n                var myObj = document.getElementById(\"navigation\");\n                // ... manipulate myObj\n            }\n            window.onload = init;\n        </script>\n\n        <!--\n        Often the code is stored in an external file; this is done\n        by linking the file that contains the JavaScript.\n        This is helpful when several pages use the same script:\n        -->\n        <script src=\"myjavascript.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n== Example: Displaying an additional block of text ==\n\nThe following code illustrates an often-used function. An additional part of a web page will only be displayed if the user requests it.\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Using a DOM function</title>\n        <style>\n            a { background-color: #eee; }\n            a:hover { background: #ff0; }\n            #toggleMe { background: #cfc; display: none; margin: 30px 0; padding: 1em; }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>Using a DOM function</h1>\n        \n        <h2><a id=\"showhide\" href=\"#\">Show paragraph</a></h2>\n        \n        <p id=\"toggleMe\">This is the paragraph that is only displayed on request.\n        \n        <p>The general flow of the document continues.\n        \n        <script>\n            function changeDisplayState(id) {\n                var d = document.getElementById('showhide'),\n                    e = document.getElementById(id);\n                if (e.style.display === 'none' || e.style.display === '') {\n                    e.style.display = 'block';\n                    d.innerHTML = 'Hide paragraph';\n                } else {\n                    e.style.display = 'none';\n                    d.innerHTML = 'Show paragraph';\n                }\n            }\n            document.getElementById('showhide').addEventListener('click', function (e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                changeDisplayState('toggleMe');\n            });\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n==Document Object Model==\n{{main|Document Object Model}}\nDHTML is not a technology in and of itself; rather, it  is the product of three related and complementary technologies: HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and [[JavaScript]]. To allow scripts and components to access features of HTML and CSS, the contents of the document are represented as objects in a programming model known as the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).\n\nThe DOM API is the foundation of DHTML, providing a structured interface that allows access and manipulation of virtually anything in the document. The HTML elements in the document are available as a hierarchical [[tree (data structure)|tree]] of individual objects, meaning you can examine and modify an element and its attributes by reading and setting properties and by calling methods. The text between elements is also available through DOM properties and methods.\n\nThe DOM also provides access to user actions such as pressing a key and clicking the mouse. You can intercept and process these and other events by creating event handler functions and routines. The event handler receives control each time a given event occurs and can carry out any appropriate action, including using the DOM to change the document.\n\n==Dynamic styles==\n\nDynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML. By using CSS, you can quickly change the appearance and formatting of elements in a document without adding or removing elements. This helps keep your documents small and the scripts that manipulate the document fast.\n\nThe object model provides programmatic access to styles. This means you can change inline styles on individual elements and change style rules using simple JavaScript programming.\n\nInline styles are CSS style assignments that have been applied to an element using the style attribute. You can examine and set these styles by retrieving the style object for an individual element. For example, to highlight the text in a heading when the user moves the mouse pointer over it, you can use the style object to enlarge the font and change its color, as shown in the following simple example.\n\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Dynamic Styles</title>\n        <style>\n            ul { display: none; }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1 id=\"firstHeader\">Welcome to Dynamic HTML</h1>\n\n        <p><a id=\"clickableLink\" href=\"#\">Dynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML.</a></p>\n\n        <ul id=\"unorderedList\">\n            <li>Change the color, size, and typeface of text</li>\n            <li>Show and hide text</li>\n            <li>And much, much more</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>We've only just begun!</p>\n\n        <script>\n            function showMe() {\n                document.getElementById(\"firstHeader\").style.color = \"#990000\";\n                document.getElementById(\"unorderedList\").style.display = \"block\";\n            }\n\n            document.getElementById(\"clickableLink\").addEventListener(\"click\", function (e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                showMe();\n            });\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dynamic web page]]\n*[[Dynamic Cascading Style Sheets]]\n*[[DHTMLEdit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project|project=wikibooks|text=JavaScript/DHTML}}\n* [http://www.quirksmode.org/ QuirksMode], a comprehensive site with test examples and instructions on how to write DHTML code which runs on several browsers.\n* [http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/dhtmlexplained.html Introductory DHTML Tutorial]\n* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533050.aspx HTML & DHTML Reference on MSDN]\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{ECMAScript}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:HTML]]", "sha1": "0vfz5zx0elkyfx1pq0kq24h2laeeheh"}}, {"title": "Distance education", "ns": "0", "id": "8997", "revision": {"id": "864171895", "parentid": "863558462", "timestamp": "2018-10-15T15:28:03Z", "contributor": {"ip": "117.230.17.126"}, "comment": "Added content", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n\n'''Distance education''' or '''long-distance learning''' is the education of students who may not always be physically present at a [[school]].<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008 |title=Higher education and the digital revolution: About MOOCs, SPOCs, social media, and the Cookie Monster |journal=Business Horizons |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=441\u201350 |year=2016 |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Honeyman |first=M |author2=Miller, G |date=December 1993 | title= Agriculture distance education: A valid alternative for higher education? | journal =Proceedings of the 20th Annual National Agricultural Education Research Meeting | pages= 67\u201373 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED366794.pdf#page=80 }}</ref> Traditionally, this usually involved '''correspondence courses''' wherein the student corresponded with the school via [[mail|post]].

There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.\n\n== Paced and self paced models ==\nDistance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronus mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers and institutions.\n\n[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously).<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\"/>\n\nPaced models are a familiar mode as they are used almost exclusively in campus based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models as teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.\n\nSelf-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy\t|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80\u201397 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon }}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.\n\n== Benefits ==\nDistance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series=|issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode=|oclc=|id=|url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format=|accessdate=23 January 2011 }}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name=\"Maggio, L.

With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to \"combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning\".<ref name=\"calpoly1\">{{cite journal |title=Educational Benefits of Online Learning|pages=1\u20136|year=1998|url=http://blackboardsupport.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/handouts/Ben_Online.pdf|publisher=CalPoly.edu |accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> It has been shown through research that \"as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people [they] construct an individual meaning\", which can help students become knowledgeable of a wide array of viewpoints in education.<ref name=\"calpoly1\" /> To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00308.x |title=Homophily of Network Ties and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital in Computer-Mediated Distributed Teams |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=1062\u201384 |year=2006 |last1=Yuan |first1=Y.

Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.<ref name=\"worldwidelearn2013\" />\n\nWithin the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide.

For those in a healthcare or mental health distance learning program, online-based interactions have the potential to foster deeper reflections and discussions of client issues<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> as well as a quicker response to client issues, since supervision happens on a regular basis and is not limited to a weekly supervision meeting.<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M.

[[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].\n\nThere may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M. A. 20012\" /> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.\n\nAdditionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that \"These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors\u2019 enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.\"<ref name=\"Hellman, Judith Adler 2003\">Hellman, Judith Adler. \"The Riddle of Distance Education.\" Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>\n\nA more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.<ref name=\"Nasiri et Mafakheri\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}</ref>\n\n== Educational technology ==\nThe modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT), replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence.

This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.

It was his [[debut novel|first novel]], published by [[Chatto & Windus]] in 1929,<ref>{{cite book|author=Aldington, Richard|title=Death of a Hero|year=2013|publisher=Penguin Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Death_of_a_Hero.html?id=efI7utxF9UcC|isbn=978-1-101-60293-5}}</ref> and thought to be partly [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n''Death of a Hero'' is the story of a young English artist named George Winterbourne who enlists in the army at the beginning of World War I. The book is narrated by an unnamed first-person narrator who claims to have known and served with the main character. It is divided into three parts.\n\n===Book I===\n\nThe first part details George's family history. His father, a middle-class man from England's countryside, marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family. After George's birth, his mother has a series of lovers.\n\nGeorge is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of English society. He is encouraged to learn his father's insurance business, but fails to do so. After a disagreement with his parents, he relocates to London to become an artist and live a socialite lifestyle.\n\n===Book II===\n\nThe second section of the book deals with George's London life. He ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies.\n\nAfter he and his lover, Elizabeth, have a pregnancy scare, they decide to marry. Although they do not have a child, the marriage endures. They decide to leave their marriage open. George takes Elizabeth's close friend as a lover, however, and their marriage begins to fall apart. Just as the situation is becoming particularly heated, England declares war on Germany. George decides to enlist.\n\n===Book III===\n\nGeorge trains for the army and is sent to France. (No particular location in France is mentioned. The town behind the front where George spends much of his time is referred to as M\u2014.) He fights on the front for some time. When he returns home, he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends, including his wife and lover.\n\nThe casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front. When a number of officers in George's unit are killed, he is promoted. Upon spending time with the other officers, he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian. He loses faith in the war quickly.\n\nThe story ends with George standing up during a machine-gun barrage. He is killed.\n\nAt the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing World War I to the Trojan War.\n\n==Censorship==\n\nAldington, a veteran of World War I, claimed that his novel was accurate in terms of speech and style. It contained extensive colloquial speech, including [[profanity]], discussion of sexuality and graphic descriptions of the war and of trench life. There was extensive censorship in England and many war novels had been banned or [[book burning|burned]] as a result. When Aldington first published his novel, he redacted a number of passages in order to ensure the publication of his book would not be challenged. He insisted that his publishers include a disclaimer in the original printing of the book with the following text:\n\n<blockquote>\nTo my astonishment, my publisher informed me that certain words, phrases, sentences, and even passages, are at present taboo in England. I have recorded nothing which I have not observed in human life, said nothing I do not believe to be true. [...] At my request the publishers are removing what they believe would be considered objectionable, and are placing asterisks to show where omissions have been made. [...] In my opinion it is better for the book to appear mutilated than for me to say what I don't believe.

The project describes itself as \"an organized [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] of the [[Earth|world]]\".\n\n==Requirements==\nThe precise location of each degree confluence uses the [[WGS 84]] horizontal datum, and visitors to degree confluences almost always make use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers. For a ''successful visit'', the visitor must get within 100 metres of the confluence point, and post a narrative and several photographs to the project website. A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an ''incomplete visit''. The project encourages visits to degree confluences which have been visited previously, and many confluence points - especially in non-remote regions of developed nations - have been visited several times.\n\nThe total number of degree confluences is 64,442,<ref>Latitude lines 89\u00b0N to 89\u00b0S (179), multiplied by 360\u00b0 of longitude (360), plus the two poles (2) = 179 &times; 360 + 2 = 64,442.</ref> of which 21,543 are on land, 38,409 on water, and 4,490 on the [[Antarctic]] and [[Arctic]] ice caps.<ref>[http://www.confluence.org/infoconf.php#location Classifications as of August 4, 2007]</ref> The project categorizes degree confluences as either ''primary'' or ''secondary''. A confluence is primary only if it is on land or within sight of land.

The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938.

[United Feature] told me they liked them both, and they'd like to see more samples, because I didn't bring much. I brought maybe six dailies of ''Barney's Beat'' and six dailies of ''Josie''. That posed a problem for me. I knew I couldn't handle both strips and still keep up with the comic book work, because a syndicated bit was very risky. So, I decided to shelve ''Josie'', and concentrated on ''Willie Lumpkin''. [When that strip ended after] a year, maybe a year and a half[,] I quickly submitted the Josie strip back to the publishers and Harold Anderson, and he sent it back and said, 'It's not what we're looking for, Dan, but keep up the good work,' or words of that kind. Then is when I decided to take it to Archie to see if they could do it as a comic book. I showed it to [[Richard Goldwater]], and he showed it to his father, and a day or two later I got the OK to do it as a comic book.<ref name=trades />}}\n[[File:Lapick inking decarlo archie.png|left|400px|thumb|Original art panels from \"The Reformer\" in ''[[Archie's Girls Betty and Veronica]]'' No. 157 (Jan. 1969), featuring (l. to r.)

The development of debit cards, unlike [[credit card]]s and [[charge card]]s, has generally been country specific resulting in a number of different systems around the world, which were often incompatible. Since the mid-2000s, a number of initiatives have allowed debit cards issued in one country to be used in other countries and allowed their use for internet and phone purchases.\n\nUnlike credit and charge cards, payments using a debit card are immediately transferred from the cardholder's designated bank account, instead of them paying the money back at a later date.\n\nDebit cards usually also allow for instant withdrawal of cash, acting as an [[ATM card]] for withdrawing cash.

The need for [[Single Euro Payments Area|cross-border compatibility]] and the advent of the [[euro]] recently led to many of these card networks (such as Switzerland's \"EC direkt,\" Austria's \"Bankomatkasse,\" and [[Switch (debit card)|Switch]] in the United Kingdom) being re-branded with the internationally recognized [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] logo, which is part of the MasterCard brand. Some debit cards are dual branded with the logo of the (former) national card as well as [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] (for example, EC cards in Germany, Switch and Solo in the UK, Pinpas cards in the Netherlands, Bancontact cards in Belgium, etc.). The use of a debit card system allows operators to package their product more effectively while monitoring customer spending.\n\n===Online debit system===\nOnline debit cards require electronic authorization of every transaction and the debits are reflected in the user\u2019s account immediately. The transaction may be additionally secured with the [[personal identification number]] (PIN) [[authentication]] system; some online cards require such authentication for every transaction, essentially becoming enhanced [[automatic teller machine]] [[ATM card|(ATM) cards]].\n\nOne difficulty with using online debit cards is the necessity of an electronic authorization device at the [[point of sale]] (POS) and sometimes also a separate [[PINpad]] to enter the PIN, although this is becoming commonplace for all card transactions in many countries.\n\nOverall, the online debit card is generally viewed as superior to the offline debit card because of its more secure authentication system and live status, which alleviates problems with processing [[lag]] on transactions that may only issue online debit cards. Some on-line debit systems are using the normal authentication processes of Internet banking to provide real-time online debit transactions.\n\n===Offline debit system===\nOffline debit cards have the [[logo]]s of major credit cards (for example, [[Visa Information System|Visa]]<ref name=\":0\" /> or [[MasterCard]]) or major debit cards (for example, [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, but not the United States) and are used at the [[point of sale]] like a credit card (with payer's signature). This type of debit card may be subject to a daily limit, and/or a maximum limit equal to the current/checking account balance from which it draws funds. Transactions conducted with offline debit cards require 2\u20133 days to be reflected on users\u2019 account balances.\n\nIn some countries and with some banks and merchant service organizations, a \"credit\" or offline debit transaction is without cost to the purchaser beyond the face value of the transaction, while a fee may be charged for a \"debit\" or online debit transaction (although it is often absorbed by the [[retailer]]). Other differences are that online debit purchasers may opt to withdraw cash in addition to the amount of the debit purchase (if the merchant supports that functionality); also, from the merchant's standpoint, the merchant pays lower fees on online debit transaction as compared to \"credit\" (offline).\n\n===Electronic purse card system===\n[[Smart card|Smart-card]]-based electronic purse systems (in which value is stored on the card chip, not in an externally recorded account, so that machines accepting the card need no network connectivity) are in use throughout Europe since the mid-1990s, most notably in Germany ([[Geldkarte]]), Austria ([[Quick Wertkarte]]), the Netherlands ([[Chipknip]]), Belgium ([[Proton (bank card)|Proton]]), Switzerland (CASH) and France ([[Moneo]], which is usually carried by a debit card). In Austria and Germany, almost all current bank cards now include electronic purses, whereas the electronic purse has been recently phased out in the Netherlands.\n\n===Prepaid debit cards===\n\n====Nomenclature====\nPrepaid debit cards that can be reloaded are also called reloadable debit cards.\n\n====Users====\n\nThe primary market for prepaid debit cards has traditionally been [[unbanked]] people;<ref>{{cite web|title=Pepper Prepaid Preport Extract|url=http://www.polymathconsulting.com/images/uploaded/Pepper%20Prepaid%20Report%20Extract.pdf|publisher=PEPPER|accessdate=2012-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130234425/http://www.polymathconsulting.com/images/uploaded/Pepper%20Prepaid%20Report%20Extract.pdf|archive-date=2012-01-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> that is, people who do not use banks or credit unions for their financial transactions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perine |first=Martha |url=http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/cb/articles/?id=2039 |title=Reaching the Unbanked and Underbanked |publisher=Stlouisfed.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>  But prepaid cards also appeal to other users attracted by their advantages.\n\n====Advantages====\n\nAdvantages of prepaid debit cards include being safer than carrying cash, worldwide functionality due to Visa and MasterCard merchant acceptance, not having to worry about paying a credit card bill or going into debt, the opportunity for anyone over the age of 18 to apply and be accepted without regard to credit quality, and the option to directly deposit paychecks and government benefits onto the card for free.<ref>{{cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/prepaid-debit-card-benefits-1271.php |title=Prepaid debit card benefits and disadvantages |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=2006-03-22 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>\n\n====Risks====\nIf the card provider offers an insecure website for letting you check the card's balance, this could give an attacker access to the card information.<ref>OneVanilla.com in your browser address bar might not show up as secure.</ref>\nIf you lose the card, and have not somehow registered it, you likely lose the money.

However, since 1999, there have been several new providers, such as TransCash, 247card, iKobo.

In 2008, the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] paired with [[Comerica Bank]] to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card.<ref>[http://bankcreditnews.com/news/federal-government-chooses-direct-deposit-and-prepaid-cards-over-mailing-checks/9413/ \u201cFederal government chooses direct deposit and prepaid cards over mailing checks\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423044908/http://bankcreditnews.com/news/federal-government-chooses-direct-deposit-and-prepaid-cards-over-mailing-checks/9413/ |date=2013-04-23 }}, BankCreditNews, 15 Apr 2013, Accessed 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the [[Association of Government Accountants]] released a report on government use of prepaid cards, concluding that such programs offer a number of advantages to governments and those who receive payments on a prepaid card rather than by check. The prepaid card programs benefit payments largely for cost savings they offer and provide easier access to cash for recipients, as well as increased security. The report also advises that governments should consider replacing any remaining [[cheque]]-based payments with prepaid card programs in order to realize substantial savings for taxpayers, as well as benefits for payees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bankcreditnews.com/news/aga-report-finds-government-prepaid-cards-offer-numerous-advantages/11472/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722053001/http://bankcreditnews.com/news/aga-report-finds-government-prepaid-cards-offer-numerous-advantages/11472/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 22, 2013 |title=AGA report finds government prepaid cards offer numerous advantages |date=July 12, 2013 |publisher=Bank Credit News |accessdate=2013-07-18 }}</ref>\n\n====Impact of Government-provided bank accounts====\nIn January 2016, the UK government introduced fee-free basic bank accounts for all, having a significant impact on the prepaid industry, including the departure of a number of firms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fee-Free Basic Bank Accounts Launched |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fee-free-bank-accounts-launched|accessdate=2016-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==Consumer protection==\nConsumer protections vary, depending on the network used. Visa and MasterCard, for instance, prohibit minimum and maximum purchase sizes, surcharges, and arbitrary security procedures on the part of merchants. Merchants are usually charged higher transaction fees for credit transactions, since debit network transactions are less likely to be fraudulent. This may lead them to \"steer\" customers to debit transactions. Consumers disputing charges may find it easier to do so with a credit card, since the money will not immediately leave their control. Fraudulent charges on a debit card can also cause problems with a [[checking account]] because the money is withdrawn immediately and may thus result in an overdraft or [[bounced check]]s. In some cases debit card-issuing banks will promptly refund any disputed charges until the matter can be settled, and in some jurisdictions the consumer liability for unauthorized charges is the same for both debit and credit cards.\n\nIn some countries, like India and Sweden, the consumer protection is the same regardless of the network used. Some banks set minimum and maximum purchase sizes, mostly for online-only cards. However, this has nothing to do with the card networks, but rather with the bank's judgement of the person's age and credit records. Any fees that the customers have to pay to the bank are the same regardless of whether the transaction is conducted as a credit or as a debit transaction, so there is no advantage for the customers to choose one transaction mode over another. Shops may add surcharges to the price of the goods or services in accordance with laws allowing them to do so. Banks consider the purchases as having been made at the moment when the card was swiped, regardless of when the purchase settlement was made. Regardless of which transaction type was used, the purchase may result in an overdraft because the money is considered to have left the account at the moment of the card swiping.\n\n==Financial access==\nDebit cards and [[secured credit card]]s are popular among college students who have not yet established a credit history. Debit cards may also be used by [[expatriate]]d workers to send money home to their families holding an affiliated debit card.\n\n==Issues with deferred posting of offline debit==\nTo the consumer, a debit transaction is perceived as occurring in real-time; ''i.e.'' the money is withdrawn from their account immediately following the authorization request from the merchant, which in many countries, is the case when making an online debit purchase. However, when a purchase is made using the \"credit\" (offline debit) option, the transaction merely places an [[authorization hold]] on the customer's account; funds are not actually withdrawn until the transaction is reconciled and hard-posted to the customer's account, usually a few days later. However, the previous sentence applies to all kinds of transaction types, at least when using a card issued by a European bank. This is in contrast to a typical credit card transaction; though it can also have a lag time of a few days before the transaction is posted to the account, it can be many days to a month or more before the consumer makes repayment with actual money.\n\nBecause of this, in the case of a benign or malicious error by the merchant or bank, a debit transaction may cause more serious problems (for example, money not accessible; overdrawn account) than in the case of a credit card transaction (for example, credit not accessible; over [[credit limit]]). This is especially true in the United States, where [[check fraud]] is a crime in every state, but exceeding your credit limit is not.\n\n==Internet purchases==\nDebit cards may also be used on the Internet either with or without using a PIN. Internet transactions may be conducted in either online or offline mode, although shops accepting online-only cards are rare in some countries (such as Sweden), while they are common in other countries (such as the Netherlands). For a comparison, [[PayPal]] offers the customer to use an online-only Maestro card if the customer enters a Dutch address of residence, but not if the same customer enters a Swedish address of residence.\n\nInternet purchases can be authenticated by the consumer entering their PIN if the merchant has enabled a secure online PIN pad, in which case the transaction is conducted in debit mode. Otherwise, transactions may be conducted in either credit or debit mode (which is sometimes, but not always, indicated on the receipt), and this has nothing to do with whether the transaction was conducted in online or offline mode, since both credit and debit transactions may be conducted in both modes.\n\n==Debit cards around the world==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nIn some countries, banks tend to levy a small fee for each debit card transaction. In some countries (for example, the UK) the merchants bear all the costs and customers are not charged. There are many people who routinely use debit cards for all transactions, no matter how small. Some (small) retailers refuse to accept debit cards for small transactions, where paying the transaction fee would absorb the [[profit margin]] on the sale, making the transaction uneconomic for the retailer.\n\n===Angola===\n{{Main|Multicaixa}}\nThe banks in Angola issue by official regulation only one brand of debit cards: [[Multicaixa]], which is also the brand name of the one and only network of ATMs and POS terminals.\n\n===Armenia===\nArCa (Armenian Card) - a national system of debit (ArCa Debit and ArCa Classic) and credit (ArCa Gold, ArCa Business, ArCA Platinum, ArCa Affinity and ArCa Co-branded) cards popular in the Republic of Armenia. Established in 2000 by 17 largest Armenian banks.\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|EFTPOS}}\nDebit cards in [[Australia]] are called different names depending on the issuing bank: [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]: Keycard; [[Westpac|Westpac Banking Corporation]]: Handycard; [[National Australia Bank]]: FlexiCard; [[ANZ Bank]]: Access card; [[Bendigo Bank]]: Cashcard.\n\nEFTPOS is very popular in Australia and has been operating there since the 1980s. EFTPOS-enabled cards are accepted at almost all swipe terminals able to accept [[credit card]]s, regardless of the bank that issued the card, including [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] cards issued by foreign banks, with most businesses accepting them, with 450,000 point of sale terminals.<ref>http://www.maestrocard.com/cgi-bin/wheretouse.cgi?country=002&Select+a+country.x=14&Select+a+country.y=2&region=01</ref>\n\nEFTPOS cards can also be used to deposit and withdraw cash over the counter at [[Australia Post]] outlets participating in GiroPost, just as if the transaction was conducted at a bank branch, even if the bank branch is closed. Electronic transactions in Australia are generally processed via the [[Telstra Argent]] and [[Optus Transact Plus]] network - which has recently superseded the old [[Telstra Transcend|Transcend]] network in the last few years. Most early keycards were only usable for EFTPOS and at ATM or bank branches, whilst the new debit card system works in the same way as a credit card, except it will only use funds in the specified bank account. This means that, among other advantages, the new system is suitable for electronic purchases without a delay of two to four days for bank-to-bank money transfers.\n\nAustralia operates both electronic credit card transaction authorization and traditional EFTPOS debit card authorization systems, the difference between the two being that EFTPOS transactions are authorized by a personal identification number (PIN) while credit card transactions can additionally be authorized using a [[contactless payment]] mechanism. If the user fails to enter the correct pin three times, the consequences range from the card being locked out for a minimum 24-hour period, a phone call or trip to the branch to reactivate with a new PIN, the card being cut up by the merchant, or in the case of an ATM, being kept inside the machine, both of which require a new card to be ordered.\n\nGenerally credit card transaction costs are borne by the merchant with no fee applied to the end user (although a direct consumer surcharge of 0.5 - 3% is not uncommon) while EFTPOS transactions cost the consumer an applicable withdrawal fee charged by their bank.\n\nThe introduction of Visa and MasterCard debit cards along with regulation in the settlement fees charged by the operators of both EFTPOS and credit cards by the Reserve Bank has seen a continuation in the increasing ubiquity of credit card use among Australians and a general decline in the profile of EFTPOS. However, the regulation of settlement fees also removed the ability of banks, who typically provide merchant services to retailers on behalf of Visa or MasterCard, from stopping those retailers charging extra fees to take payment by credit card instead of cash or EFTPOS.\n\n===Bahrain===\nIn Bahrain debit cards are under [[The Benefit Company|Benefit]], the interbanking network for Bahrain. Benefit is also accepted in other countries though, mainly GCC, similar to the [[Saudi Payments Network]] and the Kuwaiti [[KNET (interbank network)|KNET]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nIn Brazil debit cards are called ''cart\u00e3o de d\u00e9bito'' (singular) and got popular from 2008 and on. In 2013, the 100 millionth Brazilian debit card was issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/seu-dinheiro/noticia/2014/05/cartoes-de-debito-superam-barreira-dos-100-milhoes-em-2013-diz-bc.html|title=Cart\u00f5es de d\u00e9bito superam barreira dos 100 milh\u00f5es em 2013, diz BC|date=12 May 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Debit cards replaced [[cheque]]s, common until the first decade of the 2000s.\n\nToday, the majority of the financial transactions (like shopping, etc.) are made using debit cards (and this system is quickly replacing cash payments). Nowadays, the majority of debit payments are processed using a card + pin combination, and almost every card comes with a chip to make transactions.\n\nThe major debit card vendors in Brazil are Visa (with Visa Electron cards) and MasterCard (with Maestro cards), as well as local brand Elo.\n\n=== Benin ===\n\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nIn Bulgaria, debit cards are accepted in almost all stores and shops, as well as in most of the hotels and restaurants in the bigger cities. Smaller restaurants or small shops often accept cash only. All Bulgarian banks can provide debit cards when you open a bank account, for maintenance costs. Usually, it is free to use debit cards on ATMs owned by the issuing bank are free of charge, and they can also be used on the ATMs of other banks for a small fee (3-10 times cheaper than using a credit card). The most common cards in Bulgaria are Maestro and Visa Electron, accepted everywhere together with Visa and MasterCard.\n\n=== Burkina Faso ===\n\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Interac}}\n[[Canada]] has a nationwide EFTPOS system, called [[Interac|Interac Direct Payment]] (IDP). Since being introduced in 1994, IDP has become the most popular payment method in the country. Previously, debit cards have been in use for [[Automated bank machine|ABM]] usage since the late 1970s, with [[credit union]]s in Saskatchewan and Alberta introducing the first card-based, networked ATMs beginning in June 1977. Debit cards, which could be used anywhere a credit card was accepted, were first introduced in Canada by Saskatchewan Credit Unions in 1982.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/automated_teller_machines.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan &#124; Details|first=|date=2012-03-26|website=|publisher=Esask.uregina.ca|author=Cory Toth - Encyclopedia Of Saskatchewan|accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> In the early 1990s, pilot projects were conducted among Canada's six largest banks to gauge security, accuracy and feasibility of the Interac system. Slowly in the later half of the 1990s, it was estimated that approximately 50% of retailers offered Interac as a source of payment. Retailers, many small transaction retailers like coffee shops, resisted offering IDP to promote faster service. In 2009, 99% of retailers offer IDP as an alternative payment form.\n\nIn Canada, the debit card is sometimes referred to as a \"bank card\". It is a client card issued by a bank that provides access to funds and other bank account transactions, such as transferring funds, checking balances, paying bills, etc., as well as point of purchase transactions connected on the [[Interac]] network. Since its national launch in 1994, Interac Direct Payment has become so widespread that, as of 2001, more transactions in Canada were completed using debit cards than cash.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/oca-bc.nsf/eng/ca02096.html |title=Consumers and Changing Retail Markets | publisher= Canada\u2019s Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA)}}</ref> This popularity may be partially attributable to two main factors: the convenience of not having to carry cash, and the availability of automated bank machines (ABMs) and direct payment merchants on the network.\n\nDebit cards may be considered similar to [[stored-value card]]s in that they represent a finite amount of money owed by the card issuer to the holder. They are different in that stored-value cards are generally anonymous and are only usable at the issuer, while debit cards are generally associated with an individual's bank account and can be used anywhere on the [[Interac]] network.\n\nIn Canada, the bank cards can be used at POS and ABMs. Interac Online has also been introduced in recent years allowing clients of most major Canadian banks to use their debit cards for online payment with certain merchants as well. Certain financial institutions also allow their clients to use their debit cards in the United States on the NYCE network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyce.net/consumers/canadian/canadian_banks/index.htm |title=NYCE - Participating Canadian Financial Institutions |publisher=NYCE Payment network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705232030/http://www.nyce.net/consumers/canadian/canadian_banks/index.htm |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Consumer protection in Canada====\nConsumers in Canada are protected under a voluntary code entered into by all providers of debit card services, The Canadian Code of Practice for Consumer Debit Card Services<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/industry/RefDocs/default.asp#dcc |title=FCAC - For the Industry - Reference Documents |publisher=Fcac-acfc.gc.ca |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> (sometimes called the \"Debit Card Code\"). Adherence to the Code is overseen by the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]] (FCAC), which investigates consumer complaints.\n\nAccording to the FCAC website, revisions to the code that came into effect in 2005 put the onus on the financial institution to prove that a consumer was responsible for a disputed transaction, and also place a limit on the number of days that an account can be frozen during the financial institution's investigation of a transaction.\n\n===Chile===\n[[Chile]] has an EFTPOS system called ''Redcompra'' (Purchase Network) which is currently used in at least 23,000 establishments throughout the country. Goods may be purchased using this system at most supermarkets, retail stores, pubs and restaurants in major urban centers. Chilean banks issue Maestro, Visa Electron and Visa Debit cards.\n\n=== Colombia ===\n[[Colombia]] has a system called Redeban-Multicolor and Credibanco Visa which are currently used in at least 23,000 establishments throughout the country. Goods may be purchased using this system at most supermarkets, retail stores, pubs and restaurants in major urban centers. Colombian debit cards are Maestro (pin), Visa Electron (pin), Visa Debit (as credit) and MasterCard-Debit (as credit).\n\n=== C\u00f4te d'Ivoire ===\n\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\n===Denmark===\nThe Danish debit card [[Dankort]] is ubiquitous in [[Denmark]]. It was introduced on 1 September 1983, and despite the initial transactions being paper-based, the Dankort quickly won widespread acceptance. By 1985 the first [[EFTPOS terminal]]s were introduced, and 1985 was also the year when the number of Dankort transactions first exceeded 1&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"dankort25th\">{{cite web|author=Af Jesper Stein Sandal Mandag, 1. september 2008 - 7:09 |url=http://www.version2.dk/artikel/8297 |title=Dankortet fylder 25 \u00e5r i dag |language=da |publisher=Version2.dk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> Today Dankort is primarily issued as a multicard combining the national Dankort with the more internationally recognized Visa (denoted simply as a \"Visa/Dankort\" card).

Checks are no longer used. Prior to European standardization, Finland had a national standard (''pankkikortti''). Physically, a ''pankkikortti'' was the same as an international credit card, and the same card imprinters and slips were used for ''pankkikortti'' and credit cards, but the cards were not accepted abroad. This has now been replaced by the Visa and MasterCard debit card systems, and Finnish cards can be used elsewhere in the European Union and the world.\n\nAn electronic purse system, with a chipped card, was introduced, but did not gain much traction.\n\nSigning a payment offline entails incurring debt, thus offline payment is not available to minors. However, online transactions are permitted, and since almost all stores have electronic terminals, today also minors can use debit cards. Previously, only cash withdrawal from ATMs was available to minors (''automaattikortti'' or Visa).\n\n===France===\nCarte Bancaire (CB), the national payment scheme, in 2008, had 57.5&nbsp;million cards carrying its logo and 7.76&nbsp;billion transactions (POS and ATM) were processed through the e-rsb network (135 transactions per card mostly debit or deferred debit). Most CB cards are debit cards, either debit or deferred debit. Less than 10% of CB cards were credit cards.\n\nBanks in France usually charge annual fees for debit cards (despite card payments being very cost efficient for the banks), yet they do not charge personal customers for checkbooks or processing checks (despite checks being very costly for the banks). This imbalance dates from the unilateral introduction in France of [[Chip and PIN]] debit cards in the early 1990s, when the cost of this technology was much higher than it is now. Credit cards of the type found in the United Kingdom and United States are unusual in France and the closest equivalent is the deferred debit card, which operates like a normal debit card, except that all purchase transactions are postponed until the end of the month, thereby giving the customer between 1 and 31 days of \"interest-free\"<ref>There is no interest applied ''per se'' but the extra cost for a deferred debit card is around 10\u20ac a year.</ref> credit.\n\nThe annual fee for a deferred debit card is around \u20ac10 more than for one with immediate debit. Most France debit cards are branded with the [[Carte Bleue]] logo, which assures acceptance throughout France. Most card holders choose to pay around \u20ac5 more in their annual fee to additionally have a Visa or a [[MasterCard (credit card)|MasterCard]] logo on their Carte Bleue, so that the card is accepted internationally. A Carte Bleue without a Visa or a MasterCard logo is often known as a \"Carte Bleue Nationale\" and a Carte Bleue with a Visa or a MasterCard logo is known as a \"Carte Bleue Internationale\", or more frequently, simply called a \"Visa\" or \"MasterCard\".\n\nMany smaller merchants in France refuse to accept debit cards for transactions under a certain amount because of the minimum fee charged by merchants' banks per transaction (this minimum amount varies from \u20ac5 to \u20ac15.25, or in some rare cases even more). But more and more merchants accept debit cards for small amounts, due to the massive daily use of debit card nowadays. Merchants in France do not differentiate between debit and credit cards, and so both have equal acceptance. It is legal in France to set a minimum amount to transactions, but the merchants must display it clearly.\n\nIn January 2016, 57.2% of all the debits cards in France also had a [[contactless payment]] chip .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartes-bancaires.com/spip.php?article274 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307174424/http://www.cartes-bancaires.com/spip.php?article274 |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}</ref> The maximum amount per transaction is set to \u20ac20 and the maximum amount of all contactless payments per day is between 50 and \u20ac100 depending on the bank.\n\n==== Liability and e-cards ====\nAccording to French law,<ref>https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F31241 in French.</ref> banks are liable for any transaction made with a copy of the original card and for any transaction made without a card (on the phone or on the Internet), so banks have to pay back any fraudulent transaction to the card holder if the previous criteria are met. Fighting card fraud is therefore more interesting for banks. As a consequence, French banks websites usually propose an \"e-card\" service (\"electronic (bank) card\"), where a new [[virtual Card|virtual card]] is created and linked to a physical card. Such virtual card can be used only once and for the maximum amount given by the card holder. If the virtual card number is intercepted or used to try to get a higher amount than expected, the transaction is blocked.\n\n===Germany===\nDebit cards have enjoyed wide acceptance in [[Germany]] for years.{{Citation needed|reason=How wide? When?|date=January 2018}} Facilities already existed before EFTPOS became popular with the [[Eurocheque]] card, an authorization system initially developed for paper [[Cheque|checks]] where, in addition to signing the actual check, customers also needed to show the card alongside the check as a security measure. Those cards could also be used at ATMs and for card-based [[electronic funds transfer]] (called [[Girocard]]) with PIN entry. These are now the only functions of such cards: the Eurocheque system (along with the brand) was abandoned in 2002 during the transition from the [[Deutsche Mark]] to the [[euro]]. As of 2005, most stores and petrol outlets have EFTPOS facilities. Processing fees are paid by the businesses, which leads to some business owners refusing debit card payments for sales totalling less than a certain amount, usually 5 or 10 euro.\n\nTo avoid the processing fees, many businesses resorted to using [[direct debit]], which is then called ''electronic'' direct debit ({{lang-de|Elektronisches [[:de:Lastschriftverfahren|Lastschriftverfahren]]}}, abbr. ''ELV''). The point-of-sale terminal reads the bank sort code and account number from the card but instead of handling the transaction through the Girocard network it simply prints a form, which the customer signs to authorise the debit note. However, this method also avoids any verification or payment guarantee provided by the network. Further, customers can return debit notes by notifying their bank without giving a reason. This means that the beneficiary bears the risk of fraud and illiquidity. Some business mitigate the risk by consulting a proprietary [[blacklist]] or by switching to Girocard for higher transaction amounts.\n\nAround 2000, an Electronic Purse Card was introduced, dubbed [[Geldkarte]] (\"money card\"). It makes use of the [[smart card]] chip on the front of the standard issue debit card. This chip can be charged with up to 200 euro, and is advertised as a means of making medium to very small payments, even down to several euros or cent payments. The key factor here is that no processing fees are deducted by banks. It did not gain the popularity its inventors had hoped for. However, this could change as this chip is now used as means of age verification at cigarette vending machines, which has been mandatory since January 2007. Furthermore, some payment discounts are being offered (''e.g.'' a 10% reduction for public transport fares) when paying with \"Geldkarte\". The \"Geldkarte\" payment lacks all security measures, since it does not require the user to enter a PIN or sign a sales slip: the loss of a \"Geldkarte\" is similar to the loss of a wallet or purse - anyone who finds it can then use their find to pay for their own purchases.\n\n'''<big>Guin\u00e9e Bissau</big>'''\n\nPlease, see below on \"UEMOA\"\n\n===Greece===\n\nDebit card usage surged in Greece after the introduction of [[Capital controls in Greece|Capital Controls]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11782977/Greeks-lose-their-love-of-cash-as-crisis-spurs-surge-in-debit-cards.html|title=Greeks lose their love of cash as crisis spurs surge in debit cards|first=|last=Bloomberg|date=4 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0411/Why-Greeks-swap-of-cash-for-cards-could-end-a-culture-of-tax-evasion|title=Why Greeks' swap of cash for cards could end a culture of tax evasion|date=11 April 2016|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>\n\n===Hong Kong===\nMost bank cards in Hong Kong for saving / current accounts are equipped with [[Electronic Payment Services|EPS]] and [[UnionPay]], which function as a debit card and can be used at merchants for purchases, where funds are withdrawn from the associated account immediately.\n\n[[Electronic Payment Services|EPS]] is a Hong Kong only system and is widely accepted in merchants and government departments. However, as [[UnionPay]] cards are accepted more widely overseas, consumers can use the [[UnionPay]] functionality of the bank card to make purchases directly from the bank account.\n\nVisa debit cards are uncommon in Hong Kong. The British banking firm [[HSBC]]'s subsidiary [[Hang Seng Bank]]'s Enjoy card and American firm [[Citibank]]'s ATM Visa are two of the Visa debit cards available in Hong Kong.\n\nDebit cards usage in Hong Kong is relatively low, as the [[credit card]] penetration rate is high in Hong Kong. In Q1 2017, there are near 20 million credit cards in circulation, about 3 times the adult population. There are 145800 thousand transaction made by credit cards but only 34001 thousand transactions made by debit cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2017/20170623e4a1.pdf|title=Statistics of Payment Cards Issued in Hong Kong for First Quarter 2017, Hong Kong Monetary Authority|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Hungary===\nIn [[Hungary]] debit cards are far more common and popular than credit cards.

Domestically-owned debit card networks operating in Indonesia include [[Bank Central Asia|Debit BCA]] (and its [[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima]] network's counterpart, Prima Debit) and [[Bank Mandiri|Mandiri Debit]].\n\n===Iraq===\nIraq's two biggest state-owned banks, [[Rafidain Bank]] and [[Rasheed Bank]], together with the ''Iraqi Electronic Payment System (IEPS)'' have established a company called International Smart Card, which has developed a national credit card called '[[Qi Card]]', which they have issued since 2008. According to the company's website: 'after less than two years of the initial launch of the Qi card solution, we have hit 1.6&nbsp;million cardholder with the potential to issue 2&nbsp;million cards by the end of 2010, issuing about 100,000 card monthly is a testament to the huge success of the Qi card solution. Parallel to this will be the expansion into retail stores through a network of points of sales of about 30,000 units by 2015'\n\n===Ireland===\n\nToday, Irish debit cards are exclusively Chip and PIN and almost entirely Visa Debit. These can be used anywhere the Visa logo is seen and in much the same way as a credit card. MasterCard debit is also used by a small minority of institutions and operates in a very similar manner.\n\nIrish debit cards are normally multi-functional and combine ATM card facilities. The cards are also sometimes used for authenticating transactions together with a card reader for 2-factor authentication on online banking.\n\nThe majority of Irish Visa Debit cards are also enabled for contactless payment for small, frequent transactions (with a maximum value of \u20ac15 or \u20ac30). Three consecutive contactless transactions are allowed, after which, the card software will refuse contactless transactions until a standard Chip and PIN transaction has been completed and the counter resets. This measure was put in place to minimise issuers' exposure to fraudulent charges.\n\nThe cards are usually processed online, but some cards can also be processed offline depending on the rules applied by the card issuer.\n\nA number of card issuers also provide prepaid debit card accounts primarily for use as gift cards / vouchers or for added security and anonymity online. These may be disposable or reloadable and are usually either Visa or MasterCard branded.\n\nPrevious system (defunct since 28 February 2014):\n\n[[Laser (debit card)|Laser]] was launched by the Irish banks in 1996 as an extension of the existing ATM and [[Cheque guarantee card]] systems that had existed for many years. When the service was added, it became possible to make payments with a multifunctional card that combined ATM, cheque and debit card and international ATM facilities through MasterCard Cirrus or Visa Plus and sometimes the British Link ATM system. Their functionality was similar to the British [[Switch (debit card)|Switch]] card.\n\nThe system first launched as a swipe & sign card and could be used in Ireland in much the same way as a credit card and were compatible standard card terminals (online or offline, although they were usually processed online). They could also be used in cardholder-not-present transactions over the phone, by mail or on the internet or for processing recurring payments. Laser also offered 'cash back' facilities where customers could ask retailers (where offered) for an amount of cash along with their transaction. This service allowed retailers to reduce volumes of cash in tills and allowed consumers to avoid having to use ATMs. Laser adopted EMV 'Chip and PIN' security in 2002 in common with other credit and debit cards right across Europe. In 2005, some banks issued customers with Lasers cards that were cobranded with Maestro. This allowed them to be used in POS terminals overseas, internet transactions were usually restricted to sites that specifically accepted Laser.\n\nSince 2006, Irish banks have progressively replaced Laser with international schemes, primarily Visa Debit and by 28 February 2014 the Laser Card system had been withdrawn entirely and is no longer accepted by retailers.\n\n===Israel===\nThe Israel bank card system is somewhat confusing to newcomers, comprising a blend of features taken from different types of cards. What may be referred to as a credit card, is most likely to be a deferred debit card on an associated bank current account, the most common type of card in Israel, somewhat like the situation in France, though the term \"debit card\" is not in common usage. Cards are nearly universally called ''cartis ashrai'' (\u05db\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9), literally, \"credit card\", a term which may bely the card's characteristics. Its main feature may be a direct link to a connected bank account (through which they are mostly issued), with the total value of the transactions made on the card being debited from the bank account in full on a regular date once a month, without the option to carry the balance over; indeed certain types of transactions (such as online and/or foreign currency) may be debited directly from the connected bank account at the time of the transaction. Any such limited credit enjoyed is a result of the customer's assets and credibility with the bank, and not granted by the credit card company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Szajnbrum |first=Tzvi |title=Credit Cards and Lines of Credit |url=http://lawadv.com/credit-cards-and-lines-of-credit/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131113174410/http://lawadv.com/credit-cards-and-lines-of-credit/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2013-11-13 }}</ref> The card usually enables immediate ATM cash withdrawals & balance inquiries (as debit cards do), instalment & deferred charge interest free transactions offered by merchants (also applicable in Brazil), interest bearing instalment plans/deferred charge/revolving credit which is transaction specific at the point of sale (though granted by the issuer, hence the interest), and a variety of automated/upon request types of credit schemes including loans, some of which revolve or resemble the extended payment options sometimes offered by charge cards.\n\nThus the \"true\" debit card is not so common in Israel, though it has existed since 1994. It is offered by two credit companies in Israel: One is ICC, short for \"Israeli Credit Cards\" (referred to as \"CAL\", an acronym formed from its abbreviation in Hebrew), which issues it in the form of a Visa Electron card valid only in Israel. It is offered mainly through the Israel Post (post office) bank<ref name=\"israelpost\">{{cite web |url=http://www.israelpost.co.il/postshirut.nsf/misparide/140?opendocument&L=EN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309061344/http://www.israelpost.co.il/postshirut.nsf/misparide/140?opendocument&L=EN |archivedate=2010-03-09 |dead-url=yes |title=Visa CAL Debit Card - Israel Postal Company |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=2015-12-01 |df= }}</ref> (which is not allowed, by regulation, to offer any type of credit) or through [[Israel Discount Bank]], its main owner (where it is branded as \"Discount Money Key\" card). This branded Israel Discount Bank branded debit card also offered as valid worldwide card, either as Visa Electron or MasterCard Debit cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discountbank.co.il/wps/wcm/connect/75378f004263537dbf0cff4b2936df85/tarifon_private_chapter_D.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&lmod=898880976&CACHEID=75378f004263537dbf0cff4b2936df85|title=\u05e4\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd - \u05d1\u05e0\u05e7 \u05d3\u05d9\u05e1\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d8|work=discountbank.co.il}}</ref> The second & more common debit card is offered by the [[Isracard]] consortium to its affiliate banks and is branded \"Direct\". It is valid only in Israel, under its local & unique - though immensely popular - private label brand, as \"Isracard Direct\" (which was known as \"Electro Cheque\" until 2002 and while the local brand Isracard is often viewed as a MasterCard for local use only). Since 2006, Isracard has also offered an international version, branded \"MasterCard Direct\", which is less common. These two debit card brands operate offline in Israel (meaning the transaction operates under the credit cards systems & debited officially from the cardholder account only few days later, after being processed - though reflected on the current account immediately). In 2014 the Isracard Direct card (a.k.a. the valid only in Israel version) was relaunched as Isracash,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.isracard.co.il/isracash|title=isracash|work=isracard.co.il}}</ref> though the former subbrand still being marketed - & replaced ICC Visa Electron as Israel Post bank debit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelpost.co.il/content.nsf/pages/isracard_direct|title=\u05db\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05e1 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05db\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d3\u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05d8  - \u05d3\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc|work=israelpost.co.il}}</ref>\n\nOverall, banks routinely offer deferred debit cards to their new customers, with \"true\" debit cards usually offered only to those who cannot obtain credit. These latter cards are not attractive to the average customer since they attract both a monthly fee from the credit company and a bank account fee for each day's debits. Isracard Direct is by far more common than the ICC Visa Electron debit card. Banks who issue mainly Visa cards will rather offer electronic use, mandate authorized transaction only, unembossed version of Visa Electron deferred debit cards (branded as \"Visa Basic\" or \"Visa Classic\") to its customers - sometimes even in the form of revolving credit card.\n\nCredit/debit card transactions in Israel are not PIN based (other than at ATMs) and it is only in recent years that [[EMV]] chip smart cards have begun to be issued, with the Bank of Israel ordering the banks and credit card companies - in 2013 - to switch customers to credit cards with the EMV security standard within 3.5 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Avissar |first=Irit |title=BoI requires switch to smart credit cards |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000873790 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |newspaper=Globes |date=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113184415/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000873790 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nDebit cards are quite popular in Italy. There are both classic and prepaid cards. The main classic debit card in Italy is [[Bancomat (debit card)|Bancomat/PagoBancomat]]: this kind of card is issued by Italian banks. Bancomat is the commercial brand for the cash withdrawal circuit, while PagoBancomat is used for POS transactions. Unlike other European countries such as UK, only a few Italian banks are issuing Visa/MasterCard debit cards (such as [[Intesa Sanpaolo]] NextCard). The main international debit circuit used by Italian banks is Mastercard's Maestro: for this reason almost every debit card issued in Italy has both PagoBancomat and Maestro logos, with Bancomat/PagoBancomat being used in Italy and the Maestro circuit when abroad. Sometimes, instead of using the Maestro circuit, the Bancomat/PagoBancomat debit card is issued along with V-Pay or Visa Electron logos, or sometimes with credit card functions (so you get a dual-mode card). In this last case, only the credit-card mode is allowed for abroad/Internet transactions, while the debit card mode is used only in Italy. The most popular prepaid debit card is \"Postepay\". It is issued by [[Poste italiane|Poste italiane S.p.A.]], and usually runs on the Visa Electron circuit, but there are some versions that run on MasterCard. It can be used on Poste Italiane's ATMs (Postamat) and on Visa's Electron-compatible bank ATMs all over the world. It has no fees when used on the Internet and in POS-based transactions. Other cards are issued by other companies, such as Vodafone CashCard, Banca Popolare di Milano's Carta Jeans and Carta Moneta Online.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Update|section|date=June 2011}}\nIn [[Japan]] people usually use their {{Nihongo|''cash cards''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|kyasshu k\u0101do}}, originally intended only for use with cash machines, as debit cards. The debit functionality of these cards is usually referred to as {{Nihongo|''J-Debit''|\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30c7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8|Jeidebitto}}, and only cash cards from certain banks can be used. A cash card has the same size as a Visa/MasterCard. As identification, the user will have to enter his or her four-digit PIN when paying. J-Debit was started in Japan on March 6, 2000. However, J-Debit has not been that popular since then.\n\n[[Suruga Bank]] began service of Japan's first [[Visa Debit]] in 2006. Rakuten Bank, formally known as Ebank, offers a Visa debit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rakuten-bank.co.jp/card/debit/index.html |title=\u697d\u5929\u9280\u884c\u30c7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\uff5c\u697d\u5929\u9280\u884c |publisher=Rakuten-bank.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>\n\nResona Bank and [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]] bank also offer a Visa branded debit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resona-gr.co.jp/resonabank/kojin/service/hiraku/visa_debit/index.html |title=\u308a\u305d\u306aVisa\u30c7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u2502\u4fbf\u5229\u306b\u304a\u5f97\u306b\u4f7f\u3044\u305f\u3044\u2502\u308a\u305d\u306a\u9280\u884c |publisher=Resona-gr.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bk.mufg.jp/tsukau/visadebit/index.html?link_id=p_kojin_tsukau_visadebit |title=\u4e09\u83f1\u6771\u4eacUFJ-VISA\u30c7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8 \u2502\u4e09\u83f1\u6771\u4eacUFJ\u9280\u884c |publisher=bk.mufg.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>\n\n===Kuwait===\nIn Kuwait, all banks provide a debit card to their account holders. This card is branded as KNET, which is the central switch in Kuwait. KNET card transactions are free for both customer and the merchant and therefore KNET debit cards are used for low valued transactions as well. KNET cards are mostly co-branded as Maestro or Visa Electron which makes it possible to use the same card outside Kuwait on any terminal supporting these payment schemes.\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn Malaysia, the local debit card network is operated by the Malaysian Electronic Clearing Corporation (MyClear), which had taken over the scheme from MEPS in 2008. The new name for the local debit card in Malaysia is MyDebit, which was previously known as either bankcard or e-debit. Debit cards in Malaysia are now issued on a combo basis where the card has both the local debit card payment application as well as having that of an International scheme (Visa or MasterCard). All newly issued MyDebit combo cards with Visa or MasterCard have the contactless payment feature. The same card also acts as the ATM card for cash withdrawals.\n\n'''<big>Mali</big>'''\n\nPlease, see below on \"UEMOA\"\n\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, many companies use a type of debit card called a payroll card (tarjeta de n\u00f3mina), in which they deposit their employee's payrolls, instead of paying them in cash or through checks. This method is preferred in many places because it is a much safer and secure alternative compared to the more traditional forms of payment.\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] using [[EFTPOS]] is known as ''pinnen'' (pinning), a term derived from the use of a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). PINs are also used for [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] transactions, and the term is used interchangeably by many people, although it was introduced as a marketing brand for EFTPOS. The system was launched in 1987, and in 2010 there were 258,585 terminals throughout the country, including mobile terminals used by delivery services and on markets. All banks offer a debit card suitable for EFTPOS with current accounts.\n\nPIN transactions are usually free to the customer, but the retailer is charged per-transaction and monthly fees. [[Equens]], an association with all major banks as its members, runs the system, and until August 2005 also charged for it. Responding to allegations of monopoly abuse, it has handed over contractual responsibilities to its member banks through who now offer competing contracts. The system is organised through a special banking association [[Currence]] set up specifically to coordinate access to payment systems in the Netherlands. Interpay, a legal predecessor of Equens, was fined \u20ac47&nbsp;million in 2004, but the fine was later dropped, and a related fine for banks was lowered from \u20ac17&nbsp;million to \u20ac14&nbsp;million. Per-transaction fees are between 5-10 eurocents, depending on volume.\n\nCredit card use in the Netherlands is very low, and most credit cards cannot be used with EFTPOS, or charge very high fees to the customer. Debit cards can often, though not always, be used in the entire EU for EFTPOS. Most debit cards are Mastercard [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] cards. Visa's [[V Pay]] cards are also accepted at most locations.\nIn 2011 spending money using debit cards rose to 83&nbsp;billion euro whilst cash spending dropped to 51&nbsp;billion euro and creditcard spending grew to 5&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnb.nl/en/news/news-and-archive/dnbulletin-2012/dnb274102.jsp |title=DNBulletin: Cash payments further down - De Nederlandsche Bank |publisher=Dnb.nl |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>\n\nElectronic Purse Cards (called [[Chipknip]]) were introduced in 1996, but have never become very popular. The system was abolished at the end of 2014.\n\n===New Zealand===\nEFTPOS ([[electronic fund transfer]] at [[point of sale]]) in New Zealand is highly popular. In 2006, 70 percent of all retail transactions were made by Eftpos, with an average of 306 Eftpos transaction being made per person. At the same time, there were 125,000 Eftpos terminals in operation (one for every 30 people), and 5.1&nbsp;million Eftpos cards in circulation (1.27 per capita).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/markets_and_payment_operations/ |title= Payment and Settlement Systems in New Zealand |work= Reserve Bank of New Zealand |date = March 2008|accessdate= 2010-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe system involves the merchant swiping (or inserting) the customer's card and entering the purchase amount. Point of sale systems with integrated EFTPOS often sent the purchase total to the terminal and the customer swipes their own card. The customer then selects the account they wish to use: Current/Cheque (CHQ), Savings (SAV), or Credit Card (CRD), before entering in their PIN. After a short processing time in which the terminal contacts the EFTPOS network and the bank, the transaction is approved (or declined) and a receipt is printed. The EFTPOS system is used for credit cards as well, with a customer selecting Credit Card and entering their PIN, or for older credit cards without loaded PIN, pressing OK and signing their receipt with identification through matching signatures. Fixed EFTPOS terminals in most businesses utilise the public switched telephone network to contact the EFTPOS network, either utilising dedicated phone lines or sharing the merchant's voice line (especially in smaller businesses). The uptake of broadband internet in the 21st century has seen some terminals move to [[internet protocol]] connections.\n\nVirtually all retail outlets have EFTPOS facilities, so much that retailers without EFTPOS have to advertise so. In addition, an increasing number of mobile operator, such as taxis, stall holders and pizza deliverers have mobile EFTPOS systems. The system is made up of two primary networks: EFTPOS NZ, which is owned by [[VeriFone]]<ref>{{cite web|title=About EFTPOS NZ|url=https://eftpos.co.nz/about|publisher=EFTPOS NZ|accessdate=2014-12-09}}</ref> and Paymark Limited (formerly Electronic Transaction Services Limited), which is owned by ANZ Bank New Zealand, [[ASB Bank]], [[Westpac]] and the [[Bank of New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.paymark.co.nz/cms_display.php?sn=31&st=1 |title=New Zealand's leading electronic payments provider |publisher=Paymark |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514091441/https://www.paymark.co.nz/cms_display.php?st=1&sn=31 |archivedate=2012-05-14 |df= }}</ref> The two networks are intertwined and highly sophisticated and secure, able to handle huge volumes of transactions during busy periods such as the lead-up to Christmas: on 24 December 2012, the Paymark network alone recorded an average of 132 transactions per second between 12:00 and 13:00.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10856049 |title= Huge Boxing Day savings on offer |first= Amelia |last= Wade |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |date= 26 December 2012 |accessdate= 2013-05-15}}</ref> Network failures are rare, but when they occur they cause massive disruption, resulting in major delays and loss of income for businesses. Most businesses have to resort to manual \"zip-zap\" swipe machines in such case. Newer POS-based terminals have the ability to \"capture\" transactions in the event of a communications break-down - instead of entering a PIN, the customer signs their receipt and the transaction is approved on a matching signature, The transaction details are stored and sent for processing once the connection to the network is restored. A notable example of this occurs on the [[Cook Strait]] ferries, where in the middle of Cook Strait there is no mobile phone reception to connect to the EFTPOS network.\n\nDepending on the user's bank, a fee may be charged for use of EFTPOS. Most youth accounts (the minimum age to obtain an Eftpos card from most banks in New Zealand is 13 years) and an increasing number of 'electronic transaction accounts' do not attract fees for electronic transactions, meaning the use of Eftpos by younger generations has become ubiquitous and subsequently cash use has become rare. Typically merchants don't pay fees for transactions, most only having to pay for the equipment rental.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of New Zealand's well-established EFTPOS system is that it is incompatible with overseas systems and non-face-to-face purchases. In response to this, many banks since 2005 have introduced international debit cards such as [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] and Visa Debit which work online and overseas as well as on the New Zealand EFTPOS system.\n\n'''<big>Niger</big>'''\n\nPlease, see below on \"UEMOA\"\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], all three national ATM network consortia offer proprietary PIN debit. This was first offered by [[Express Payment System]] in 1987, followed by [[Megalink]] with Paylink in 1993 then [[BancNet]] with the [[Point-of-Sale]] in 1994.\n\n[[Express Payment System]] or EPS was the pioneer provider, having launched the service in 1987 on behalf of the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]. The EPS service has subsequently been extended in late 2005 to include the other Expressnet members: [[Banco de Oro]] and [[Land Bank of the Philippines]]. They currently operate 10,000 terminals for their cardholders.\n\nMegalink launched Paylink EFTPOS system in 1993. Terminal services are provided by Equitable Card Network on behalf of the consortium. Service is available in 2,000 terminals, mostly in [[Metro Manila]].\n\n[[BancNet]] introduced their point of sale system in 1994 as the first consortium-operated EFTPOS service in the country. The service is available in over 1,400 locations throughout the Philippines, including second and third-class municipalities. In 2005, BancNet signed a Memorandum of Agreement to serve as the local gateway for [[China UnionPay]], the sole ATM switch in the [[People's Republic of China]]. This will allow the estimated 1.0&nbsp;billion Chinese ATM cardholders to use the BancNet ATMs and the EFTPOS in all participating merchants.\n\nVisa debit cards are issued by [[Union Bank of the Philippines]] (e-Wallet & eon), [[Chinatrust]], [[Equicom Savings Bank]] (Key Card & Cash Card), [[Banco De Oro]], [[HSBC]], [[HSBC Savings Bank]], Sterling Bank of Asia (Visa ShopNPay prepaid and debit cards)& [[EastWest Bank]]. Union Bank of the Philippines cards, EastWest Visa Debit Card, Equicom Savings Bank & Sterling Bank of Asia EMV cards which can also be used for internet purchases. [[Sterling Bank of Asia]] has released its first line of prepaid and debit Visa cards with [[EMV]] chip.\n\nMasterCard debit cards are issued by Banco de Oro, [[Security Bank]] (Cashlink & Cash Card) & [[Smart Communications]] (Smart Money) tied up with Banco De Oro. MasterCard Electronic cards are issued by BPI (Express Cash) and Security Bank (CashLink Plus).\n\nOriginally, all Visa and MasterCard based debit cards in the Philippines are non-embossed and are marked either for \"Electronic Use Only\" (Visa/MasterCard) or \"Valid only where MasterCard Electronic is Accepted\" (MasterCard Electronic). However, [[EastWest Bank]] started to offer embossed Visa Debit Cards without the for \"Electronic Use Only\" mark. Paypass Debit MasterCard from other banks also have embossed labels without the for \"Electronic Use Only\" mark. Unlike credit cards issued by some banks, these Visa and MasterCard-branded debit cards do not feature EMV chips, hence they can only be read by the machines through swiping.\n\nBy March 21, 2016, [[BDO Unibank|BDO]] has started issuing sets of [[Debit MasterCards]] having the EMV chip and is the first Philippine bank to have it.<ref>http://www.philstar.com/business/2016/03/21/1564909/bdo-rolls-out-first-emv-mastercard-atm</ref> This is a response to the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|BSP]]'s monitor of the EMV shift progress in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Finance&title=bsp-to-start-monitoring-of-emv-shift-progress&id=134158|title=BusinessWorld - BSP to start monitoring of EMV shift progress|website=www.bworldonline.com}}</ref> By 2017, all Debit Cards in the country should have an EMV chip on it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsp.gov.ph/publications/media.asp?id=3593|title=Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas - Publications & Research|website=www.bsp.gov.ph}}</ref>\n\n===Poland===\nIn [[Poland]], the first system of electronic payments was operated by [[Orbis Technology|Orbis]], which later was changed to PolCard in 1991 (which also issued its own cards) and then that system was bought by [[First Data]] Poland Holding SA. In the mid-1990s international brands such as Visa, MasterCard, and the unembossed Visa Electron or Maestro were introduced.\n \nVisa Electron and Maestro work as a standard debit cards: the transactions are debited instantly, although it may happen on some occasions that a transaction is processed with some delay (hours, up to one day). These cards do not possess the options that credit cards have.\n\nIn the late 2000s contactless cards started to be introduced. The first technology to be used was MasterCard PayPass, later joined by Visa's payWave. This payment method is now universal and accepted almost everywhere. In an everyday use this payment method is always called Paypass.\nAlmost all business and stores in Poland accept debit and credit cards.\n\nIn the mid-2010s Polish banks started to replace unembossed cards with embossed electronic cards such as Debit MasterCard and Visa Debit, allowing the customers to own a card that has all qualities of a credit card (given that credit cards are not popular in Poland).\n\nThere are also some banks that do not possess an identification system to allow customers to order debit cards online.\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]], debit cards are accepted almost everywhere: ATMs, stores, and so on. The most commonly accepted are Visa and MasterCard, or the unembossed Visa Electron or Maestro. Regarding Internet payments debit cards cannot be used for transfers, due to its unsafeness, so banks recommend the use of 'MBnet', a pre-registered safe system that creates a virtual card with a pre-selected credit limit. All the card system is regulated by SIBS, the institution created by Portuguese banks to manage all the regulations and communication processes proply. SIBS' shareholders are all the 27 banks operating in Portugal.\n\n===Russia===\nIn addition to Visa, MasterCard and American Express, there are some local payment systems based in general on [[smart card]] technology.\n\n* [[Sbercard]]. This payment system was created by [[Sberbank]] around 1995\u20131996. It uses [[BGS Smartcard Systems AG]] smart card technology that is, DUET. Sberbank was a single retail bank in the [[Soviet Union]] before 1990. De facto this is a payment system of the SberBank.\n* [[Zolotaya Korona]]. This card brand was created in 1994. Zolotaya Korona is based on [[Center of Financial Technologies|CFT]] technology.\n* [[STB Card]]. This card uses the classic [[Magnetic Stripe Reader|magnetic stripe]] technology. It almost fully collapsed after 1998 (GKO crisis) with STB bank failure.\n* [[Union Card]]. The card also uses the classic [[Magnetic Stripe Reader|magnetic stripe]] technology. This card brand is on the decline. These accounts are being reissued as Visa or MasterCard accounts.\n\nNearly every transaction, regardless of brand or system, is processed as an immediate debit transaction. Non-debit transactions within these systems have spending limits that are strictly limited when compared with typical Visa or MasterCard accounts.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nIn [[Saudi Arabia]], all debit card transactions are routed through [[Saudi Payments Network]] (SPAN), the only electronic payment system in the Kingdom and all banks are required by the [[Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency]] (SAMA) to issue cards fully compatible with the network. It connects all point of sale (POS) terminals throughout the country to a central payment switch which in turn re-routes the financial transactions to the card issuer, local bank, Visa, Amex or MasterCard.\n\nAs well as its use for debit cards, the network is also used for ATM and credit card transactions.\n\n=== Senegal ===\n\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\n===Singapore===\nSingapore's debit service is managed by the [[Network for Electronic Transfers]] (NETS), founded by Singapore\u2019s leading banks and shareholders namely DBS, Keppel Bank, OCBC and its associates, OUB, IBS, POSB, Tat Lee Bank and UOB in 1985 as a result of a need for a centralised e-Payment operator.\n\nHowever, due to the banking restructuring and mergers, the local banks remaining were UOB, OCBC, DBS-POSB as the shareholders of NETS with Standard Chartered Bank to offer NETS to their customers. However, DBS and POSB customers can use their network atms on their own and not be shared with UOB, OCBC or SCB (StanChart). The mega failure of 5 July 2010 of POSB-DBS ATM Networks (about 97,000 machines) made the government to rethink the shared ATM system again as it affected the NETS system too.\n\nIn 2010, in line with the mandatory EMV system, Local Singapore Banks started to reissue their Debit Visa/MasterCard branded debit cards with EMV Chip compliant ones to replace the magnetic stripe system. Banks involved included NETS Members of POSB-DBS, UOB-OCBC-SCB along with the SharedATM alliance (NON-NETS) of HSBC, Citibank, State Bank of India, and Maybank. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) is also a SharedATM alliance member. Non branded cards of POSB and Maybank local ATM Cards are kept without a chip but have a Plus or Maestro sign which can be used to withdraw cash locally or overseas.\n\nMaybank Debit MasterCards can be used in Malaysia just like a normal ATM or Debit MEPS card.\n\nSingapore also uses the e-purse systems of NETS CASHCARD and the CEPAS wave system by [[EZ-Link]] and NETS.\n\n===Spain===\nDebit cards are accepted in a relatively larger amount of stores, both large and small in Spain. Banks often offer debit cards for small fees in connection with a chequing account. These cards are used more often than credit cards at ATMs because it is a cheaper alternative.\n\n===Taiwan===\nMost banks issue major-brand debit cards that can be used internationally such as [[Visa Debit|Visa]], [[MasterCard]] and [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]], often with contactless functionality. Payments at brick-and-mortar stores generally require a signature except for contactless payments.\n\nA separate, local debit system, known as Smart Pay, can be used by the majority of debit and ATM cards, even major-brand cards. This system is available only in Taiwan and a few locations in Japan as of 2016. Non-contactless payments require a PIN instead of a signature. Cards from a few banks support contactless payment with Smart Pay.\n\n=== Togo ===\n\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\n===UAE===\nDebit cards are widely accepted from different debit card issuers including the [[Network International]] local subsidiary of [[Emirates Bank]].\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom|UK]] debit cards (an integrated EFTPOS system) are an established part of the retail market and are widely accepted both by [[bricks and mortar]] stores and by internet stores. The term EFTPOS is not widely used by the public; debit card is the generic term used. Debit cards commonly issued are [[Debit MasterCard]] and [[Visa Debit]], with [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]], [[Visa Electron]] and [[UnionPay]] also in circulation. Banks do not charge customers for EFTPOS transactions in the UK, but some retailers make small charges, particularly where the transaction amount in question is small. The UK has converted all debit cards in circulation to [[Chip and PIN]] (except for Chip and Signature cards issued to people with certain disabilities and non-reloadable prepaid cards), based on the [[EMV]] standard, to increase transaction security; however, PINs are not required for Internet transactions (though some banks employ additional security measures for online transactions such as Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code), nor for most contactless transactions.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, banks started to issue debit cards in the mid-1980s in a bid to reduce the number of cheques being used at the point of sale, which are costly for the banks to process; the first bank to do so was [[Barclays Bank|Barclays]] with the ''Barclays Connect'' card. As in most countries, fees paid by merchants in the [[United Kingdom]] to accept credit cards are a percentage of the transaction amount,<ref name=\"electronic-payments.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electronic-payments.co.uk/pricing.jsp |title=Electronic payment system pricing |publisher=RSTO electronic-payments.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821153136/http://electronic-payments.co.uk/pricing.jsp |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}</ref> which funds card holders' interest-free credit periods as well as incentive schemes such as points or cashback. For consumer credit cards issued within the EEA, the interchange fee is capped at 0.3%, with a cap of 0.2% for debit cards, although the merchant acquirers may charge the merchant a higher fee. Although merchants won the right through [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/2159/contents/made The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990] to charge customers different prices according to the payment method, few merchants in the UK charge less for payment by debit card than by credit card, the most notable exceptions being [[budget airline]]s and [[travel agent]]s. Most debit cards in the UK lack the advantages offered to holders of UK-issued credit cards, such as free incentives (points, cashback etc. (the [[Tesco Bank]] debit card being one [http://www.tescobank.com/current-accounts/rewards.html exception])), interest-free credit and protection against defaulting merchants under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/section/75 Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974]. Almost all establishments in the United Kingdom that accept credit cards also accept debit cards, but a minority of merchants, for cost reasons, accept debit cards and not credit cards.\n\n=== UEMOA ===\n{{Main|Economic Community of West African States#West African Economic and Monetary Union}}\n\nIt is the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union federating eight countries: [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[Guinea-Bissau|Guin\u00e9e Bissau]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].\n\nGIM-UEMOA is the regional switch f\u00e9derating more than 120 members (banks, microfinances, electronic money issuers, etc.). All interbank cards transactions between banks in the same country or between banks in two different countries UEMOA zone are routed and cleared by GIM-UEMOA. The settlement is done on Central Bank RTGS.\n\nGIM-UEMOA also provides some processing products and services to more than 50 banks in UEMOA zone and out of UEMOA zone.\n\n===United States===\n{{Cleanup|section|reason=out of place text and missing citations|date=November 2015}}\nIn the U.S., EFTPOS is universally referred to simply as ''debit''.

This means that cards issued by one network will typically work anywhere they accept ATM/POS cards for payment. For example, a NYCE card will work at a Pulse POS terminal or ATM, and vice versa. Debit cards in the United States are usually issued with a Visa, MasterCard, [[Discover Card|Discover]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulsenetwork.com/payments/discover-debit.html | title=Discover Debit | publisher=PULSE Network}}</ref> or [[American Express]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www212.americanexpress.com/dsmlive/dsm/dom/us/en/personal/cardmember/additionalproductsandservices/giftcardsandtravelerscheques/gpr_home.do?vanity=americanexpress.com/prepaid&vgnextoid=afdd06393b3ec210VgnVCM100000defaad94RCRD&vgnextchannel=95ddb81e8482a110VgnVCM100000defaad94RCRD&appInstanceName=default&name=gpr_home&type=intbenefitdetail | title=Prepaid Cards | publisher=American Express}}</ref> logo allowing use of their signature-based networks.\n\nU.S. Federal law caps the liability of a U.S. debit card user in case of loss or theft at $50&nbsp;USD if the loss or theft is reported to the issuing bank in two business days after the customer notices the loss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/efta.pdf |format=pdf |work=Federal Reserve, Consumer Compliance Handbook |title=Electronic Fund Transfer Act | date=November 2013 | page=11}}</ref> Most banks will, however, set this limit to $0 for debit cards issued to their customers which are linked to their [[checking account|checking]] or [[savings account]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe fees charged to merchants for offline debit purchases vs. the lack of fees charged to merchants for processing online debit purchases and paper checks have prompted some major merchants in the U.S. to file [[lawsuit]]s against debit-card transaction processors, such as Visa and MasterCard. In 2003, Visa and MasterCard agreed to [[settlement (law)|settle]] the largest of these lawsuits for $2 billion and $1 billion respectively.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?em=&pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Martin | title=How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market | date=2010-01-05}}</ref>\n\nSome consumers prefer \"credit\" transactions because of the lack of a fee charged to the consumer/purchaser. A few debit cards in the U.S. offer rewards for using \"credit\". However, since \"credit\" transactions cost more for merchants, many terminals at PIN-accepting merchant locations now make the \"credit\" function more difficult to access. For example, if you swipe a debit card at [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] or [[Ross Stores|Ross]] in the U.S., you are immediately presented with the PIN screen for online debit. To use offline debit you must press \"cancel\" to exit the PIN screen, and then press \"credit\" on the next screen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAs a result of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], U.S. merchants can now set a minimum purchase amount for credit card transactions, as long as it does not to exceed $10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usa.visa.com/about_visa/ask_visa/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020012114/http://www.usa.visa.com/about_visa/ask_visa/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-20 |title=Ask Visa &#124; Visa USA |publisher=Usa.visa.com |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2012-12-30 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Andrew |url=http://www.paymentssource.com/news/merchants-debit-transactions-cheaper-3003058-1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114025447/http://www.paymentssource.com/news/merchants-debit-transactions-cheaper-3003058-1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-14 |title=Emboldened, Merchants Expected To Push Cheaper Payments |publisher=PaymentsSource Article |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2012-12-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====FSA, HRA, and HSA debit cards====\nIn the United States, an [[FSA debit card]] only allow medical expenses. It is used by some banks for withdrawals from their FSAs, [[medical savings account]]s (MSA), and [[health savings account]]s (HSA) as well. They have [[Visa (company)|Visa]] or MasterCard logos, but cannot be used as \"debit cards\", only as \"credit cards\". Furthermore, they are not accepted by all merchants that accept debit and credit cards, but only by those that specifically accept FSA debit cards. Merchant codes and product codes are used at the point of sale (required by law by certain merchants by certain states in the US) to restrict sales if they do not qualify.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Because of the extra checking and documenting that goes on, later, the statement can be used to [[Balance sheet substantiation|substantiate]] these purchases for tax deductions. In the occasional instance that a qualifying purchase is rejected, another form of payment must be used (a check or payment from another account and a claim for reimbursement later). In the more likely case that non-qualifying items are accepted, the consumer is technically still responsible, and the discrepancy could be revealed during an audit. A small but growing segment of the debit card business in the U.S. involves access to tax-favored spending accounts such as FSAs, HRAs, and HSAs. Most of these debit cards are for medical expenses, though a few are also issued for dependent care and transportation expenses.\n\nTraditionally, FSAs (the oldest of these accounts) were accessed only through claims for reimbursement after incurring, and often paying, an out-of-pocket expense; this often happens after the funds have already been deducted from the employee's paycheck. (FSAs are usually funded by payroll deduction.)  The only method permitted by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to avoid this \"double-dipping\" for medical FSAs and HRAs is through accurate and auditable reporting on the tax return. Statements on the debit card that say \"for medical uses only\" are invalid for several reasons: (1) The merchant and issuing banks have no way of quickly determining whether the entire purchase qualifies for the customer's type of tax benefit; (2) the customer also has no quick way of knowing; often has mixed purchases by necessity or convenience; and can easily make mistakes; (3) extra contractual clauses between the customer and issuing bank would cross-over into the payment processing standards, creating additional confusion (for example if a customer was penalized for accidentally purchasing a non-qualifying item, it would undercut the potential savings advantages of the account). Therefore, using the card exclusively for qualifying purchases may be convenient for the customer, but it has nothing to do with how the card can actually be used. If the bank rejects a transaction, for instance, because it is not at a recognized drug store, then it would be causing harm and confusion to the cardholder. In the United States, not all medical service or supply stores are capable of providing the correct information so an FSA debit card issuer can honor every transaction-if rejected or documentation is not deemed enough to satisfy regulations, cardholders may have to send in forms manually.\n\n===Uruguay===\nDebit cards are accepted in a relatively large number of stores, both large and small in Uruguay; but their use has so far remained low as compared to credit cards at ATMs. Since August 2014, with the [[Taxation in Uruguay|Financial Inclusion Law]] coming into force, end consumers obtain a 4% VAT deduction for using debit cards in their purchases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatlive.com/americas/uruguay-cuts-vat-rate-bank-card-purchases/ |title=Uruguay cuts VAT rate on electronic purchases |publisher=VAT Live |accessdate=2014-09-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Business and Economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Alternative Payments]]\n*[[ATM card]]\n*[[Debit card cashback]]\n*[[Electronic funds transfer]]\n*[[Electronic Payment Services]]\n*[[EPAS]]\n*[[Interac]]\n*[[Inventory information approval system]], a [[point-of-sale]] technology used with [[FSA debit card]]s\n*[[Payment card]]\n*[[Payments Council]]\n*[[Payoneer]]\n*[[Point-of-sale]] (POS)\n*[[USA Technologies Inc.]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Credit cards}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Debit Card}}\n[[Category:Payment systems]]\n[[Category:Debit cards|*]]\n[[Category:E-commerce]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]", "sha1": "qzxzf9uzcznagozqm48b3jylomss0kv"}}, {"title": "Dewar flask", "ns": "0", "id": "9009", "redirect": {"title": "Vacuum flask"}, "revision": {"id": "515502228", "parentid": "515451723", "timestamp": "2012-10-01T18:29:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Oknazevad", "id": "69423"}, "comment": "revert to merged version; the cryogenics specific version is at [[Cryogenic storage dewar]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Vacuum flask]]", "sha1": "epf8b2ul5dqpr4mo6dzu8yy1mdgr4h6"}}, {"title": "Dance Dance Revolution", "ns": "0", "id": "9010", "revision": {"id": "866076667", "parentid": "862185579", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T02:57:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Place portal link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox VG series\n|image = Dance Dance Revolution logo 2009.png\n|caption = ''Dance Dance Revolution'' logo (2009-present)\n|genre = [[Music video game|Music]], [[Exergaming|exercise]]\n|developer = [[Konami]]\n|publisher = Konami, [[Nintendo]], [[Disney]], Keen, Betson\n|platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]]<br>[[Bemani Pocket]]<br>[[Dreamcast]]<br>[[DVD game]]<br>[[Game Boy Color]]<br>[[GameCube]]<br>[[iOS]]<br>[[Microsoft Windows]]<br>[[Mobile game]]<br>[[Nintendo 64]]<br>[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]<br>[[PlayStation 2]]<br>[[PlayStation 3]]<br>[[TV game]]<br>[[Wii]]<br>[[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]<br>[[Xbox 360]]\n|first release version = ''[[Dance Dance Revolution (1998 video game)|Dance Dance Revolution]]''\n|first release date = September 26, 1998\n|latest release version = ''[[Dance Dance Revolution A]]''\n|latest release date = March 30, 2016\n|spinoffs = ''Dance Dance Revolution Solo''\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Dance Dance Revolution'''''|\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9\u30ec\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3|Dansu Dansu Rebory\u016bshon}} ('''''DDR'''''), also known as '''''Dancing Stage''''' in earlier games in Europe, Central Asia, Middle East, Africa, South Asia and Oceania, and also some other games in Japan, is a [[music video game]] series produced by [[Konami]]. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the [[Bemani]] series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, ''Dance Dance Revolution'' is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance [[Video game genre|genre]] in video games. Players stand on a \"dance platform\" or stage and hit colored [[Arrow Cross|arrows laid out in a cross]] with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.\n\n''Dance Dance Revolution'' has been met with critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of [[Arcade game|arcade]]-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home [[video game console]] releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of [[Music licensing|licensed music]] from many different genres. The ''DDR'' series has inspired similar games such as ''[[List of Pump it Up video games|Pump it Up]]'' by [[Andamiro]] and ''[[In the Groove (series)|In the Groove]]'' by [[Roxor Games]]. The latest release is ''[[Dance Dance Revolution A]]'', which premiered in 2016.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe core gameplay involves the player stepping their feet to correspond with the arrows that appears on screen and the beat. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over a set of stationary arrows near the top (referred to as the \"guide arrows\" or \"receptors\", officially known as the Step Zone). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform, and the player is given a judgement for their accuracy of every streaked notes (From highest to lowest: Marvelous,<ref>First appeared in the Nonstop and Challenge mode of DDR Extreme and first used for normal gameplay as of DDR SuperNova 2.</ref> Perfect, Great, Good, Almost,<ref>Boo for DDR 5thMIX and earlier. Not present in DDR X2 onwards.</ref> Miss<ref>Boo for DDR SuperNOVA1, DDR SuperNOVA2, and DDR X only.</ref>).\n\nAdditional arrow types are added in later mixes. ''Freeze Arrows'', introduced in ''[[DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix|DDRMAX]]'', are long green arrows that must be held down until they completely travel through the Step Zone. Each of these arrows awards an \"O.K.!\" if successfully pressed or an \"N.G.\" when the arrow is released too quickly. An \"N.G.\" decreases the life bar and, starting with ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X|DDR X]]'', also breaks any existing combo. ''DDR X'' also introduced ''Shock Arrows'', walls of arrows with lightning effects which must be avoided, awarding an \"O.K.!\" if successfully avoided or an \"N.G.\" if any of the dancer's panels are stepped on. An \"N.G.\" for shock arrows has the same consequences found with freeze arrows, but hitting a shock arrow additionally hides future steps for a short period of time.\n\nSuccessfully hitting the arrows in time with the music fills the \"Dance Gauge\", or [[life bar]], while failure to do so drains it. If the Dance Gauge is fully exhausted during gameplay, the player will fail the song, and the game will be over. Otherwise, the player is taken to the Results Screen, which rates the player's performance with a [[letter grade]] and a numerical [[score (video games)|score]], among other statistics. The player may then be given a chance to play again, depending on the settings of the particular machine. The default limit is of three songs, though operators can set the limit between one and five.\n\nAside from play style Single, Dance Dance Revolution provides two other play styles: Versus, where two players can play Single simultaneously, and Double, where one player uses all eight panels. Prior to the 2013 release of ''Dance Dance Revolution'', some games offer additional modes, such as Course mode (players must play a set of songs back-to-back) and Battle mode (two players compete with a tug-of-war life bar by sending distracting modifiers to each other). Earlier versions also have Couple/Unison Mode, where two players must cooperate to play the song. This mode later become the basis for \"TAG Play\" in newer games.\n\n===Difficulty===\nDepending on the edition of the game, dance steps are broken into various levels of difficulty, often by colour. Difficulty is loosely separated into 3\u20135 categories depending on timeline:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year range !!

In addition, each difficulty rating would also be labeled with a title.<ref>1 for Simple, 2 for Moderate, 3 for Ordinary, 4 for Superior, 5 for Marvelous, 6 for Genuine, 7 for Paramount, 8 for Exorbitant.</ref> DDR 2nd Mix Club Version 2 increased the scale to 9,<ref>9 for: Catastrophic in DDR 3rdMIX, Evolutionary in the DDR 2ndMIX mode of DDR X3 vs DDR 2ndMIX.</ref> which would be implemented in the main series beginning in DDR 3rd Mix. DDR 3rd Mix also renamed the Maniac difficulty to \"SSR\" and made it playable through a special mode (SSR Mode), which can only be accessed via input code and is played on Flat (all arrows are the same color) by default. The SSR mode was eliminated in 3rdMix Plus, and the Maniac routines were folded back into the regular game. In addition to the standard three difficulties, the first three titles of the series and their derivations also featured a \"Easy\" mode (\"Soft\" in 3rd Mix), which provided simplified step charts for songs (and reduced song list in some versions). In this mode, one cannot access other difficulties, akin to the aforementioned SSR mode. While this mode is never featured again, it would become the basis for the fully accessible Beginner difficulty implemented in newer games. DDR 4th Mix removed the names of the song and made it simple by removing those names and organizing the difficulty by order. DDR 4th Mix Plus renamed several song's Maniac charts as Maniac-S (for Single) and Maniac-D (for Double), while adding newer and harder stepcharts for the old ones as the \"second\" Maniac. These new charts were used as the default Maniac stepchart in DDR 5th Mix while the older ones were removed.\n\nBeginning in DDRMAX, a \"Groove Radar\" was introduced, showing how difficult a particular sequence is in various categories, such as the maximum density of steps, and so on. The step difficulty was removed in favor of the Groove Radar. DDRMAX2 (and subsequent versions) re-added the foot ratings and restored the pre-4th Mix Plus Maniac stepcharts as the default Heavy stepcharts. DDRMAX2 also increased the difficulty scale to 10<ref>10 for Revolutionary in the DDR 2ndMIX mode of DDR X3 vs DDR 2ndMIX.</ref> (with the existing boss song, \"MAX 300\" from DDRMAX revealed to be the first) and added an official Oni/Challenge difficulty which can only be accessed in Oni/Challenging Mode. On DDR Extreme, Beginner difficulty is added for beginners and the Oni/Challenge is freely accessible. The game also adds the infamous \"flashing 10\" foot for songs that are considered too hard to be rated normally and only exists in several songs.\n\nAlthough DDR SuperNova still has the foot ratings, it removed the flashing 10-foot that existed on certain songs for unknown reasons. Later on, DDR SuperNOVA2 removed the foot rating and replaced it with bars. However, all songs from the previous games remain identical, with very few changes to certain song difficulties.\n\nOn ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'', the foot/bar rating system was given its first major overhaul, now ranking songs on a scale of 1-20, the first 10 represented by yellow bars, and the second 10 represented by additional red blocks shown in place of yellow bars. All songs from previous versions were re-rated on the new scale. The same system was carried over to ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X2]]'', although the difficulty bars were removed, replaced by simple difficulty numbers with the foot mark returning as the difficulty symbol for the first time since DDR SuperNova. There is currently no song that is officially rated maximum (20); the highest rating available is 19, shared between six songs: ''POSSESSION'' on Double Challenge, and ''EGOISM 440'', ''ENDYMION'', ''Over The \"Period\"'', ''PARANOiA Revolution'', and ''Valkyrie dimension'' on Single Challenge and Double Challenge. However, the game still allows players to rate their custom edit data up to maximum.\n\n===Groove Radar===\n{{See also|DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix#Groove Radar}}\n\nThe foot-rating system was completely removed for 6th Mix, and replaced by the ''Groove Radar''. The Groove Radar is a [[star plot|graphical representation]] of the difficulty of a song based in five different areas: Stream, Voltage, Air, Chaos, and Freeze.\n\n*''Stream'' - Indicates the overall density of the steps of the song. A high number of steps is not necessary for a high stream measurement (although it is a factor), since the songs' running time may range from as short as 1 minutes and 17 seconds to as long as 2 minutes and 17 seconds (not counting the long versions/Xmix, which go beyond 3 minutes).\n*''Voltage'' - Indicates the peak density of the steps (the highest density of arrows that ever appear on the screen at once). Songs with a high BPM (300 or more) usually have a high voltage measurement, since it allows more steps to appear in increasingly halved beats (4th step in a 300 BPM song equals to 8th beat step in a 150 BPM song, and so on), though songs with lower BPM can have a high voltage, even if the halved beats usually cap at 32nd beat (64th beat steps exist in very few songs).\n*''Chaos'' - Indicates \"off-beat\" steps; those that do not occur in 4th or 8th beats. \n*''Air'' - Indicates the amount of double steps (i.e. jumps) and shock arrows within the song.\n*''Freeze'' - Indicates the number of freeze arrows within the song\n\nEach game usually has a song that max out a category within the radar. If a song in a following mix or update has a higher category measurement, then the groove radar is renewed so the new song can max out that category, while all previous songs are re-rated in respect to the new radar.\n\nAs of the 2014 update to ''[[Dance Dance Revolution (2013 video game)|Dance Dance Revolution]]'', the groove radar also employs a numerical measurement in addition to a graphical representation. Before the update, the radar did not disclose the number by default, though it could be shown by holding the SELECT button while heading to the song select screen.\n\nThe Groove Radar was not very popular among seasoned DDR veterans. The foot-rating system would be restored to work with the Groove Radar in the [[DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution|North American home version of the game]] and in the next arcade version, ''[[DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution 7thMix|DDRMAX2]]'', and almost all future versions (except for versions based on the [[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme (North America)|North American version of Extreme]], which only use foot ratings). All of the 6th Mix songs on 7thMix received foot-ratings, excluding songs that are removed from DDRMAX2.\n\nSuperNOVA 2 featured special edits of songs specifically meant to max out specific categories on the radar, culminating with ''Dead End (Groove Radar Special)'', maxing out all 5 categories. While not related, SuperNOVA 2 also featured a variation known as \"My Groove Radar\" as part of e-Amusement, which is also divided into five categories, though it is meant to measure the player's stats on songs rather than showing the song's difficulty.\n\n===Extra Stage system===\nThe Extra Stage, originally introduced in 1st Mix and reintroduced in DDRMAX (and appears in subsequent arcade versions), rewards a player for receiving a grade of \"AA\" or higher on either Expert or Challenge difficulties on the final stage. The player receives the opportunity to play a free extra song, which often defaults to a very difficult song with forced modifiers (such as 1.5x speed and Reverse) and a life bar identical to the battery bar similar to Challenge mode with 1-4 lives depending on their score in the final stage (or a non-regaining life bar before Supernova 2). Beginning on SuperNova 2, players may be able to access the modifier menu and the forced modifiers (save for the battery bar) are no longer used. However, the Replicant-D Action event in DDR X2 did not allow players to select modifiers for its Encore Extra Stage.\n\nThe default song for the extra stage is predetermined, although as of Extreme, any song can be played on the extra stage, although there is still a song that is designated as ''the'' Extra Stage (which usually is marked with red letters* on the song wheel, and must be unlocked for regular play). A player who attains a grade of \"AA\" (or \"A\" in SuperNova) on the Extra Stage is invited to play an additional stage, \"One More Extra Stage\" (OMES, or Encore Extra Stage post-SuperNova), with another special song option played in sudden death mode, in which any combo-breaking step or missed freeze will cause an instant failure. Since DDR X3 vs 2ndMIX, some Encore Extra Stage songs are marked as \"ATTACK PERFECT FULL COMBO\", where any judgement less than Perfect will cause the player to fail the song. SuperNova 2 and X allowed players to play any song for Encore Extra Stage, but X2 went back to the original predetermined songs, though the players are still able to change the modifiers. Usually if this final boss is beaten, a special credits sequence is played.\n\nWith the implementation of [[e-Amusement]] in DDR, mixes after SuperNova have contained multiple songs as extra stages, often based on specific conditions, such as playing specific difficulties or songs.\n\nFrom 7th Mix onward, the BPM of Extra Stage songs was displayed as a random, changing number, instead of the song's true BPM. For every Extra Stage song except for MAX. (period), the random BPM display was replaced with the normal BPM display in the next mix, and as of ''Dance Dance Revolution X'', after said song has been unlocked for normal play.\n\n==Hardware==\n\n===Arcade machines===\nA standard ''Dance Dance Revolution'' arcade machine consists of two parts, the [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] and the dance platform. The cabinet has a wide bottom section, which houses large floor speakers and glowing [[neon lamp]]s (led on X cabinets and hide lights on white cabinets). Above this sits a narrower section that contains the [[computer display|monitor]], and on top is a lighted marquee graphic, with two small speakers and flashing lights on either side. Below the monitor are two sets of buttons (one for each player), each consisting of two triangular selection buttons (four on X and white cabinets) and a center rectangular button, used mainly to confirm a selection or start the game.\n[[File:Dance Dance Revolution Extreme arcade machine left side stage.png|thumb|left|200px|The dance stage, divided into 9 sections, 4 of them in the cardinal directions contain pressure sensors for the detection of steps.]]\nThe [[dance pad|dance stage]] is a raised metal platform divided into two sides. Each side houses a set of four [[acrylic glass]] pads<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betson.com/parts/Konami/1-10|title=Betson Parts Home page|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref> arranged and pointing in the orthogonal directions (left, up, down and right), separated by metal squares. Each pad sits atop four pressure activated switches, one at each edge of each pad, and a software-controlled [[cold cathode]] lamp illuminating the translucent pad, not available on the white cabinet. A metal safety bar in the shape of an upside-down \"U\" is mounted to the dance stage behind each player. Some players make use of this safety bar to help maintain proper balance, and to relieve weight from the legs so that arrows can be pressed with greater speed and accuracy.\n\nSome DDR cabinets are equipped with Sony PlayStation memory card slots, allowing the player to insert a compatible memory card before starting a game and save their high scores to the card. Additionally, the equivalent home versions of DDR allow players to create and save custom step patterns (edits) to their memory card \u2014 the player can then play those steps on the arcade machine if the same song exists on that machine. This feature is supported in 2ndMix through Extreme. SuperNova didn't support memory card slots. However, it introduced Konami's internet based link system ''[[e-Amusement]]'' to the series, which can save stats and unlocks for individual players (but cannot store edits). This functionality however, could only be used in Japan. During the North American release of [[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2]], an e-Amuse capable machine was made available at a Brunswick Zone Arcade in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. This machine was hosted on a different network than the Japanese version, and the only other machine on the network was located in Konami's American branch in [[El Segundo, California]]. e-Amusement functionality would later be made available in North America with the release of [[Dance Dance Revolution A]].\n\nThe Solo arcade cabinet is smaller and contains only one dance pad, modified to include six arrow panels instead of four (the additional panels are \"upper-left\" and \"upper-right\"). These pads generally don't come with a safety bar, but include the option for one to be installed at a later date. The Solo pad also lacks some of the metal plating that the standard pad has, which can make stepping difficult for players who are used to playing on standard machines. An upgrade was available for Solo machines called the \"Deluxe pad\", which was closer to the standard cabinet's pad. Additionally Solo machines only incorporate two sensors, located horizontally in the center of the arrow, instead of four sensors (one on each edge).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics !! colspan=5 | Arcade cabinets (first generation)\n|-\n!

DDR 3rdMix replaces this with a slightly upgraded Bemani System 573 Digital which would be used up to ''DDR Extreme''. Both of these are based on PlayStation.\n\nBeginning in ''Dancing Stage Fusion'', the hardware is replaced by Bemani Python, a PlayStation 2-based hardware. In the next version, ''DDR SuperNova'', this was changed to Bemani Python 2 which was first introduced on the fellow Bemani game ''GuitarFreaks V and Drummania V''. Bemani Python 2 would also be used in the followup ''DDR SuperNova 2''.\n\nAlong with the cabinet change, ''DDR X'' also changes its hardware to the PC-based Bemani PC Type 4.

Originally released in Japan as an [[arcade game]] and then a Sony [[PlayStation]] game, which was a bestseller.<ref>[[Dengeki PlayStation]] sales chart, August 1999, published in [[Official UK PlayStation Magazine]] issue 48</ref> DDR was later released in North American, Europe, Korea, the whole of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America and Mexico on multiple platforms including the Sony [[PlayStation 2]], Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], Nintendo [[Wii]], and many others. Due to demand, Japanese versions of the game, which are usually different from the games released in other countries, are often [[import]]ed or [[Copyright infringement|bootlegged]]. DDR fansites make an attempt to keep track of the locations of arcade machines throughout the major regions.\n\n===Home releases===\n[[File:DDR HandController.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The use of dedicated [[gamepads]] is only possible on home console versions.]]\n\nDDR games have been released on various [[video game console]]s, including the [[PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[GameCube]], [[Wii]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]], and even [[personal computer|PCs]]. Home versions often contain new songs, songs from the arcade version, and additional features that take advantage of the capabilities of the console (e.g.; Xbox 360 versions such as the [[Dance Dance Revolution Universe]] series include support for online multiplayer and downloadable songs over [[Xbox Live]], and high definition graphics). DDR has even reached Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]], with five versions of ''[[Dance Dance Revolution GB]]'' released in Japan; these included a series of three mainstream DDR games, a Disney Mix, and an Oha Star. The games come with a small thumb pad that fits over the Game Boy Color's controls to simulate the dance pad.\n\nHome versions are commonly bundled with soft plastic [[dance pad]]s that are similar in appearance and function to the [[Nintendo]] [[Power Pad]]. Some third-party manufacturers produce hard metal pads at a higher price.\n\nA version of DDR was also produced for the PC in North America. It uses the interface of ''[[Dance Dance Revolution 4thMix]]'', and contains around 40 songs from the first six mainstream arcade releases. It has not been as well received as the console versions.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Similar games==\n[[Image:Stemania4 Alpha4.png|250px|thumb|right|Gameplay screen in ''StepMania 4'', an open source ''DDR'' clone.]]\n\nDue to the success of the ''Dance Dance Revolution'' franchise, many other games with similar or identical gameplay have been created.\n\nCommercial competitors of ''DDR'' include the Korean series ''[[List of Pump it Up video games|Pump It Up]]'' and the American series ''[[In the Groove (series)|In the Groove]]'' by Roxor Games, as well as [[TechnoMotion]] by [[F2 Systems]], ''[[EZ2Dancer]]'' by [[Amuseworld]], and ''[[MC Groovz Dance Craze]]'' by [[Mad Catz]].\n\n''In the Groove'' was met with [[Konami Corp. v. Roxor Games Inc.|legal action by Konami]] and resulted in Konami's acquisition of the game's [[intellectual property]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/konami-reaches-settlement-in-ddr-lawsuit|title=Publisher acquires rights to Roxor game |accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref>\n\nA Christian version of ''DDR'', named ''[[Dance Praise]]'', has been made by [[Digital Praise]]. [[Ubisoft]] produced a dance game based on [[Disney]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' titled ''[[The Jungle Book Groove Party]]''.\n\nFan-made versions of ''DDR'' have also been created, many freely available to the public under [[open source]] licenses. The most popular of these is ''[[StepMania]]'', upon which the game ''In the Groove'' is based. These simulators allow for players to create and play their own songs to their own programmed steps. As a result, many ''DDR'' fans have held contests and released \"mixes\" of custom songs and steps for these simulators. Notably the Japanese ''Foonmix'' series and the [[DDR East Invasion]] Tournamix competitions. Other simulators include ''[[Dance With Intensity]]'' and ''[[pyDance]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], both of which are no longer developed, and ''[[Feet of Fury]]'', a [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] game for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].\n\nBesides direct clones, many other games have been released that center around rhythm and dance due to ''DDR''{{'}}s popularity. ''[[Dance! Online]]'' released by [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] combines [[dance pad]] play with an [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] element. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Dancing with the Stars (video game)|Dancing With the Stars]]'' and [[Codemasters]]' ''[[Dance Factory (game)|Dance Factory]]'' are more recent examples of games that pay homage to ''DDR'' and the genre it created. Konami uses music from its other rhythm game series such as ''[[Beatmania]]'' and ''[[Beatmania IIDX]]'', ''[[Drummania]]'', ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'', and ''[[Pop'n Music]]'', as well as making references to ''DDR'' in its other games and vice versa.\n\n==''Dance Dance Revolution'' today==\nTournaments are held worldwide, with participants usually competing for higher scores or number of Perfects (referred to as \"Perfect Attack\" tournaments). Less common are \"freestyle\" tournaments, where players develop actual dance routines to perform while following the steps in the game.<ref>IGN Staff [http://psx.ign.com/articles/084/084175p1.html IGN: Dance Dance Revolution Tournament Report], Retrieved on 2008-05-23.</ref>\n\n===Playing styles===\nMany ''DDR'' players, in order to better get better scores by focusing on timing and pattern reading, will minimize any extraneous body movement during gameplay. These players are commonly referred to as \"technical\", \"tech\" or \"perfect attack\" (PA) players. These technical players usually play the most difficult songs on the highest difficulty levels in an attempt to perfect their scores, and the most elite players are able to get perfect or near perfect scores on all of the hardest songs in the game. The more \"technical\" a song gets the more the player must use minimalistic movements in order to hit all the arrows with perfection. These players perfect using their heels as well and often hold on to the bar to take weight off their feet enabling them to move faster and tire more slowly. This style of play is the focus of most competitions.\n\nOther ''DDR'' players choose to incorporate complex or flashy techniques into their play movements, and some of these \"freestyle\" players develop intricate dance routines to perform during a song. Freestyle players tend to choose songs on lower difficulty levels, so that the player is not restricted in their movements by large quantities of required steps. Some players can even dance facing away from the screen.\n\nSomewhere in the middle are the players which choose to do a little bit of both of the formers. There are criticisms of the In The Groove style of play which focuses on \"perfect attack\". More traditional players say it takes the fun away from the game the harder the step-charts get, which makes players use much less movement overall to conserve stamina. By doing this, it is no longer a dance game and many arrows do not fit perfectly with the beat because there are simply too many of them. The middle players enjoy moving to the beat and still trying to improve their scores without having to adopt the In the Groove style of play.\n\nA freestyling act can also involve performing other stunts while playing. On an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s short-lived series ''[[Master of Champions]]'', Billy Matsumoto won the episode when he played 5th Mix's \"Can't Stop Fallin' In Love (Speed Mix)\" on Heavy mode while juggling three lit torches.{{Citation needed|reason=No citations for dancing style or the Master of Champions episode.|date=January 2018}}\n\n===As exercise===\nMany news outlets have reported how playing ''DDR'' can be good [[aerobic exercise]]; some regular players have reported [[weight loss]] of 10\u201350 pounds (5\u201320&nbsp;kg). In one example, a player found that including ''DDR'' in her day-to-day life resulted in a loss of {{convert|95|lb}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getupmove.com/weightloss/tanya.asp  |title=Welcome to Get Up Move! |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2010-09-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011193120/http://getupmove.com/weightloss/tanya.asp |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> Some other examples would be Matthew Keene's account of losing upwards of {{convert|150|lb}} and Yashar Esfandi's claim of losing {{convert|85|lb}} in four months through incorporation of ''DDR''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getupmove.com/weightloss/matt.asp |title=Welcome to Get Up Move! |date=4 December 2005 |publisher= |accessdate=5 November 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204022559/http://www.getupmove.com/weightloss/matt.asp |archivedate=4 December 2005 |df= }}</ref> Although the quantity of calories burned by playing ''DDR'' have not been scientifically measured, the amount of active movement required to play implies that ''DDR'' provides at least some degree of healthy exercise.\n\nMany home versions of the game have a function to estimate calories burned, given a player's weight. Additionally, players can use \"workout mode\" to make a diary of calories burned playing DDR and any self-reported changes in the player's weight.\n\n===Use in schools===\nAt the start of 2006, Konami announced that the ''DDR'' games would be used as part of a fitness program to be phased into [[West Virginia]]'s 765 state schools, starting with its 103 middle schools, over the next two years.<ref name=\"MTVNews\">{{Cite news|title=West Virginia Adds Dance Dance Revolution to Gym Class|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521605/20060125/index.jhtml?headlines=true|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> The program was conceived by a researcher at [[West Virginia University]]'s Motor Development Center.\n\n[[California Institute of Technology]] allows its students to use ''DDR'' to fulfill part of its [[physical education]] requirement, as students may design their own fitness program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pr.caltech.edu/catalog/courses/listing/pe.html#mytarget|title=Caltech Course Catalog- Physical Education}}</ref>\n\n[[University of Kansas]] has a class for ''Dance Dance Revolution'' open for students to take as a 1 credit hour course.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weslander |first=Eric |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/aug/11/dance_dance_revolution_cyberculture_ku_offers_dive/ |title=10 cool classes / LJWorld.com |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=2007-08-11 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Cyber Coach]] has sold in excess of 600 systems in schools in the UK and features the ''DDR'' game ''Disco Disco 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Cyber-coach.co.uk|title=Home - Cyber Coach Smart|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===As a sport===\nIn 2004, ''Dance Dance Revolution'' became an official sporting event in Norway.<ref name=\"DDRNorway\">{{Cite news|title=Positive Gaming: Machine Dance as Fitness and Sport|url=http://www.positivegaming.com/company/index.php?id=fitness|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011214904/http://positivegaming.com/company/index.php?id=fitness |archivedate=2007-10-11|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cie.acm.org/articles/international-survey-on-the-dance-dance-revolution-game/|title=International survey on the Dance Dance Revolution game|first=Johanna|last=Hoysniemi|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}</ref> The first official club, DDR Oslo, was founded in 2004. The tournaments in Norway were divided into two parts, first there was a group play where the 2 or 3 best players from each group went to the final rounds. Elimination of the player with the lowest game score was used for each round in the finals. The scoring system used was based on people dancing to 2 or 3 songs. Some of the songs were selected randomly and had to be played by everyone.  The others were player-chosen, which introduced some strategy into the game, as some songs had higher possible scoring than others. ''[[Dancing Stage EuroMix 2]]'' was used for the Norwegian tournaments.\n\nIn recent years, ''Dance Dance Revolution'' has been promoted by Konami as an [[e-Sport]], mainly through their own competitive tournament, the ''Konami Arcade Championship''. The tournament allows players in Japan, South Korea, and select Asian regions to sign up and play in specific online events to earn a spot in the grand finals, typically held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The 6th Annual tournament, which concluded on February 11, 2017, was notable for being the first time that competitors from the United States were eligible to enter. The 7th Annual event, which concluded on February 10, 2018, added Indonesia and Canada as eligible competitor regions.\n\n==Awards==\nThe success of the Dance Dance Revolution series has resulted in two Guinness World Records: \"Longest Dance Dance Revolution Marathon\" which is currently held by Alex Skudlarek at 16 hours, 18 minutes, and nine seconds. and \"Most Widely Used Video Game in Schools.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = |last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1904994213|location = |pages = }}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n==Film==\nOn October 2, 2018, [[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]] reported that Cara Fano would be supervising the production of a film based on the series.

The two powers promised each other support in case of attack by Russia. Also, each state promised [[benevolent neutrality]] to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be [[French Third Republic|France]], even more so after the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894). Germany\u2019s [[Otto von Bismarck]] saw the alliance as a way to prevent the isolation of the German Empire, which had just been founded a few years before, and to preserve peace, as Russia would not wage war against both empires.\n\n==Formation==\nWhen Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though both realms shared the German language and a similar culture, Austria-Hungary and Germany were often driven apart, most notably in the recent [[Austro-Prussian War]]. Additionally, the Habsburg rulers of Austria believed that the promotion of nationalism, which was favored by Germany, would destroy their multinational empire. However, their common dislike for Russia brought the two nations together for a common cause.<ref>Martel, Gordon. ''The Origins of the First World War''. Third edition, 2003, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Alliance against Russia==\nAfter the formation of the German Empire in 1871, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck wanted to portray his nation as a peacemaker and preserver of the European status quo, as well as gain more power for the German Empire and unify Germany. In 1878, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]]; the resulting [[Treaty of San Stefano]] gave Russia considerable influence in the [[Balkans]]. This development outraged Austria-Hungary, who was Russia's chief competitor for influence in the Balkan region (despite being an ally of the Russians and the Germans in the [[League of the Three Emperors]]). Hence, in 1878, Bismarck called an international conference (the [[Congress of Berlin]]) in order to sort out the problem. The [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] that resulted from the conference reversed Russia's gains from the Treaty of San Stefano and provided the Austrians with compensation in the form of [[Vilayet of Bosnia|Bosnia]]. Despite Bismarck's attempts to play the role of an \"honest broker\" at the Congress of Berlin, Russo-German relations deteriorated following the conference. The Three Emperors' League was discontinued, and Germany and Austria-Hungary were free to ally with one another against Russia.\n\n==Italy, new ally==\nIn 1881, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italy]] lost in the competition with France to establish a colony in ''Tunis'' (present-day [[Tunisia]]). To enlist diplomatic support, Italy joined Germany and Austria-Hungary to form the ''[[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]'' in 1882, which was the first formal war-camp in Europe, the second being the [[Triple Entente]], an informal alliance, formed in 1907.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], however, Italy did not go to war immediately with its allies but stayed neutral. In 1915, it joined the Entente powers and declared war on Austria-Hungary, and later Germany in the subsequent year. The Dual Alliance persisted throughout the war, known as the [[Central Powers]], and ended with their defeat in 1918.\n\n==References<ref>\"Austro-German Alliance\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Originally concerned with [[infants]] and [[child]]ren, the field has expanded to include [[adolescence]], [[adult development]], [[aging]], and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions: [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], and socioemotional development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|title=Developmental Psychology Studies Human Development Across the Lifespan|last=|first=|date=|website=www.apa.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709054242/http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|archive-date=2014-07-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including [[motor skills]], [[executive functions]], [[morality|moral understanding]], [[language acquisition]], [[social change]], [[personality]], emotional development, [[self-concept]], and [[identity formation]].\n\nDevelopmental psychology examines the influences of nature ''and'' nurture on the process of human development, and processes of change in context and across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior and [[environmental factor]]s, including the [[social context]] and the [[built environment]]. Ongoing debates include biological [[essentialism]] vs. [[neuroplasticity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]] vs. dynamic systems of development.\n\nDevelopmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as [[educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]], [[forensic developmental psychology]], [[child development]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[ecological psychology]], and [[cultural psychology]]. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Barbara Rogoff]], [[Esther Thelen]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]].\n\n==Historical antecedents==\n[[John B. Watson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.<ref name=Hogan>{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=John D|authorlink=John D.

Kazdin|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/10518-003|year=2000}}</ref> In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: ''infants'' (infancy), ''puer'' (childhood) and ''adolescence'' in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.\n\nIt generally focuses on how and why certain modifications throughout an individual\u2019s life-cycle (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) and human growth change over time. There are many theorists that have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. For example, [[Erik Erikson]] developed a model of eight stages of psychological development. He believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and this would affect their behaviors (Similar ideas to [[Sigmund Freud]])<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erikson and Erikson|first1=E and J. M.|title=The Life-Cycle Completed|date=1998|publisher=Norton and Company|edition=Extended version}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development;<ref name=Hogan /> prominent here was the pioneering psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]],<ref name=Hogan /> who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity. [[James Mark Baldwin]] who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. [[James Mark Baldwin]] was heavily involved in the theory of developmental psychology.<ref name=Hogan /> [[Sigmund Freud]], whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions.<ref name=Hogan />\n\n==Theories==\n\n===Psychosexual development===\n{{Main|Psychosexual development}}\n[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious, we are aware of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.\n\nHe believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.<ref name=\"Theories2\">{{cite book|title=Theories of personality: understanding persons|last=Cloninger|first=Susan C.|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-25624-2|edition=6th|location=Boston|pages=19\u2013101}}</ref> The superego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.<ref name=\"Snowden2\">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nBased on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each is characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy. The first is the ''oral stage'', which occurs from birth to 12 months of age. During the oral stage, \"the libido is centered in a baby's mouth.\" The baby is able to suck. The second is the ''anal stage'', from one to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation. The third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty. During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed. Stage five is the ''[[genital stage]]'', which takes place from puberty until adulthood.

The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.<ref name=\"Adolescence3\">{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60\u2013365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}</ref>\n\nKohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development.

The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is \"Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt\" with the best virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt. The third stage is \"Initiative vs. Guilt\". The basic virtue that would be gained is the purpose and takes place in the play age. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other children. The fourth stage is \"Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority\". The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and fit in and understand the value of their accomplishments. The fifth stage is \"Identity vs. Role Confusion\". The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence. This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society. What sex role he/she picks. The sixth stage is \"Intimacy vs. Isolation\", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. In not doing so, it could lead to isolation. The seventh stage is \"Generativity vs. Stagnation\". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care. We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community. The eighth stage is \"Ego Integrity vs. Despair\". This happens during maturity and wisdom is gained. When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and see the success or failure of their life. This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.<ref>{{citation|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Erik Erikson|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html|year=2013|accessdate=23 July 2016|orig-year=2008|website=Simply Psychology}}</ref>\n\n===Theories of cognitive development===\n{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}\n[[Jean Piaget]], a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.<ref name=\"WoodWoodBoyd2\">{{Cite book|title=Mastering the world of psychology|publisher=Allyn & Bacon|year=2006|edition=2|author1=Wood, S.E.|author2=Wood, C.E.|author3=Boyd D.}}</ref> He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.\n\nPiaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''. Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.<ref name=\"Edpsych24\">{{cite book|title=Edpsych : modules|last=Reese-Weber|first=Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|isbn=978-0-07-809786-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=30\u2013132}}</ref>\n\n===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===\n{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}\n[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified of Inhelder and Piaget's developmental and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.  A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages. The stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory & Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmatic. The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.\n\nIn the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.\n\n===Ecological systems theory===\n{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}\n[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]\nEcological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments|last1=Sincero|first1=Sarah Mae}}</ref>\n\nThe microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).<ref name=\"Edpsych24\"/>\n\nSince its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''<ref>Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ({{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}})</ref> has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments\u2014from the family to economic and political structures\u2014have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood.<ref name=\"Smith et al.2\">{{Cite book|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Blackwell|edition=4|series=Basic psychology|location=Oxford, England|author1=Smith, P.K.|author2=Cowie, H.|author3=Blades, M.}}</ref>\n\n===Zone of proximal development===\n{{Main|Zone of proximal development}}\n[[Lev Vygotsky]] was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.<ref>Schacter, D. L., D. T. Gilbert, and D. M. Wegner. Psychology. 2. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2011.</ref>  Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the \"zone of proximal development\") could help children learn new tasks. This adult role is often referred to as the skilled \"master,\" whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed \"[[cognitive apprenticeship]]\" Martin Hill stated that \"The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child.\" This technique is called \"scaffolding,\" because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.<ref name=\"vygotsky782\">{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Vygotsky, L.S.}}</ref> Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.<ref name=\"vygotsky782\" /> In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment.<ref name=\"vygotsky20102\">{{Cite book|title=Activity Systems Analysis Methods: Understanding Complex Learning Environments|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|location=New York, NY|author=Yamagata-Lynch, L.C}}</ref> He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.<ref name=\"vygotsky20102\" />\n\n===Constructivism===\n{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}\nConstructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.  Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.  Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.<ref name=\"Edpsych24\"/>\n\nJean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viking.coe.uh.edu/~ichen/ebook/et-it/cognitiv.htm|title=Overview of Cognitive Constructivism|website=Cognitive Constructivist Theories}}</ref>\n\n===Evolutionary developmental psychology===\n{{Main|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}\n\nEvolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition.

A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual. Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity. Later [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed the [[Mary Ainsworth#Strange Situation|Strange Situation]] protocol and the concept of the secure base.\n\nTheorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:<ref name=\"Schacter4402\">{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}</ref> secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,<ref name=\"Adolescence3\"/> and disorganized.<ref name=\"Schacter4402\" /> Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver. This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.<ref name=\"Adolescence3\" /> Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.<ref name=\"Schacter4402\" />\n\nA child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments. Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect. The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development. Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploring Psychology|last=Myers|first=D.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-57259-096-3}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Level Psychology Through Diagrams|last=Hill|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-918094-6}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAttachment style can affect the relationships between people. Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood. An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs. An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}</ref>\n\n==Major debates==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Nature vs nurture===\nA significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as \"[[nature and nurture]]\" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].\n\nAn empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].\n\nOne area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].\n\nThe nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.<ref name=\"Schlinger\">{{Cite book |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}</ref> But Skinner's conception of \"Verbal Behavior\" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.<ref name=\"Schlinger\" />\n\n===Continuity vs discontinuity===\nSince theorists believe that development is a smooth, continuous process, individuals gradually add more of the same types of skills throughout their lives. Other theorists, however, think that development takes place in discontinuous stages. People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. With each new step, the person shows interest and responds to the world qualitatively.\n\n===Stability vs change===\nThis issue involves the degree to which we become older renditions of our early experience or whether we develop into something different from who we were at an earlier point in development. It considers the extent to which early experiences ( especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development.\n\nMost lifespan developmentalists, recognise that extreme positions are unwise. Therefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the \u00b7interaction of different factors and not only one.\n\n==Mechanisms of Development==\nDevelopmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are sometimes [[computer model|computational]], but they do not need to be.\n\nA model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[human brain|brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbol]]ic, [[connectionist]] ([[neural net]]work), or [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] models to explain the Mechanisms of Development.\n\n==Research areas==\n\n===Cognitive development===\n{{Main|Cognitive development|Theory of cognitive development|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}\nCognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and language. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.\n\nOther accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.\n\n[[K. Warner Schaie]] has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.  Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.<ref>Schaie, K. W. (1990). Intellectual development in adulthood. In J. E. Birren & K. W. Schaie (Eds.), Handbook of the psychology of aging, 3rd ed., (pp. 291-309). New York: Academic Press</ref>\n\nModern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of [[cognitive psychology]] and the psychology of [[individual differences]] into the interpretation and modeling of development.<ref name=\"demetriou\">Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179\u2013269). London: Wiley.</ref> Specifically, [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level. However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.\n\n===Social and emotional development===\n{{Main|Social psychology}}\nDevelopmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.\n\n[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state. Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.<ref>Amanda Morris et al. (2009) National Institute of Health. \"The Role of the Family Context in Development of Emotion Regulation.\" pp 1-36 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012</ref>\n\nMusic also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.<ref>Oaklander, Violet.

Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.<ref name=\"Eaton\">Eaton, Warren. \"Physical Maturation\", University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Retrieved on 2012-03-16.</ref> Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed. Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.<ref name=\"Eaton\" />\n\nA few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers. A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers.<ref name=\"Eaton\" />\n\n===Memory development===\nResearchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward. According to [[Fuzzy-trace theory]], we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist. These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace. Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age.

However, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.\n\nDevelopmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including [[naturalistic observation]] or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or [[structured interviews]]; clinical or [[case study]] method; and [[ethnography]] or participant observation.<ref name=Berk>{{cite book |title=Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood |author=Laura E.

This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.<ref>[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers], Dr John Worthington, 2001</ref>\n\nResearchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data. Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations. Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|40}}\n\nIn a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]]. By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|41}}\n\nA third study design, the [[cohort study|sequential design]], combines both methodologies. Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|42}}\n\nBecause every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible.<ref name=Prentice-Hall />\n\n==Life stages of psychological development==\n<!--THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK!-->\n{{See also|Child development stages}}\n\n===Prenatal development===\n{{Main|Prenatal development}}\n{{See also|Fetal psychology}}\nPrenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development. The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby.<ref>{{citation|first=K|last=Cherry|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/prenataldevelop.htm|title=Stages of Prenatal Development|website=About Psychology}}</ref>{{better source|date=May 2016}} The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age). The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).<ref name=Berk />{{rp|97}} Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|100}} Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|101}}\n\nSome [[primitive reflexes]] too arise before birth and are still present in newborns. One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development. For example, the [[tonic neck reflex]] may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.<ref name=\"butterworth\">{{Cite book |last=Butterworth |first=G. |author2=Harris, M. |title=Principles of Developmental Psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-86377-280-3}}</ref>\n\nOther reflexes, such as the [[walking reflex]] appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy. This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.<ref name=\"bremner\">{{Cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}</ref> It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the [[moro reflex|moro]] and [[walking reflex]]es) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.<ref name=\"butterworth\" />  Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like [[dementia]] or traumatic lesions.\n\n[[Ultrasound]] has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.<ref name=\"bremner\" /> By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.<ref name=\"bremner\" /> Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in [[schizophrenia]]. With the advent of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[embryology]] and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.\n\nSeveral environmental agents\u2014[[teratogens]]\u2014can cause damage during the prenatal period. These include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the [[rubella]] virus and the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|102\u2013115}} There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances. A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basis. This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant. 'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood. The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.<ref>{{Cite news|title=One of five expectant mothers use cocaine, U.S. study finds|author=AP|work=Toronto star\n|issn=0319-0781|date=1989-01-20}}</ref>\n\n===Infancy===\n{{Main|Infant and child psychology|Infant cognitive development}}\nFrom birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an [[infant]].<ref name=Berk /> Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clear.\n\nThe majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep. At first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become [[diurnal animal|diurnal]].\n\nInfants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:\n* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)\n* quiet waking, and active waking\n* fussing and [[crying]]\n\n====Infant perception====\nInfant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.  These five features are better known as one's \"five senses\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Bee |first=Denise Boyd, Helen |title=The developing child |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-205-25602-0 |page=36 |edition=13th}}</ref> Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.<ref name=\"bremner\" />\n\n* [[Visual perception|Vision]] is significantly worse in infants than in older children. Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time. Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.<ref name=\"butterworth\" /> Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.<ref name=\"Berk\" />{{rp|191}}\n* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languages. Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.<ref name=\"Berk\" />{{rp|151}} Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult's.\n* [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[taste]] are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.<ref name=\"Berk\" />{{rp|150}} There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.<ref name=\"butterworth\" />\n* [[Haptic perception|Touch and feel]] is one of the better-developed senses at birth considering it's one of the first senses to develop inside the womb.<ref>{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Ruth Duskin |last2=Papalia |first2=Diane E. |title=A child's world: infancy through adolescence |year=2010 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353204-2 |page=57 |edition=12th}}</ref>  This is evidenced by the [[primitive reflexes]] described above, and the relatively advanced development of the [[somatosensory cortex]].<ref name=\"Slater\">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Infant Development |last1=Slater |first1=A. |last2=Lewis |first2=M. |isbn=0-19-928305-2 |publisher=OUP |location=Oxford |year=2006}}</ref>\n* [[Pain]]: Infants feel pain similarly, if not more strongly than older children but pain-relief in infants has not received so much attention as an area of research.<ref name=\"MatthewMatthew\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pmj.79.934.438 |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |year=2003 |volume=79 |issue=934 |pages=438\u201343 |title=Assessment and management of pain in infants |last=Mathew |first=P.J. |last2=Mathew |first2=J.L. |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/79/934/438 |pmid=12954954 |pmc=1742785}}</ref> Glucose is known to relieve pain in newborns.<ref name=\"DilenElseviers\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.2010.00389.x |journal=Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) |year=2010 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=98\u2013105 |title=Oral glucose solution as pain relief in newborns: results of a clinical trial |last1=Dilen |first1=Ben |last2=Elseviers |first2=Monique |pmid=20557532}}</ref>\n\n====Language====\n{{Main|Language development}}\nBabies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language.

Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the \"[[A-not-B error]].\" Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone (\"Out of sight, out of mind\").\n\n====Recent findings in infant cognition====\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.\n\nBased on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.\n\nOther research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:\n\n* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wynn |first1=Karen |authorlink1=Karen Wynn |year=1992  |title=Addition and subtraction by human infants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=358 |issue= 6389|pages=749\u2013750 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/358749a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6389/abs/358749a0.html |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | url = | journal = Cognition | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1\u201334| doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4  | last1 = Woodward | first1 = A}}</ref>\n* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Keeble | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality?| url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 265\u2013288 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 }}</ref>\n\n====Critical periods of development====\nThere are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.<ref name=\"Siegler\">{{Cite book |last=Siegler |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit & Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-6113-0}}</ref> [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood.

However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that 30\u201350% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder. Studies that include comparison samples of children with typical development (TD) highlight the considerable difference in risk for psychopathology, with the relative risk for youth with DD (to youth with TD) ranging from 2.8\u20134.1 to 1.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Toddler-hood===\n{{Main|Toddler}}\nInfants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood. In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imagination.\n\nDuring toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to [[Walking|walk]], talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.<ref name=Upton>{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=62}}</ref> Self-control also begins to develop.

Accessed October 15, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Adolescence===\n{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}\nAdolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIt is divided into three parts, namely:\n# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years \n# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and\n# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years\n\nThe adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as \"Who am I? Who do I want to be?\" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.\n\n===Early adulthood===\n{{Main|Young adult (psychology)}}\nEarly adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 25, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on [[Interpersonal relationship|maintaining relationships]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kastenbaum|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Adult Development|year=1993|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=0-89774-669-4|page=14}}</ref>  Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family. Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.\n\nA related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development. Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation.<ref name=Twenge>{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Review of emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=2008|volume=121|issue=4|pages=682\u2013687}}</ref>\n\n===Middle adulthood===\n{{Main|Middle age}}\nMiddle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation. They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness.\n\nPhysically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience [[menopause]] and a sharp drop in the hormone [[estrogen]]. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. [[Andropause]] in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in [[spermatozoa|sperm]] count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in [[erection]] and longer periods of [[penile stimulation]] required to achieve [[ejaculation]].\n\n===Old age===\n{{Main|Old age}}\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] finds \"no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old.\" Most [[Developed country|\"developed countries\"]] set the age as 60 or 65. However, in [[Developing country|developing countries]] inability to make \"active contribution\" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.<ref>\"Definition of an older or elderly person\" on World Health Organization website at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/. Accessed October 11, 2015.</ref> According to [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives. In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.<ref name=\"Miller2003\">{{cite book|author=Julia R.

Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.  Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.<ref name=\"aredos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy.

Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3051-0}}</ref> Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands, accommodated by an enzyme known as helicase, results in [[replication fork]]s growing bi-directionally from the origin. A number of [[protein]]s are associated with the replication fork to help in the [[initiation]] and [[continuation]] of [[DNA synthesis]]. Most prominently, [[DNA polymerase]] synthesizes the new strands by adding [[nucleotide]]s that complement each (template) strand. DNA  replication occurs during the S-stage of [[interphase]].\n\nDNA replication (DNA amplification) can also be performed ''[[in vitro]]'' (artificially, outside a cell). DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers can be used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[ligase chain reaction]] (LCR), and [[transcription-mediated amplification]] (TMA) are examples. \n\n==DNA structure==\nDNA exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic [[double-helix]]. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of [[nucleotide]]s. Nucleotides in DNA contain a [[deoxyribose]] sugar, a [[phosphate]], and a [[nucleobase]]. The four types of [[nucleotide]] correspond to the four [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]], commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are [[purine]] bases, while cytosine and thymine are [[pyrimidine]]s. These nucleotides form [[phosphodiester bonds]], creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nucleobases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleobases are matched between strands through [[hydrogen bonding|hydrogen bonds]] to form [[base pair]]s. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds).\n\n[[Directionality (molecular biology)|DNA strands have a directionality]], and the different ends of a single strand are called the \"3' (three-prime) end\" and the \"5' (five-prime) end\". By convention, if the base sequence of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5' end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3' end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.\n\nThe pairing of complementary bases in DNA (through [[hydrogen bonding]]) means that the information contained within each strand is useless. phosphoodiester (intra-strand) bonds are stronger than hydrogen (inter-strand) bonds.  This allows the strands to be separated from one another.  The nucleotides on a single strand can therefore  be used to reconstruct nucleotides on a newly synthesized partner strand.<ref>Alberts, B., et al., ''Molecular Biology of the Cell,'' Garland Science, 4th ed., 2002, pp. 238\u2013240 {{ISBN|0-8153-3218-1}}</ref>\n\n==DNA polymerase==\n{{Main article|DNA polymerase}}\n\n[[Image:DNA polymerase.svg|thumb|250px|right| DNA polymerases adds nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand of DNA.<ref>Allison, Lizabeth A.

To begin synthesis, a short fragment of RNA, called a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]], must be created and paired with the template DNA strand.\n\nDNA polymerase adds a new strand of DNA by extending the 3' end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new [[nucleotide]]s matched to the template strand one at a time via the creation of [[phosphodiester bond]]s. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the [[high-energy phosphate]] (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated [[nucleotide|base]].  Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called [[nucleotide]]s; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a [[pyrophosphate]]. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.<ref group=Note>The [[energetics]] of this process may also help explain the directionality of synthesis\u2014if DNA were synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction, the energy for the process would come from the 5' end of the growing strand rather than from free nucleotides. The problem is that if the high energy triphosphates were on the growing strand and not on the free nucleotides, proof-reading by removing a mismatched terminal nucleotide would be problematic: Once a nucleotide is added, the triphosphate is lost and a single phosphate remains on the backbone between the new nucleotide and the rest of the strand. If the added nucleotide were mismatched, removal would result in a DNA strand terminated by a monophosphate at the end of the \"growing strand\" rather than a high energy triphosphate. So strand would be stuck and wouldn't be able to grow anymore. In actuality, the high energy triphosphates hydrolyzed at each step originate from the free nucleotides, not the polymerized strand, so this issue does not exist.</ref>\n\nIn general, DNA polymerases are highly accurate, with an intrinsic error rate of less than one mistake for every 10<sup>7</sup> nucleotides added.<ref name=\"pmid18166979\">{{cite journal|last1=McCulloch|first1=Scott D|last2=Kunkel|first2=Thomas A|title=The fidelity of DNA synthesis by eukaryotic replicative and translesion synthesis polymerases|journal=Cell Research|date=January 2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=148\u2013161|doi=10.1038/cr.2008.4|pmid=18166979|pmc=3639319}}</ref>  In addition, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases.

General Features of Chromosomal Replication: Three Common Features of Replication Origins]</ref>  Once the origin has been located, these initiators recruit other proteins and form the [[pre-replication complex]], which unwinds the double-stranded DNA.\n\n===Elongation===\nDNA polymerase has 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 activity.\nAll known DNA replication systems require a free 3' [[hydroxyl]] group before synthesis can be initiated (note: the DNA template is read in 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction whereas a new strand is synthesized in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction\u2014this is often confused). Four distinct mechanisms for DNA synthesis are recognized:\n#All cellular life forms and many DNA [[virus]]es, [[phage]]s and [[plasmid]]s use a [[primase]] to synthesize a short RNA primer with a free 3\u2032 OH group which is subsequently elongated by a DNA polymerase.  \n#The retroelements (including [[retrovirus]]es) employ a transfer RNA that primes DNA replication by providing a free 3\u2032 OH that is used for elongation by the [[reverse transcriptase]]. \n#In the [[adenovirus]]es and the \u03c629 family of [[bacteriophage]]s, the 3' OH group is provided by the side chain of an amino acid of the genome attached protein (the terminal protein) to which nucleotides are added by the DNA polymerase to form a new strand.  \n#In the single stranded DNA viruses\u2014a group that includes the [[circovirus]]es, the [[geminivirus]]es, the [[parvovirus]]es and others\u2014and also the many phages and [[plasmid]]s that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) or one of the DNA strands (plasmids). The 5\u2032 end of the nicked strand is transferred to a [[tyrosine]] residue on the nuclease and the free 3\u2032 OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand.\n\nThe first is the best known of these mechanisms and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, [[primase]] adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high [[processivity]], while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming [[Okazaki fragments]]. [[RNase]] removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. [[Ligase]] works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.\n\nThe primase used in this process differs significantly between [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]/[[eukaryote]]s. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the [[DnaG]] protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1093/nar/26.18.4205 \n| last1 = Aravind | first1 = L. \n| last2 = Leipe | first2 = D.

This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families that are involved in DNA replication and repair.

It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, [[Pol I|DNA Pol I]] is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 [[exonuclease]] activity in addition to its polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called [[nick translation]]. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.\n\nIn [[eukaryote]]s, the low-processivity enzyme, Pol \u03b1, helps to initiate replication because it forms a complex with primase.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Elizabeth R.|last2=Bell|first2=Stephen D.|title=DNA Replication in the Archaea|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|date=8 December 2006|volume=70|issue=4|pages=876\u2013887|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00029-06|pmid=17158702|pmc=1698513}}</ref>  In eukaryotes, leading strand synthesis is thought to be conducted by Pol \u03b5; however, this view has recently been  challenged, suggesting a role for Pol \u03b4.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stillman|first1=Bruce|title=Reconsidering DNA Polymerases at the Replication Fork in Eukaryotes|journal=Molecular Cell|date=July 2015|volume=59|issue=2|pages=139\u2013141|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.004|pmid=26186286|pmc=4636199}}</ref>  Primer removal is completed Pol \u03b4<ref>[http://hdl.handle.net/1802/6537 Distinguishing the pathways of primer removal during Eukaryotic Okazaki fragment maturation] Contributor Author Rossi, Marie Louise.

It is created by helicases, which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together. The resulting structure has two branching \"prongs\", each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template.\n\n'''DNA is always synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.''' Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, a major issue is how to achieve synthesis of nascent (new) lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork.\n\n====Leading strand====\nThe leading strand is the strand of nascent DNA which is being synthesized in the same direction as the growing replication fork. This sort of DNA replication is continuous.\n\n====Lagging strand====\nThe lagging strand is the strand of nascent DNA whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. Because of its orientation, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated as compared to that of the leading strand.  As a consequence, the DNA polymerase on this  strand is seen to \"lag behind\" the other strand.\n\nThe lagging strand is synthesized in short, separated segments. On the lagging strand ''template'', a [[primase]] \"reads\" the template DNA and initiates synthesis of a short complementary [[RNA]] primer. A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments, forming [[Okazaki fragment]]s. The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments of DNA are joined together by [[DNA ligase]].\n\n====Dynamics at the replication fork====\n[[Image:1axc tricolor.png|thumb|200px|The assembled human DNA clamp, a [[trimer (biochemistry)|trimer]] of the protein [[PCNA]].]]\nAs helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork, the DNA ahead is forced to rotate.

Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In most of the bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called '''[[replisome]]s''' or '''DNA replicase systems'''. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.\n\nSince replication machineries do not move relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a '''replication factory'''.<ref name=\"watson237\">James D. Watson et al. (2008), \"Molecular Biology of the gene\", Pearson Education: 237</ref> In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated for the remainder of replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in [[budding yeast]] by monitoring [[green fluorescent protein]](GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases \u03b1. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time.<ref name=\"in&out\">Peter Meister, Angela Taddei1, Susan M. Gasser(June 2006), \"In and out of the Replication Factory\", ''Cell'' '''125''' (7): 1233\u20131235</ref> This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and nascent DNAs. Meister\u2019s finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis.<ref name=\"watson237\"/>\n\nThe replication factories perform disentanglement of sister chromatids. The disentanglement is essential for distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA replication. Because sister chromatids after DNA replication hold each other by '''[[Cohesin]]''' rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA replication. Fixing of replication machineries as replication factories can improve the success rate of DNA replication. If replication forks move freely in chromosomes, catenation of nuclei is aggravated and impedes mitotic segregation.<ref name=\"in&out\"/>\n\n===Termination ===\nEukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome.  Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the very end of the chromosomes.  Due to this problem, DNA is lost each replication cycle from the end of the chromosome.  [[Telomeres]] are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in [[somatic cell]]s.  This shortens the telomeres of the daughter DNA chromosome.  As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]].)  Within the [[germ cell]] line, which passes DNA to the next generation, [[telomerase]] extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to [[cancer]] formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.\n\nTermination requires that the progress of the DNA replication fork must stop or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or [[Ter protein]].\n\nBecause bacteria have circular chromosomes, termination of replication occurs when the two replication forks meet each other on the opposite end of the parental chromosome. ''E. coli'' regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the [[Tus protein]], enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.<ref>{{cite book| author= TA Brown| title=Genomes| year=2002| publisher=[[BIOS Scientific Publishers]]| isbn=1-85996-228-9}}[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.8121#8156 13.2.3.

As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication takes place during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by [[cell cycle checkpoint]]s. Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including [[cyclin]]s and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3214#3215 Intracellular Control of Cell-Cycle Events: S-Phase Cyclin-Cdk Complexes (S-Cdks) Initiate DNA Replication Once Per Cycle]</ref> Unlike bacteria, eukaryotic DNA replicates in the confines of the nucleus.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Genomes|last = Brown|first = TA|publisher = Wiley-Liss|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = |edition = 2nd|chapter = 13|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21113/}}</ref>\n\nThe G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA.\n\nReplication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs independently of the cell cycle, through the process of [[D-loop replication]].\n\n==== Replication focus ====\nIn vertebrate cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called '''replication foci'''.<ref name=\"in&out\"/> Replication sites can be detected by immunostaining daughter strands and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors. By these methods it is found that replication foci of varying size and positions appear in S phase of cell division and their number per nucleus is far smaller than the number of genomic replication forks.\n\nP. Heun et al.(2001) tracked GFP-tagged replication foci in budding yeast cells and revealed that replication origins move constantly in G1 and S phase and the [[Molecular dynamics|dynamics]] decreased significantly in S phase.<ref name=\"in&out\"/> Traditionally, replication sites were fixed on spatial structure of chromosomes by [[nuclear matrix]] or [[lamin]]s. The Heun\u2019s results denied the traditional concepts, budding yeasts don't have lamins, and support that replication origins self-assemble and form replication foci.\n\nBy firing of replication origins, controlled spatially and temporally, the formation of replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells.<ref name=\"in&out\"/> Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings '''clustering''' of replication forks. The clustering do '''rescue of stalled replication forks''' and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate from each other and cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of '''dormant replication origins''' that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.\n\n===Bacteria===\n[[File:Hemimethylation.svg|thumb|200px|Dam methylates adenine of GATC sites after replication.]]\nMost bacteria do not go through a well-defined cell cycle but instead continuously copy their DNA; during rapid growth, this can result in the concurrent occurrence of multiple rounds of replication.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Obligate Human Pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Is Polyploid|vauthors=Tobiason DM, Seifert HS | journal=PLoS Biology| year=2006| volume=4| issue=6| doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040185| pages=e185| pmid=16719561| pmc=1470461}} {{open access}}</ref>  In ''E. coli'', the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of [[Adenosine triphosphate|adenosine triphosphate (ATP)]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|adenosine diphosphate (ADP)]], and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences.\n\nBecause ''E. coli'' [[DNA methylation|methylates]] GATC DNA sequences, DNA synthesis results in hemimethylated sequences. This hemimethylated DNA is recognized by the protein [[SeqA protein domain|SeqA]], which binds and sequesters the origin sequence; in addition, DnaA (required for initiation of replication) binds less well to hemimethylated DNA. As a result, newly replicated origins are prevented from immediately initiating another round of DNA replication.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Slater|first1=Steven|last2=Wold|first2=Sture|last3=Lu|first3=Min|last4=Boye|first4=Erik|last5=Skarstad|first5=Kirsten|last6=Kleckner|first6=Nancy|title=E. coli SeqA protein binds oriC in two different methyl-modulated reactions appropriate to its roles in DNA replication initiation and origin sequestration|journal=Cell|date=September 1995|volume=82|issue=6|pages=927\u2013936|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90272-4|pmid=7553853}}<!--|accessdate=7 April 2016--></ref>\n\nATP builds up when the cell is in a rich medium, triggering DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size.

A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication \u2014 each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication.\n\n{{see also|Plasmid|Plasmid copy number|Plasmid partition system}}\n\n==Polymerase chain reaction==\n{{Main article|Polymerase chain reaction}}\nResearchers commonly replicate DNA ''in vitro'' using the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR uses a pair of [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a thermostable [[DNA polymerase]]. Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At the start of each cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, [[exponential growth|increasing exponentially]].<ref name=\"Saiki2\">{{cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=Randall|last2=Gelfand|first2=David H.|last3=Stoffel|first3=Susanne|last4=Scharf|first4=Stephen J.|last5=Higuchi|first5=Russell|last6=Horn|first6=Glenn T.|last7=Mullis|first7=Kary B.|last8=Erlich|first8=Henry A.|title=Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase|journal=Science|date=29 January 1988|volume=239|issue=4839|pages=487\u2013491|doi=10.1126/science.2448875|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/239/4839/487.long|accessdate=7 April 2016|pmid=2448875|bibcode=1988Sci...239..487S}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|DNA replication}}\n{{wikiversity|DNA#DNA_Replication}}\n* [[Autopoiesis]]\n* [[Data storage device]]\n* [[Self-replication]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DNA replication}}\n{{Portal bar|Molecular and cellular biology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dna Replication}}\n[[Category:DNA replication| ]]\n[[Category:Senescence]]", "sha1": "lz3pxrsuk3vpzpidzt1doad07rn3156"}}, {"title": "Dravidian", "ns": "0", "id": "9016", "revision": {"id": "828808210", "parentid": "828808094", "timestamp": "2018-03-04T21:51:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bmclaughlin9", "id": "9887272"}, "comment": "/* Language and culture */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary}}\n'''Dravidian''' or '''Dravida''' may refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Language and culture==\n*[[Dravidian languages]], a family of languages spoken mainly in South India and northeastern Sri Lanka\n*[[Dravidian people]], those whose native languages are Dravidian languages\n*[[Proto-Dravidian language]], a model of the common ancestor of the Dravidian languages\n*[[Dravidian University]], a university situated in Andhra Pradesh\n*[[Dravidian Linguistics Association]], based in Kerala\n*[[South Indian culture]], modern Dravidian culture\n*[[Dravidian architecture]], a style of temple construction\n*[[Dravidian martial arts]], a style of martial arts\n\n==Geography==\n*[[Dravida Nadu]], a proposed country for the southern Dravidian languages\n*[[South India]], the region which is called Dravida in the Indian anthem\n\n==Ethnicity==\n*[[Dravidian peoples]], ethnic groups primarily in South India.\n*[[Homo Dravida]], a historically defined race, propagated also by Devaneya Pavanar\n*[[Adi Dravida]], natives of Southern India\n*[[Dravidology]], a field of study\n* Pancha Dravida Brahmins, a division of Indian [[Brahmin]]s\n\n==Religion==\n*[[Dravidian folk religion]]\n\n==Politics==\n*[[Dravidian parties]], a collective term used for political parties, that trace their ideologies and origin from Dravidar Kazhagam\n*[[Dravidar Kazhagam]], a former political party in Tamil Nadu\n*[[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], a political party in Tamil Nadu\n*[[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], a political party in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu\n*[[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], a political party in Tamil Nadu\n*[[Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam]], a political party in Tamil Nadu\n*[[All India Latchiya Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], a political party in Tamil Nadu\n*[[Self-respect movement]], sometimes called the Dravidian movement or the Periyar movement\n\n==Others==\n*[[Dravidan (1989 film)]], a 1989 Tamil film\n*[[Dravidan (1998 film)]], Indian Malayalam film released in 1998\n*[[Dravida Sangha]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dravid (surname)]]\n* [[Davidian (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "bygnxb33juif5shuzd59vgnghirbhhn"}}, {"title": "Daisy Duck", "ns": "0", "id": "9020", "revision": {"id": "866036500", "parentid": "866017797", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T21:17:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pyy", "id": "24886636"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866017797 by [[Special:Contributions/Dimadick|Dimadick]] ([[User talk:Dimadick|talk]]) yes, really. adress it on talk page if you want you wanna discuss it", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour   = #CCCCFF\n| name     = Daisy Duck\n| fullname= Daisy Duck\n| nickname   = \n| alias     = Super Daisy ({{lang-it|Paperinika}})\n| image     = DaisyDuck.png\n| caption    = \n| first     = ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940)\n| last       = \n| creator    = [[Carl Barks]]\n| voice     = <!-- To avoid clutter, this list is limited to people who voiced Daisy more than one time.

Like Donald, Daisy is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[American Pekin duck|white duck]], but has large eyelashes and ruffled tail feathers to suggest a skirt. She is often seen wearing a hair bow, blouse, and heeled shoes. Daisy usually shows a strong affinity towards Donald, although she is often characterized as being more sophisticated than him.\n\nDaisy was introduced in the short film ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940) and was incorporated into Donald's [[Donald Duck in comics|comic stories]] several months later. She appeared in 11 short films between 1940 and 1954, and far later in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983) and ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' (1999). In these roles, Daisy was always a supporting character, with the exception of ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]'' (1947). Daisy has received considerably more screen time in television, making regular appearances in ''[[Quack Pack]]'' (1996), ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (1999-2000), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016). Daisy has also appeared in several [[direct-to-video]] films such as ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999) and ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|The Three Musketeers]]'' (2004).\n\nDaisy is the aunt of [[Duck family (Disney)#April, May, and June|April, May, and June]], three young girl ducks who act as [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]'s female counterparts. Daisy is a close friend of [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Mickey Mouse universe#Clara Cluck|Clara Cluck]] in the comics and [[Minnie Mouse]]'s best friend.<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1999/daisyvisitsminnie.html Daisy Visits Minnie].

Retrieved on March 17, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\nSince her early appearances, Daisy is attracted to Donald and is devoted to him. This is most clearly seen in ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]'' as Daisy is almost to the point of suicide after Donald forgets her. Despite this, she's shown to have her boyfriend wrapped around her finger and is often shown to keep him in line whenever his anger starts to boil.\n\nBesides her love for Donald, Daisy is also shown to be more sophisticated and intelligent than him. In ''[[Cured Duck]]'' Daisy even gives Donald an ultimatum regarding his temper but later reforms in ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]''. Daisy herself sometimes exhibits a temper, but she has much greater self-control than Donald.\n\nIn the ''Mouse Works''/''House of Mouse'' cartoons, she was sometimes portrayed as intrusive and overly talkative. She would invite herself in without asking and would tag along on trips where she was not wanted.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nDaisy is a white duck with an orange bill and legs. She usually has indigo eyeshadow, long distinct eyelashes and ruffled feathers around her lowest region to suggest a skirt.\n\nShe's usually seen sporting a blouse with puffed short sleeves and a v-neckline. She also wears a matching bow, heeled shoes and a single bangle on her wrist. The colors of her clothes change very often, but her signature colors are usually purple and pink.\n\nThe television series Quack Pack gave Daisy Duck a more mature wardrobe and hairstyle and cast her as a career woman with a television reporter job. House of Mouse got her a blue and purple employee uniform, with a blue bow, and a long ponytail. In Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Daisy regained her purple blouse with a purple bow and shoes. She also wears a gold bangle and has a short ponytail, similar to the longer one seen in House of Mouse.<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/television/houseofmouseepisode101.html Disney's House of Mouse].

Retrieved on March 17, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Voice==\nDaisy Duck has been voiced by several different voice actors over the years, yet by far the most extensive work has been done by [[Tress MacNeille]], who took on the role in 1999.\n\n[[Clarence Nash]], who provided Donald's voice, voiced Daisy in her debut in ''Mr. Duck Steps Out'' with a \"[[Donald Duck talk|duck voice]]\" similar to Donald's but pitched higher. For Daisy's second appearance [[Gloria Blondell]] took over, marking the debut of Daisy's \"normal\" voices. Blondell voiced Daisy for six of her nine speaking appearances during the classic shorts era. Daisy's third voice was [[Ruth Clifford]], who voiced her once in ''Donald's Dream Voice'' (1948). After Blondell returned for one more performance, [[Vivi Janiss]] voiced Daisy (and also her mother) in her final classic cartoon, ''Donald's Diary'' (1954). In 1983 Daisy was voiced by [[Patricia Parris]] in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. Daisy was then voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], in ''Down and Out with Donald Duck'' (1987) and then throughout her first regular television series ''[[Quack Pack]]'' (1996). In 1998 Daisy was voiced by [[Diane Michelle]] in the anthology film ''[[The Spirit of Mickey]]''. Also in ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999) along with Tress MacNeille. In 1999 Tress MacNeille took over as Daisy's full-time voice. MacNeille has voiced Daisy in the television series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. MacNeille has also voiced Daisy in television specials and movies. Daisy was also voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' although she had no lines; just a scream.\n\n==Donna Duck==\nAccording to some sources{{who?|date=September 2018}}, Daisy was introduced in 1937 as Donna Duck, yet there is conflicting evidence as to whether Donna was an early version of Daisy or a separate character entirely. Walt Disney Company released a collector's pin in 1999 which reads, \"Daisy Duck debuts as Donna Duck 1937.\"\n\nDonna made her sole animated appearance in the short film ''[[Don Donald]]'' (1937), directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]]. It was the first installment of the ''Donald Duck'' film series and was also the first time Donald was shown with a love interest. In the story, Donald travels to Mexico to court a duck who is largely a female version of himself. She is portrayed with the same feisty temperament and impatience and was even voiced by Donald's voice actor [[Clarence Nash]]. At the end of the story she spitefully abandons Donald in the desert after his car breaks down.\n\nSome sources{{who?|date=September 2018}}} consider ''Don Donald'' Daisy's debut.

These are, in order of release, ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940), ''[[Donald's Crime]]'' (1945), ''[[Cured Duck]]'' (1945), ''[[Donald's Double Trouble]]'' (1946), ''[[Dumb Bell of the Yukon]]'', ''[[Sleepy Time Donald]]'' (1947), ''[[Donald's Dilemma]]'', ''[[Donald's Dream Voice]]'' (1948), ''[[Crazy Over Daisy]]'' (1950), ''[[Donald's Diary]]'' (1954) & ''[[How to Have an Accident at Work]]''(1959) as Donald's unnamed wife. She also made a brief cameo in the ''Mickey Mouse'' short film ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'' (1941). After the classic shorts era, Daisy appeared in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983) and ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' (1999) with another cameo in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988).\n\n===First appearance===\n[[File:Daisy Duck first appearance.png|thumb|right|Daisy makes her entrance in ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940).]]\nDaisy Duck in her familiar name and design first appeared in ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (June 7, 1940). The short was directed by [[Jack King (animator)|Jack King]] and scripted by [[Carl Barks]]. There Donald visits the house of his new romantic interest for their first known date. At first, Daisy acts shy and has her back turned to her visitor. But Donald soon notices her tail-feathers taking the form of a hand and signaling for him to come closer. But their time alone is soon interrupted by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] who have followed their uncle and clearly compete with him for the attention of Daisy. Uncle and nephews take turns dancing the [[jitterbug]] with her while trying to get rid of each other. In their final effort, the three younger Ducks feed their uncle [[maize]] (corn) in the process of becoming [[popcorn]]. The process is completed within Donald himself who continues to move spastically around the house while maintaining the appearance of dancing. The short ends with an impressed Daisy showering her new boyfriend with kisses. Like her precursor, she was initially voiced by Clarence Nash, but later had a more ladylike voice.\n\nThe short stands out among other Donald shorts of the period for its use of modern music and surreal situations throughout.\n\n===Disney shorts: 1941&ndash;1947===\nOne year following her introduction in ''Mr. Duck Steps Out'', Daisy, along with Donald and the nephews, made a brief cameo in the ''Mickey Mouse'' short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'', cementing her position as a recurring character.\n\nDaisy's second speaking role came four years later in ''[[Donald's Crime]]''. While Daisy has a relatively small role in the film, her date with Donald is central to the plot and shows Donald's infatuation for her. Finding himself broke before the date; Donald steals money from his nephews, but afterward feels guilty. Donald imagines what Daisy might think of him knowing he stole money, and this leads him to reform in the end. Daisy was voiced in the film by actress [[Gloria Blondell]], marking the first time Daisy had a \"normal\" voice as opposed to a duck voice like Donald's. The film also marked the first time Daisy appeared in an Academy Award nominated film ([[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short]]).\n\nLater that same year Daisy appeared again in ''[[Cured Duck]]'' (October 26, 1945).<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1945/curedduck.html Cured Duck].

Retrieved on March 17, 2008.</ref> The short starts simply enough. Donald visits Daisy at her house. She asks him to open a window. He keeps trying to pull it open and eventually goes into a [[Rage (emotion)|rage]]. By the time Daisy returns to the room, Donald has wrecked it. She demonstrates that the locking mechanism was on and criticizes his temper. She refuses to date Donald again until he learns to manage his anger. She claims Donald does not see her losing her own temper. Donald agrees to her terms and follows the surreal method of [[mail order]]ing an \"insult machine\", a device constantly hurling verbal and physical insults at him. He endures the whole process until feeling able to stay calm throughout it. He visits Daisy again and this time calmly opens the window. But when Daisy shows her boyfriend her new [[hat]], his reaction is uncontrollable laughter. Daisy goes into a rage of her own and the short ends by pointing out that Donald is not the only Duck in need of [[anger management]] training. There is a continuation regarding her temper at one episode in Mickey Mouse Works where she and Donald have a date in a restaurant wherein they both end up with a bad temper.\n\nTheir relationship problems were also focused on in ''[[Donald's Double Trouble]]'' (June 28, 1946).<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1946/donaldsdoubletrouble.html Donald's Double Trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423065725/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1946/donaldsdoubletrouble.html |date=2008-04-23 }}.

Unwilling to lose Daisy, Donald has to find an answer to the problem. But his solution involves his own [[look-alike]] who happens to have all the desired qualities. His unnamed look-alike happens to be unemployed at the moment and agrees to this plan. Donald provides the money for his dates with Daisy but soon comes to realize the look-alike serves as a rival suitor. The rest of the short focuses on his increasing [[jealousy]] and efforts to replace the look-alike during the next date. A failed attempt at a [[tunnel of love (amusement ride)|tunnel of love]] results in the two male Ducks exiting the tunnel in each other's hands by mistake. Daisy walks out completely drenched. She jumps up and down and sounds like a record played too fast as Donald and his look-alike run away.\n\nIn ''[[Dumb Bell of the Yukon]]'', Daisy is the motivation behind Donald's hunting trip after he reads a letter from her saying she likes fur coats.

He regains consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. Both his speaking and singing voices have been improved to the point of being able to enter a new career as a professional [[singer]]. He also acts more refined than usual. Most importantly Donald suffers from partial [[amnesia]] and has no memory of Daisy. Donald goes on becoming a well-known [[crooner]] and his rendition of [[When You Wish upon a Star]] becomes a hit. He is surrounded by female [[Fan (person)|fans]] in his every step. Meanwhile, Daisy cannot even approach her former lover and her loss results in a number of psychological symptoms. Various scenes feature her suffering from [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[insomnia]], and self-described [[insanity]]. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and contemplating various methods of [[suicide]]. She narrates her story to a [[psychologist]] who determines that Donald would regain his memory with another flower pot falling on his head but warns that his improved voice may also be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a [[dilemma]]. Either the world has its singer, but Daisy loses him, or Daisy regains her Donald, but the world loses him. Posed with the question \"her or the world\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream of \"Me, Me, Me\". Soon Donald has returned to his old self and has forgotten about his career.

His attempts at politeness are misinterpreted and customers react angrily to imagined insults. But Daisy convinces him otherwise \"Don't give up! I have faith in you!\" His problems seem to end when Donald buys a box of \"voice pills\", a medicine temporarily improving his voice. He gets confident enough in his new-found voice to prepare his marriage proposal for Daisy. But due to an accident he loses all but one of his pills. The rest of the short features his frustrated attempt to regain this last pill in order to propose to her. Something which he is eventually unable to do. After a few minutes of trying to get it, the pill ends up getting swallowed by a cow and makes it able to talk. And tells Donald he can't understand what he's saying.

Interrupted in the end by Daisy herself who accuses Donald of being cruel to the two \"innocent\" [[chipmunk]]s. The short ends with Donald having to forget about that date.

But after having a nightmare about the anxieties that would come from married life, Donald runs out on her and joins the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Several scenes of the short imply that Daisy has had several previous relationships with men. Donald carves their names on a tree. Not noticing than the opposing side of the tree features her name alongside that of several other boyfriends. The marriage scene in Donald's dream featured a group of [[sailor]]s waving goodbye to Daisy and mourning the loss of their apparent lover. The story bore little continuity with the \"real\" Donald and Daisy as Huey, Dewey, and Louie appeared as Daisy's younger brothers. It was the only time in which Daisy's parents are seen.\n\n===Later theatrical appearances===\n[[File:Donald and Daisy - Fantasia 2000.png|thumb|right|Daisy (right) with Donald in ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'']]\nDaisy appeared in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' in 1983, playing the character Isabelle, the neglected love interest of a young [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], played by [[Scrooge McDuck]]. The film was Daisy's first theatrical appearance in almost 30 years and was also the first time she appeared apart from Donald. Although the nature of the film was that of Disney characters \"playing\" other characters and was not part of any story continuity. Daisy was voiced by [[Patricia Parris]] in the film.\n\nIn 1988 Daisy made a cameo appearance in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' along with many other Disney characters.\n\nDaisy's most recent theatrical appearance was ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', released in late 1999. Like the original ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', the film constituted various musical segments. Donald and Daisy appeared in non-speaking roles for the seventh of eight segments, set to the [[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|''Pomp and Circumstance'' marches]]. The segment is a retelling of [[Noah's Ark]] with the ducks acting as Noah's assistants. Donald and Daisy become separated in the chaos of the flood and each presumes the other to have drowned until they discover each other afterwards.\n\n===Non-theatrical appearances===\nDaisy appeared in the direct-to-video films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'', ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'', and ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]''.\n\n==In comics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\nAccording to the unofficial timeline of [[Don Rosa]], Daisy was born in 1920. According to Rosa, Daisy is the sister of Donald's brother-in-law \u2013 Daisy's brother had married Donald's twin sister, [[Duck family (Disney)#Della Duck|Della Duck]], and together, the two became the parents of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] Duck. This is his explanation of why the triplets tend to call her \"Aunt Daisy\" while no such courtesy is given to [[Gladstone Gander]] for example. Don Rosa has said that he considers Donald and Daisy to be nonrelated and that Duck simply is the [[Duckburg]] universe equal to [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], being a common surname.\n\nDonna Duck served as a precursor for Daisy in both animation and comics. She first appeared in a one-page illustration titled \"Don Donald\" and published in ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' #3701 (January 1937). The page was illustrated by Thomas \"Tom\" Wood (1870s \u2013 October 4, 1940) who was head of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]' publicity department from 1933 until his death. She made a brief appearance in the \"Donald and Donna\" comic strip published in ''[[Mickey Mouse Weekly]]'' from May 15 to August 21, 1937. The ''Weekly'' was a [[United Kingdom]] publication and the strip was illustrated at the time by [[William Arthur Ward]].\n\nDaisy made her first comics appearance on November 4, 1940. She was introduced as the new neighbor of Donald and his potential [[Romantic interest (theater)|love interest]]. The Donald Duck comic strip was at the time scripted by [[Bob Karp]] and illustrated by [[Al Taliaferro]]. She was seemingly soft-spoken but had a fiery temper and Donald often found himself a victim to her rage. For example, one strip had Daisy waiting for Donald to carve their names and their love for each other on a tree, only to discover the male Duck had carved \"Daisy loves Donald\" with her name hardly visible and his name in prominent bold letters. Resulting in her breaking her umbrella on his head and dismissing him as a \"conceited little pup\".\n\nHer first original [[comic book]] appearance was a cameo in the story \"The Mighty Trapper\" by [[Carl Barks]], first published in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #36 (September 1943), wherein Huey, Dewey, and Louie ask her to lend them an old fur coat. Barks did not use the character again until \"Donald Tames His Temper\" (January 1946) when Daisy demands that Donald learns to manage his anger as a [[New Year's resolution]]. Donald has to agree but points early on that Daisy herself has the temper of a \"wild-eyed [[wildcat]]\".\n\nHer next appearance by Barks in \"Biceps Blues\" (June 1946) introduced a key concept to their relationship. When Daisy seems impressed by a certain type of male, Donald is forced to emulate that type, no matter how unsuited Donald is for emulating it successfully. In this early case, Daisy envies her \"old school chum\" Susy Swan for dating a notable [[Powerlifting|weightlifter]]. Donald at first protests that she seems too impressed by a \"[[gorilla]]\" just because the \"muscle-bound [[American Bison|buffalo]]\" can lift 300 pounds. But when Daisy simply ignores him and daydreams about dating [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]], Donald decides to start weightlifting. The rest of the story focuses on his ineptitude at exercising and the eventual efforts of Huey, Dewey, and Louie to cheer him up by various tricks pointing to Donald becoming stronger. But when Donald arranges a demonstration for Daisy, Susy, and her boyfriend, their tricks are not able to save him from ridicule. Daisy then chases Donald in anger (Donald, in turn, chases Huey, Dewey, and Louie in anger) while Susy boasts about her luck in men to her weightlifter boyfriend, who simply grunts and nods and fails to understand her words. Daisy failed to see that Susy's boyfriend is strong but otherwise not too gifted, whereas Donald is one who would go great lengths for her.\n\nDaisy continued to make frequent appearances in stories by Barks but the next important one for her development was \"[[Wintertime Wager]]\" (January 1948). There she first attempts to act as the voice of reason between competing cousins Donald Duck and [[Gladstone Gander]] and in fact manages to prevent Donald losing his house to Gladstone because of a wager. This story established that both of them wanted to be in her good graces. Their next joined meeting in \"Gladstone Returns\" (August 1948) has Donald and Gladstone competing in raising enough money for her charity effort.\n\nTheir rivalry increased when \"Donald's Love Letters\" (December 1949) revealed that both cousins were romantically interested in Daisy. From then on many stories by both Barks and others would develop around this [[love triangle]]. Daisy in turns dates both of them but this fact does not prevent the two competing suitors from attempting to earn more of her affection or trying to embarrass each other in front of her. Daisy can be counted on to be making regular appearances alongside either of them for several years to come. Often it would appear as if Gladstone had the upper hand in winning Daisy due to his luck, only to find fate thwarts his plans, such as a contest where the man who hunts the most turkeys gets to have dinner with Daisy, who has won a beauty contest. Gladstone wins the turkey hunt but finds himself having dinner with an ugly woman who is the runner-up queen, as Daisy is incapacitated, and Donald is the one nursing her.\n\nSimilarly, Daisy's precursor Donna and Daisy herself were featured together as rivals for Donald's affection in a newspaper strip published on August 7, 1951. In her last appearance, on August 11, 1951, Donna had a fianc\u00e9, a caricature of Disney cartoonist [[Manuel Gonzales]], establishing a distinction between her character and Daisy.\n\nIn the comics, Daisy is also a member of a local gossip group called the \"Chit-Chat Society\", which plays bridge and sponsors [[Charitable organization|charity]] fund-raisers. The core membership includes [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Clara Cluck]], though occasionally some other unnamed characters appear.\n\nIn later years, Carl Barks 'modernized' Daisy in two stories: 'The not-so-ancient mariner' and 'Hall of the mermaid queen'. In the first story, Daisy is wearing a lot of different [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] and outfits. Gladstone Gander is also seen wearing a wig and a new wardrobe in the story. In the second story, Daisy has short, curly hair and a bow that is much smaller than usual.\n\nIn the 1950s, Disney launched the series \"Daisy Duck's Diary\", where Daisy was given more of a leading role. This series, originally by such cartoonists as [[Dick Moores]], [[Jack Bradbury]], [[Tony Strobl]] and Carl Barks, have continued to the present day in Italy.\n\n[[File:Paperinika.png|thumb|right|Daisy as ''Paperinika'']]\nSince the early 1970s, Daisy has been featured as a crimefighter in [[Italy|Italian]] Disney comics. The character of \"Super Daisy\" (''\"Paperinika\"'' in Italian) was designed as a female counterpart to the \"Duck Avenger\" (''\"[[Paperinik]]\"'' in Italian). While the character of the Duck Avenger was originally created to place Donald into situations where he was finally a \"winner\" (versus his usual portrayal as a \"loser\"), when Super Daisy appeared in the same story as the Duck Avenger, she then became the \"winner\" and Donald was once more relegated to the role of \"loser.\" This upset some children, who complained to the comics' editors, which resulted in the Italian comics ceasing to use Super Daisy, though the [[Brazil]] Disney comics continue to make use of Daisy's [[superhero]] alter ego.\n\nAs Super Daisy, Daisy has no superpowers but instead uses devices created by high society fashion designer Genialina Edy Son. Genialina personally designed Daisy's costume, as well as supplying her with crime-fighting gear such as sleeping pills and a [[James Bond]]-esque sports car. Very frequently, Super Daisy will both fight alongside and against the Duck Avenger. In the Brazilian stories, Super Daisy often teams up with other Disney comic superheroes, such as \"[[Super Goof]]\" ([[Goofy]]), \"Super Gilly\" (\"Gilbert\"), the \"Red Bat\" ([[Fethry Duck]]), etc.\n\nWhile the Duck Avenger's main goal is enforcing justice in Duckburg, and proving himself better than his usual, unlucky self, Super Daisy acts mostly on an extreme, somewhat warped form of [[feminism]], donning her alternate identity to prove that women are better than men at whatever they do, openly antagonizing the Duck Avenger to prove her point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL++923-AP|title=Paperinika contro Paperinik - I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|website=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> Later stories, as the \"Hero Club\" inspired Italian story ''Ultraheroes'' show Super Daisy and the Duck Avenger at the center of a weird [[love triangle]]: Super Daisy, despite their bickering eventually warms to the Duck Avenger, feeling drawn to his righteous persona, as the Duck Avenger does.

She had one in Brazil between 1986 and 1997, and a short-lived series in 2004 with republications of old stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2004/review_margarida01.cfm|title=UNIVERSO HQ - QUADRINHOS - REVIEWS - MARGARIDA # 1<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Universohq.com|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Name in other languages==\n* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0632\u064a\u0632\u064a (Zyzy)\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] : \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0437\u0438 \u0414\u044a\u043a (De\u012dzi D\u016dk)\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: Vlatka Patka\n* [[Danish language|Danish]]: Andersine And\n* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Katrien Duck\n* [[Faroese language|Faroese]]: D\u00fanhild Dunna\n* [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Iines Ankka\n* [[Greek language|Greek]]: \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b6\u03b7 \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba (Nta\u00edzi Ntak)\n* [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05d6\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d0\u05e7 (Dyyzy Daq)\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Deszi Kacsa\n* [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Desi Bebek\n* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: Andr\u00e9s\u00edna \u00d6nd\n* [[Italian language|Italian]]: Paperina\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: \u30c7\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af (Deij\u012b Dakku)\n* [[Korean language|Korean]]: \ub370\uc774\uc9c0 \ub355 (deiji deog)\n* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: Dolly Duck\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]: Kaczka Daisy\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Margarida\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0437\u0438 \u0414\u0430\u043a (Deyzi Dak)\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: Pata Daisy\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Kajsa Anka\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Deyzi\n* [[Chinese language|Traditional Chinese]] : \u9edb\u7d72 / \u9edb\u897f\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Pata Patka\n\n==At the Disney parks==\n\nAt the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] and on the [[Disney Cruise Line]] ships, Daisy is a semi-common character for meet-and-greets, parades, and shows, though she doesn't make as many appearances as Donald or Minnie. Her semi-elusiveness has made her extra popular to an extent, adding to the fact that Daisy is a member of the Sensational Six, therefore making Daisy merchandise even more appealing to collectors. After Disney World expanded Fantasyland in 2012 Daisy became available for meet and greets at [[Pete's Silly Sideshow]]. At [[Epcot]], she appears at the main entrance. She also appeared in a few restaurants such as the Tusker House, and Minnie's Springtime Dine at [[Hollywood & Vine (restaurant)|Hollywood & Vine]].\n\nDaisy appears in an [[MMORPG]] game called [[Toontown Online]]. She appears in the playground called Daisy Gardens. She is an NPC character that walks around leaving comments about passing Toons.\n{{clear}}\n\n==On television==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\n[[Image:Quackpack6.jpg|thumb|right|Daisy was given a more modern appearance in ''Quack Pack'' (1996)]]\nDaisy never appeared on ''[[DuckTales]]'', although Donald's own appearances in that series were limited. In the 1996 television series ''[[Quack Pack]]'', Daisy was presented as a much more liberated (and patient) woman than in her previous appearances, where she was employed as a television station [[reporter]], with Donald as her cameraman. In ''Quack Pack'', Daisy had a pet [[Iguana]] named Knuckles.\n\nDaisy also has appeared in the later television series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' as a regular character (all of which were on the [[Disney Channel]]). She is also a main character in the ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'' shorts and ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''\n\n==In video games==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video game series, {{nihongo|Daisy Duck|\u30c7\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af|Deij\u012b Dakku|lead=yes}} appeared as a countess in Disney Castle. Her relations to Donald remain intact, especially in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' when she was seen scolding him. Goofy- speaking to Sora- refers to her as \"Donald's very special sweetheart.\" She also appeared without speaking in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep]]'', in Disney Town alongside various other Disney characters.\n\nDaisy is a playable character in the video game ''[[Disney Think Fast]]'' and a playable race driver in the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color racing game ''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]''.\n\nIn the Wii video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', a robot version of Daisy appears in the game, built by the Mad Doctor (before his betrayal) as Oswald wanted to replicate Mickey's friends. Her parts, after the Doctor's Beetleworx attacked her, were then scattered around Ventureland, and Mickey can find them or not. In the ending, depending on if she was restored or not, she is either seen restored and cuddling a tiki mask of Donald Duck, or still as a head in her glass case, harassed by a nearby pirate.\n\nDaisy is also one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game Disney Kart Circuit Tour. Like [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Pluto(Disney)]] she is a lightweight character.\n\nIn the Wii video game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves]]'', Daisy Duck appears as one of the random backup dancers if you are playing with 1 or 2 players.\n\nDaisy runs the Daisy Gardens neighborhood in ''[[Disney's Toontown Online]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Inducks character|DA}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170725075645/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000629/ Daisy Duck] on [[IMDb]]\n{{Disney Characters}}\n{{Disney's Fantasia}}\n{{Quack Pack}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duck, Daisy}}\n[[Category:Disney comics characters]]\n[[Category:Disney core universe characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional ducks]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic birds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1940]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]\n[[Category:Animal superheroes]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]", "sha1": "lmg9yvuvdudki0pm82uok0svditubqb"}}, {"title": "Dot-com bubble", "ns": "0", "id": "9021", "revision": {"id": "866431100", "parentid": "866356977", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T08:31:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "comment": "dab tag removed (good link)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Nasdaq Composite dot-com bubble.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[NASDAQ Composite]] index spiked in the late 1990s and then fell sharply as a result of the dot-com bubble.]]\n[[File:US VC funding.png|right|thumb|260px|Quarterly U.S. Venture Capital Investments 1995-2017]]\n\nThe '''dot-com bubble''' (also known as the '''dot-com boom''',<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-the-kings-of-the-1990s-dot-com-bubble-bust-2016-12 | title=One of the kings of the '90s dot-com bubble now faces 20 years in prison | first=Jim | last=Edwards | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=December 6, 2016}}</ref> the '''tech bubble''',<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tech_bubble.asp | title=Tech Bubble | work=[[Investopedia]] | date=September 19, 2007}}</ref> and the '''Internet bubble''') was a historic [[economic bubble]] and period of excessive [[speculation]] that occurred roughly from 1995 to 2000, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the [[Internet]].<ref name=causes>{{cite book | title=Rise and Burst of the Dotcom Bubble: Causes, Characteristics, Examples | last=Wollscheid | first=Christian | publisher=GRIN Verlag | date=July 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nasdaq Composite]] [[stock market index]], which included many Internet-based companies, peaked in value on March 10, 2000 before crashing.

All future [[cash flow]]s are estimated and [[Discounting|discounted]] by using cost of capital to give their [[present value]]s (PVs). The sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and outgoing, is the [[net present value]] (NPV), which is taken as the value of the cash flows in question.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/finance-dictionary/what-is-a-discounted-cash-flow-DCF|title = Wall Street Oasis (DCF)|date = |accessdate = 5 February 2015|website = Wall Street Oasis|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nUsing DCF analysis to compute the NPV takes as input cash flows and a discount rate and gives as output a present value; the opposite process\u2014takes cash flows and a price (present value) as inputs, and provides as output the discount rate\u2014this is used in bond markets to obtain the [[Yield (finance)|yield]].\n\nDiscounted cash flow analysis is widely used in investment finance, [[real estate developer|real estate development]], [[corporate financial]] management and [[patent valuation]].  It was used in industry as early as the 1700s or 1800s, widely discussed in financial economics in the 1960s, and became widely used in U.S. Courts in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=The Evolution of Valuation in Bankruptcy|journal=American Bankruptcy Law Journal|date=2017|ssrn=2810622}}</ref>\n\n==Discount rate==\n{{main|Discounting}}\nThe most widely used method of [[discounting]] is exponential discounting, which values future cash flows as \"how much money would have to be invested currently, at a given rate of return, to yield the cash flow in future.\" Other methods of discounting, such as [[hyperbolic discounting]], are studied in academia and said to reflect intuitive decision-making, but are not generally used in industry.\n\nThe discount rate used is generally the appropriate [[weighted average cost of capital]] (WACC), that reflects the risk of the cash flows. This WACC can be found using Perry's calculation model which was developed in 1996. The discount rate reflects two things:\n\n# Time value of money ([[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]]) \u2013 according to the theory of [[time preference]], investors would rather have cash immediately than having to wait and must therefore be compensated by paying for the delay\n# [[Risk premium]] \u2013 reflects the extra return investors demand because they want to be compensated for the risk that the cash flow might not materialize after all\n\n==History==\nDiscounted cash flow calculations have been used in some form since money was first lent at interest in ancient times. Studies of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics suggest that they used techniques similar to discounting of the future cash flows.

[[Irving Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''The Theory of Interest'' and [[John Burr Williams]]'s 1938 text ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'' first formally expressed the DCF method in modern economic terms.<ref>Fisher, Irving. \"The theory of interest.\" ''New York'' 43 (1930).</ref>\n\n==Mathematics==\n\n===Discounted cash flows===\nThe discounted cash flow formula is derived from the [[future value]] formula for calculating the [[time value of money]] and compounding returns.\n\n:<math>DCF = \\frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\dotsb +\n\\frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}</math>\n\n:<math>FV = DCF \\cdot (1+r)^n</math>\nThus the discounted present value (for one cash flow in one future period) is expressed as:\n\n:<math>DPV =  \\frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''DPV'' is the discounted present value of the future cash flow (''FV''), or ''FV'' adjusted for the delay in receipt;\n* ''FV'' is the nominal value of a cash flow amount in a future period;\n* ''r'' is the interest rate or discount rate, which reflects the cost of tying up capital and may also allow for the risk that the payment may not be received in full;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.gov.uk/sib_knowledge_box/discount-rates-and-net-present-value |title=Discount rates and net present value |publisher=Centre for Social Impact Bonds |accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref>\n* ''n'' is the time in years before the future cash flow occurs.\n\nWhere multiple cash flows in multiple time periods are discounted, it is necessary to sum them as follows:\n\n:<math>DPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^{t}}</math>\n\nfor each future cash flow (''FV'') at any time period (''t'') in years from the present time, summed over all time periods. The sum can then be used as a [[net present value]] figure. If the amount to be paid at time&nbsp;0 (now) for all the future cash flows is known, then that amount can be substituted for ''DPV'' and the equation can be solved for ''r'', that is the [[internal rate of return]].\n\nAll the above assumes that the interest rate remains constant throughout the whole period.\n\nIf the cash flow stream is assumed to continue indefinitely, the finite forecast is usually combined with the assumption of constant cash flow growth beyond the discrete projection period. The total value of such cash flow stream is the sum of the finite discounted cash flow forecast and the [[Terminal value (finance)]].\n\n===Continuous cash flows===\nFor continuous cash flows, the summation in the above formula is replaced by an integration:\n\n:<math>DPV= \\int_0^T  FV(t) \\, e^{-\\lambda t} dt = \\int_0^T \\frac{FV(t)}{(1 + r)^t} \\, dt\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>FV(t)</math> is now the ''rate'' of cash flow, and <math>\\lambda = \\log(1+r)</math>.\n\n==Example DCF==\nTo show how discounted cash flow analysis is performed, consider the following example.\n\n: John Doe buys a house for $100,000. Three years later, he expects to be able to sell this house for $150,000.\n\nSimple subtraction suggests that the value of his profit on such a transaction would be $150,000 \u2212 $100,000 = $50,000, or 50%. If that $50,000 is [[amortization (business)|amortized]] over the three years, his implied annual return (known as the [[internal rate of return]]) would be about 14.5%. Looking at those figures, he might be justified in thinking that the purchase looked like a good idea.\n\n1.145<sup>3</sup> x $100,000 = $150,000, approximately.\n\nHowever, since three years have passed between the purchase and the sale, any cash flow from the sale must be discounted accordingly. At the time John Doe buys the house, the 3-year [[United States Treasury security#Treasury note|US Treasury Note]] rate is 5% per annum. Treasury Notes are generally considered to be inherently less risky than real estate, since the value of the Note is guaranteed by the US Government and there is a [[liquidity|liquid]] market for the purchase and sale of T-Notes. If he hadn't put his money into buying the house, he could have invested it in the relatively safe T-Notes instead. This 5% per annum can, therefore, be regarded as the [[risk-free interest rate]] for the relevant period (3 years).\n\nUsing the DPV formula above (FV=$150,000, i=0.05, n=3), that means that the value of $150,000 received in three years actually has a [[present value]] of $129,576 (rounded off). In other words, we would need to invest $129,576 in a T-Bond now to get $150,000 in 3 years almost risk-free. This is a quantitative way of showing that money in the future is not as valuable as money in the present ($150,000 in 3 years isn't worth the same as $150,000 now; it is worth $129,576 now).\n\nSubtracting the purchase price of the house ($100,000) from the [[present value]] results in the [[net present value]] of the whole transaction, which would be $29,576 or a little more than 29% of the purchase price.\n\nAnother way of looking at the deal as the excess return achieved (over the risk-free rate) is (114.5 - 105)/(100 + 5) or approximately 9.0% (still very respectable).\n\nBut what about risk?\n\nWe assume that the $150,000 is John's best estimate of the sale price that he will be able to achieve in 3 years time (after deducting all expenses). There is a lot of uncertainty about house prices, and the outcome may end up higher or lower than this estimate.\n\n(The house John is buying is in a \"good neighborhood,\" but market values have been rising quite a lot lately and the real estate market analysts in the media are talking about a slow-down and higher interest rates. There is a probability that John might not be able to get the full $150,000 he is expecting in three years due to a slowing of price appreciation, or that loss of liquidity in the real estate market might make it very hard for him to sell at all.)\n\nUnder normal circumstances, people entering into such transactions are risk-averse, that is to say that they are prepared to accept a lower expected return for the sake of avoiding risk. See [[Capital asset pricing model]] for a further discussion of this. For the sake of the example (and this is a gross simplification), let's assume that he values this particular risk at 5% per annum (we could perform a more precise probabilistic analysis of the risk, but that is beyond the scope of this article). Therefore, allowing for this risk, his expected return is now 9.0% per annum (the arithmetic is the same as above).\n\nAnd the excess return over the risk-free rate is now (109 - 105)/(100 + 5) which comes to approximately 3.8% per annum.\n\nThat return rate may seem low, but it is still positive after all of our discounting, suggesting that the investment decision is probably a good one: it produces enough profit to compensate for tying up capital and incurring risk with a little extra left over. When investors and managers perform DCF analysis, the important thing is that the net present value of the decision after discounting all future cash flows at least be positive (more than zero). If it is negative, that means that the investment decision would actually ''lose'' money even if it appears to generate a nominal profit. For instance, if the expected sale price of John Doe's house in the example above was not $150,000 in three years, but ''$130,000'' in three years or $150,000 in ''five'' years, then on the above assumptions buying the house would actually cause John to ''lose'' money in present-value terms (about $3,000 in the first case, and about $8,000 in the second). Similarly, if the house was located in an undesirable neighborhood and the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] was about to raise interest rates by five percentage points, then the risk factor would be a lot higher than 5%: it might not be possible for him to predict a profit in discounted terms even if he thinks he could sell the house for ''$200,000'' in three years.\n\nIn this example, only one future cash flow was considered.  For a decision which generates multiple cash flows in multiple time periods, all the cash flows must be discounted and then summed into a single [[net present value]].\n\n==Methods of appraisal of a company or project==\nThis is offered as a simple treatment of a complex subject. More detail is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nFor these valuation purposes, a number of different DCF methods are distinguished today, some of which are outlined below. The details are likely to vary depending on the [[capital structure]] of the company. However the assumptions used in the appraisal (especially the equity discount rate and the projection of the cash flows to be achieved) are likely to be at least as important as the precise model used.\n\nBoth the income stream selected and the associated [[cost of capital]] model determine the valuation result obtained with each method.\nThis is one reason these valuation methods are formally referred to as the Discounted Future Economic Income methods.\n\n===Equity-approach===\n* [[Flows to equity]] approach (FTE)\n** Discount the cash flows available to the holders of equity capital, after allowing for cost of servicing debt capital\n** Advantages: Makes explicit allowance for the cost of debt capital\n** Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate\n\n===Entity-approach===\n* [[Adjusted present value]] approach (APV)\n** Discount the cash flows before allowing for the debt capital (but allowing for the tax relief obtained on the debt capital)\n** Advantages: Simpler to apply if a specific project is being valued which does not have earmarked debt capital finance\n** Disadvantages: Requires judgement on choice of discount rate; no explicit allowance for cost of debt capital, which may be much higher than a [[risk-free rate]]\n* [[Weighted average cost of capital]] approach (WACC)\n** Derive a weighted cost of the capital obtained from the various sources and use that discount rate to discount the cash flows from the project\n** Advantages: Overcomes the requirement for debt capital finance to be earmarked to particular projects\n** Disadvantages: Care must be exercised in the selection of the appropriate income stream. The net cash flow to total invested capital is the generally accepted choice.\n* [[Total cash flow]] approach (TCF){{Clarify|date=February 2009}}\n** This distinction illustrates that the Discounted Cash Flow method can be used to determine the value of various business ownership interests. These can include equity or debt holders.\n** Alternatively, the method can be used to value the company based on the value of total invested capital. In each case, the differences lie in the choice of the income stream and discount rate. For example, the net cash flow to total invested capital and WACC are appropriate when valuing a company based on the market value of all invested capital.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F.

This practice has two substantial shortcomings. 1) The discount rate assumption relies on the market for competing investments at the time of the analysis, which would likely change, perhaps dramatically, over time, and 2) straight line assumptions about income increasing over ten years are generally based upon historic increases in market rent but never factors in the cyclical nature of many real estate markets. Most loans are made during boom real estate markets and these markets usually last fewer than ten years. Using DCF to analyze commercial real estate during any but the early years of a boom market will lead to overvaluation of the asset.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nDiscounted cash flow models are powerful, but they do have shortcomings. DCF is merely a mechanical valuation tool, which makes it subject to the principle \"[[garbage in, garbage out]]\". Small changes in inputs can result in large changes in the value of a company. Instead of trying to project the cash flows to infinity, terminal value techniques are often used. A simple perpetuity is used to estimate the terminal value past 10 years, for example. This is done because it is harder to come to a realistic estimate of the cash flows as time goes on involves calculating the period of time likely to recoup the initial outlay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp |title=Discounted Cash Flow - DCF|publisher=investopedia.com |access-date=22 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother shortcoming is the fact that the Discounted Cash Flow Valuation should only be used as a method of intrinsic valuation for companies with predictable, though not necessarily stable, cash flows. The Discounted Cash Flow valuation method is widely used in valuing mature companies in stable industry sectors such as Utilities. At the same time, this method is often applied to valuation of high growth technology companies. In valuing young companies without much cash flow track record, the Discounted Cash Flow method may be applied a number of times to assess a number of possible future outcomes, such as the best, worst and mostly likely case scenarios.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Adjusted present value]]\n*[[Capital asset pricing model]]\n*[[Capital budgeting]]\n*[[Cost of capital]]\n*[[Debt cash flow]]\n*[[Economic value added]]\n*[[Enterprise value]]\n*[[Financial modeling]]\n*[[Flows to equity]]\n*[[Free cash flow]]\n*[[Internal rate of return]]\n*[[Market value added]]\n*[[Net present value]]\n*[[Patent valuation]]\n*[[Residual Income Valuation]]\n*[[Time value of money]]\n*[[Valuation using discounted cash flows]]\n*[[Weighted average cost of capital]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.iacam.org/ International Association of CPAs, Attorneys, and Management (IACAM)] (Free DCF Valuation E-Book Guidebook)\n*{{cite book | author=International Federation of Accountants | title=Project Appraisal Using Discounted Cash Flow | year=2007}}\n*{{cite book | last=Copeland | first=Thomas E. |author2=Tim Koller|author3=Jack Murrin | title=[[Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies]] | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | year=2000 | isbn=0-471-36190-9}}\n*{{cite book | author=[[Damodaran, Aswath]] | title=[[Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset]] | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=0-471-13393-0}}\n*{{cite book | author=Rosenbaum, Joshua |author2=Joshua Pearl | title=Investment Banking: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers & Acquisitions | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=Hoboken, NJ | year=2009 | isbn=0-470-44220-4}}\n*{{cite book | author=James R.

It is a major district town\u2014a ''[[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]''\u2014of the [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Upper Bavaria]], about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} north-west of [[Munich]].  It is now a popular residential area for people working in Munich with roughly 45,000 inhabitants.  The historic centre of town with its 18th-century castle is situated on an elevation and visible over a great distance.\n\nDachau was founded in the 9th century.  It was home to many artists during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; well-known author and editor [[Ludwig Thoma]] lived here for two years.  The town is also known for its proximity to the infamous [[Dachau concentration camp]] built in 1933 by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], in which tens of thousands of prisoners died.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of the name is not known, it possibly originated with the [[Celts]] who lived there before the Germans came. An alternative idea is that it comes from the old high German word '''daha''' meaning clay, and '''ouwe''', water overflown land.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric times and Early Middle Ages===\nAs the [[Amper]] River would divert into backwaters in several places, there were many fords making it possible to cross the river. The oldest findings of human presence here date back to the [[Stone Age]].  The most noteworthy findings were discovered near Feldgeding in the adjoining municipality Bergkirchen.\nAround 1000 B.C. the [[Celts]] arrived in this area and settled.  The name \u201cDachau\u201d originated in the Celtic ''Dahauua'', which roughly translates to \u201cloamy meadow\u201d and also alludes to the loamy soil of the surrounding hills. Some theories assume the name \u201cAmper\u201d river may derive from the Celtic word for \u201cwater\u201d. \nApproximately at the turn of the first millennium the Romans conquered the area and incorporated it into the province of [[Rhaetia]]. A Roman trade road between [[Salzburg]] and today\u2019s [[Augsburg]] is said to have run through Dachau. Remains of this old route are found along the Amper marshlands.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nThe first known documentation of Dachau occurs in a medieval deed issued by the Noble Erchana of Dahauua to the prince-bishop of [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising|Freising]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dachau.de/en/tourism/history/history.html|title=Stadt Dachau: History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dachau.de|language=German|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>, both descendants of the lineage of the [[Aribonids]]. With this deed, dated to August 15, 805 A.D. (''[[Assumption of Mary|the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]''), she donated her entire property in Dachau, including five so-called ''Colonenh\u00f6fe'' and some serfs and bondsman, to devolve to the Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Diocese of Freising]] after her death.\n\nDuring much of the 12th century, Dachau was the primary residence of a smaller branch from the [[House of Wittelsbach]] led by [[Otto I, Count of Scheyern-Dachau-Valley|Otto I, Count of Scheyern-Dauchau]]. When Conrad III died in 1182, [[Otto I, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Otto I]] of [[Bavaria]] purchased the land and granted it [[Market town|market rights]], that were then affirmed between 1270 and 1280 by [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Ludwig II der Strenge]] (the Strict).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.finanzamt.bayern.de/Dachau/Ueber_uns/Geschichte/default.php?f=Dachau&c=n&d=x&t=x|title=Finanzamt Dachau: \u00dcber uns - Geschichte|last=|first=|date=2014-04-25|website=www.finanzamt.bayern.de|language=German|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1467 [[Sigismund, Duke of Bavaria]] resigned and then kept only Bavaria-Dachau as his domain until his death in 1501.\n\n===From the 16th century to modern times===\nBetween 1546 and 1577, the House of [[Wittelsbach]] had the [[Dachau Palace]] erected in the [[Renaissance]] style. From June 1715 to Autumn 1717, [[Joseph Effner]] remodeled the palace to suit the contemporary taste in style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the castle's north-, east- and south-wing had to be demolished due to their state of disrepair. The west-wing housing the dance hall with a superb view of the enchanting gardens, still remains today. On the first floor the original [[renaissance]] wood carved, coffered ceiling can be admired by visitors.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the town began to attract landscape artists. The [[Dachau art colony]], which flourished between 1890 and 1914, brought the town recognition as one of the most important artist's colonies in Germany beside [[Worpswede]].\n\n===Second World War===\nIn 1933 the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was built east of the city by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and operated until 1945. It was the first of what became many [[Concentration camp|camps]]. 14,100 prisoners were murdered in the camp and almost another 10,000 in its subcamps.<ref>That Was Dachau 1933 - 1945 by Stanislav Z\u00e1me\u010dn\u00edk Page 377 and 379</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Geographical location===\nDachau is {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Munich]]. It is 482 meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] by the river [[Amper]], with a boundary demarcated by lateral [[moraine]]s formed during the last [[Wisconsin glaciation|ice age]] and the Amper [[glacial valley]]. It is also close to a large marshy area called Dachauer Moos. Highest elevation of the district is the so-called \"Schlossberg\", the lowest point is near the neighborhood of Prittlbach, at the border to the next community of [[Hebertshausen]]. The bordering communities are [[Bergkirchen]] to the west, [[Schwabhausen]] to the northwest, [[R\u00f6hrmoos]] to the north, Hebertshausen to the northeast, and [[Karlsfeld]] to the south. To the east the greater district Dachau borders on the greater district of Munich with the community of [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim]].\n\nThe city is divided into 3 zones:\n\n* Historic Center: Dachau Old Town, Mitterndorf, Udlding, Etzenhausen, Unterer Markt, Webling\n* Dachau-East: Oberaugustenfeld, Unteraugustenfeld, Polln, Obergrashof, parts of Prittlbach\n* Dachau-South: Himmelreich, Holzgarten, parts of Gr\u00f6benried\n\nSince 1972 the former communities of Pellheim with Pullhausen, Assenhausen, Lohfeld, and Viehgarten have been incorporated into Dachau.\n\n==Bodies of water==\nRunning from the west, the river Amper runs south of Dachau\u2019s old town, changes its direction at the former paper milling plant to the northeast and continues through Prittlbach into Hebertshausen.\n\nComing from Karlsfeld, the W\u00fcrm crosses Dachau-East and merges into the river Amper just outside the district limit of Hebertshausen.\n\nThe Gr\u00f6benbach, which has its source south of Puchheim, runs through town coming from the south and merges into the Amper river at several locations near the festival grounds.\n\nThe M\u00fchlbach, a man made canal, is diverted from the river Amper at the electrical power plant and runs parallel and flows back into it after passing the paper mill. The name derives from the frequent mills in former times along the canal which   took advantage of the decline between M\u00fchlbach and Amper. West of the so-called Festwiese runs another canal, called Lodererbach.\n\nIn town there are still parts of the Schlei\u00dfheimer canal remaining today. This canal was built in the mid-eighteenth century as part of the northern Munich canal system to which the Nymphenburger Canal belongs as well.  \nIt functioned as a transportation route between Dachau and Schlei\u00dfheim. The building material recovered from the demolition of three wings of the Dachau castle was transported to Schlei\u00dfheim this way.\n\nBy allowing it to run to seed and through deliberate cultivation by the town of Dachau the canal is only still recognizable as such between Fr\u00fchlingstrasse and the Pollnbach. Outside the city limit the original canal continues on to Schloss Schlei\u00dfheim.\n\nWithin the city boundaries, in Dachau S\u00fcd (South), there is also a small lake called Stadtweiher.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Dachau Railway and Bus Station.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Dachau railway station|Dachau Train and Bus Station]]]]\n\nThe city is served by [[Munich S-Bahn]] (S2) and [[Deutsche Bahn]] via [[Dachau railway station]] located in the South of the town. The station is also annexed to the central bus terminal. In Dachau the line S2 is split in two directions: Petershausen and Altom\u00fcnster. Both lines are named S2 but with different direction names. The offshoot to Altom\u00fcnster is also served by Dachau Stadt Railway Station which is much smaller than the main railway station. There are five bus lines which are operated by Stadtwerke Dachau: 719, 720, 722, 724 and 726. There is no tramway transport.\n\nDachau has a well-developed road infrastructure for regional transportation. The city is connected to [[Bundesautobahn 8]] (via F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck) with Munich-[[Pasing]] southbound, and westbound terminating in [[Karlsruhe]]. Dachau is connected to [[Bundesautobahn 92]] via [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim]] connector which is located east of Dachau. [[Bundesautobahn 99]] is connected with Dachau via Karlsfeld which is located south of Dachau. [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]] No. 471 (via Rothschwaige) connects eastbound towns such as the neighboring city F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck and westbound towns such as Oberschlei\u00dfheim. Bundesstra\u00dfe No. 304 starts in the south of the city and connects southbound towns until the [[German-Austrian border]]. Additionally, several [[Staatsstra\u00dfe]]n connect Dachau with surrounding towns and villages.\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:DachauAutumn20021025.JPG|thumbnail|right|225px|Dachau in fall 2002]]\n* Old town including the Town Hall\n* Church of St. Jakob (St. James), built in the 17th century (Stadtpfarrkirche).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n* Church of St. Nicolas and St. Mary, Mitterndorf (1496)\n* [[Dachau Palace]] and Palace Garden: A medieval castle which became the favorite residence of the Bavarian dukes in the 16th century.

They should not be confused with the [[Tephritidae]], a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as \"true fruit flies\"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe [[fruit]], with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]]. One species of ''Drosophila'' in particular, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', has been heavily used in research in [[genetics]] and is a common [[model organism]] in [[developmental biology]]. The terms \"fruit fly\" and \"''Drosophila''\" are often used synonymously with ''D. melanogaster'' in modern biological literature.

Many species, including the noted Hawaiian picture-wings, have distinct black patterns on the wings. The plumose (feathery) [[arista (biology)|arista]], bristling of the head and thorax, and wing venation are characters used to diagnose the family. Most are small, about 2\u20134&nbsp;mm long, but some, especially many of the Hawaiian species, are larger than a [[house fly]].\n\n==Lifecycle and ecology==\n\n===Habitat===\n''Drosophila'' species are found all around the world, with more species in the tropical regions.

Those such as ''D. melanogaster'' that breed in large, relatively rare resources have [[ovaries]] that mature 10\u201320 eggs at a time, so that they can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself, but on the [[yeast]]s and [[microorganism]]s present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as [[temperature]], breeding substrate, and crowding. \nFruit flies lay eggs in response to environmental cycles. Eggs laid at a time (e.g., night) during which likelihood of survival is greater than in eggs laid at other times (e.g., day) yield more larvae than eggs that were laid at those times. ''Ceterus paribus'', the habit of laying eggs at this 'advantageous' time would yield more surviving offspring, and more grandchildren, than the habit of laying eggs during other times. This differential reproductive success would cause ''D. melanogaster'' to adapt to environmental cycles, because this behavior has a major reproductive advantage.<ref>Howlader, G., Sharma, K.

In 1906, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] began his work on ''D. melanogaster'' and reported his first finding of a [[White (mutation)|white eyed mutant]] in 1910 to the academic community. He was in search of a model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on ''Drosophila'' earned him the 1933 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for identifying [[chromosome]]s as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other ''Drosophila'' species are widely used in studies of [[genetics]], [[Drosophila embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], [[Drosophila circadian rhythm|chronobiology]], [[speciation]], [[neurobiology]], and other areas.\n\nHowever, some species of ''Drosophila'' are difficult to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For some, it can be done with particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as [[sterols]] that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal ''Drosophila'' lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The ''Drosophila'' Species Stock Center] located at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca]], New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Drosophila Species Stock Center {{!}} College of Agriculture and Life Science |url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/drosophila/ |website=blogs.cornell.edu |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Microbiome===\nLike other metazoans, ''Drosophila'' is associated with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut microbiota or microbiome seems to have a central influence on ''Drosophila'' fitness and life history characteristics. The [[Microbiome in the Drosophila gut|microbiota in the gut of ''Drosophila'']] represents an active current research field.\n\n===Predators===\n''Drosophila'' species are prey for many generalist predators such as [[Asilidae|robber flies]]. In [[Hawaii]], the introduction of [[Vespula|yellowjackets]] from the mainland United States has led to the decline of many of the large species. The larvae are preyed on by other fly larvae, [[Staphylinidae|staphylinid]] [[beetle]]s, and [[ant]]s.\n\n==Systematics==\n{{Cladogram\n|clades={{Clade\n| style=font-size:85%;line-height:85%\n|2={{Clade\n   |1=&nbsp;Old&nbsp;World&nbsp;''Sophophora''\n   |2={{Clade\n      |1=&nbsp;New&nbsp;World&nbsp;''Sophophora''\n      |2=&nbsp;''[[Lordiphosa]]''\n      |3=&nbsp;''[[Hirtodrosophila duncani]]''\n      }}\n   }}\n|1={{Clade\n   |1={{Clade\n      |1={{Clade\n         |1=&nbsp;[[immigrans-tripunctata radiation|''immigrans-tripunctata''&nbsp;radiation]]\n         |2={{Clade\n            |1={{Clade\n               |1=&nbsp;[[Drosophila quadrilineata species group|''D.&nbsp;quadrilineata''&nbsp;species&nbsp;group]]               |2=&nbsp;''[[Samoaia]]''\n               }}\n            |2={{Clade\n               |1=&nbsp;''[[Zaprionus]]''\n               |2={{Clade\n                  |1=&nbsp;[[Drosophila tumiditarsus species group|''D.&nbsp;tumiditarsus''&nbsp;species&nbsp;group]]\n                  |2=&nbsp;''[[Liodrosophila]]''\n                  }}\n               }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      |2={{Clade\n         |1=&nbsp;''[[Dichaetophora (flies)|Dichaetophora]]''\n         |2=&nbsp;''[[Hirtodrosophila]]''\n         |3={{Clade\n            |1=&nbsp;''[[Mycodrosophila]]''\n            |2=&nbsp;''[[Paramycodrosophila]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      |3={{Clade\n         |1={{Clade\n            |1=&nbsp;{{nowrap|[[virilis-repleta radiation|''virilis-repleta'' radiation (in part)]]}}\n            |2={{Clade\n               |1=&nbsp;[[Siphlodora|subgenus&nbsp;''Siphlodora'']]\n               |2=&nbsp;{{nowrap|[[virilis-repleta radiation|''virilis-repleta'' radiation (in part)]]}}\n               }}\n            }}\n         |2={{Clade\n            |1=&nbsp;[[Hawaiian Drosophila|Hawaiian ''Drosophila'']]\n            |2=&nbsp;''[[Scaptomyza]]''\n            }}\n         |3=&nbsp;[[Drosophila polychaeta species group|''D.&nbsp;polychaeta''&nbsp;species&nbsp;group]]\n         }}\n      }}\n   |2=&nbsp;''[[Dorsilopha]]''\n   }}\n}}\n}}\n[[File:Drosophila setosimentum.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Drosophila setosimentum|D. setosimentum]]'', a species of Hawaiian picture-wing fly]]\nThe [[genus]] ''Drosophila'' as currently defined is [[paraphyletic]] (see below) and contains 1,450 described species,<ref name=taxodros/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Therese A.

This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology.

The study is based and directly related to factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an [[institution]]. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the [[military]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title=\"Military Government and Dictatorship.\"|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5723774494|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1\u20137|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Single-party dictatorships ===\n{{Main|One-party state}}\nSingle-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. Other parties may legally exist, compete in elections, and even hold legislative seats, yet true political power lies with the dominant party. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \u201corganizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title=\"Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists.\"|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/208155326|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339\u2013342|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Monarchies ===\n[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>\"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them \u2018Dictators\u2019, not \u2018Kings\u2019]\".

Elites in monarchies are typically members of the royal family.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Hybrid dictatorships ===\nHybrid dictatorships are regimes that blend qualities of personalist, singleparty, and military dictatorships.

Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a king in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and Fascist dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hirohito]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and other Fascist dictatorships;\n* [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s [[North Korea]] and other [[Communism|Communist]] dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, China and other countries.\n\n=== Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[Kleptocracy]]\n* [[List of longest-ruling non-royal national leaders since 1900]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Negative selection (politics)]]\n* [[Neo-fascism]]\n* [[Neo-Nazism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Plutocracy]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n* [[Tyranny of the majority]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading  ==\n* {{cite book|last=Friedrich|first=Carl J.|author2=Brzezinski, Zbigniew K.|authorlink2=Zbigniew Brzezinski|title=Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy|publisher=Praeger|edition= 2nd|year=1965}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bueno de Mesquita|first1=Bruce|first2=Alastair|last2=Smith|first3=Randolph M.|last3=Siverson|first4=James D.|last4=Morrow|title=The Logic of Political Survival|year=2003|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|isbn=0-262-63315-9}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Dictator's Learning Curve: Inside the Global Battle for Democracy|author=[[William J.

He had parted with his wife and had formed a relationship with one of his distant cousins, Sophie Ziegler, nicknamed \"Naguine.\"<ref name=Fogg/>{{rp|11}} They traveled throughout France with Reinhardt getting occasional jobs playing at small clubs. He had no definite goals, living a hand-to-mouth existence.<ref name=Fogg/>{{rp|11}} The concept of money and saving was foreign to him, and he spent his earnings as quickly as he made them.<ref name=Fogg/>{{rp|11}}\n\nOne change during this period was his abandonment of the banjo in favor of the guitar. He was playing all types of music previously but began to appreciate American jazz a little during this period, when an acquaintance, [[\u00c9mile Savitry]], played him a number of records from his collection.<ref name=Fogg/>{{rp|12}} It was the first time Reinhardt heard leading American jazz musicians, such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]]. The new sounds gave Reinhardt a vision and goal of becoming a jazz professional.<ref name=Fogg/>{{rp|12}}\n\nHe later met [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]], a young violinist with similar musical interests. In the absence of paid work in their radical new music, the two would [[jam session|jam]] together, along with a loose circle of other musicians.<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|26}} Finally, Reinhardt acquired his first [[Selmer guitar]] in the mid-1930s. He used the volume and expressiveness of the instrument as integral elements of his style.\n\n===Formation of the quintet===\n[[File:Django&Grappelli (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Reinhardt and Grappelli]]\n\nFrom 1934 until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Reinhardt and Grappelli worked together as the principal soloists of their newly formed [[Quintette du Hot Club de France|Hot Club]], in Paris.

He used three guitarists along with an [[accordion]] lead, violin, and bass. In August 1934, he made other recordings with more than one guitar (Joseph Reinhardt, Roger Chaput, and Reinhardt), including the first recording by the Quintette. In both years the great majority of their recordings featured a wide variety of horns, often in multiples, piano, and other instruments,<ref name=\"djangomontreal\">{{cite web|last=Rousseau|first=Fran\u00e7ois|title=Welcome|url=http://www.djangomontreal.com/Django_Montreal/Welcome.html |publisher=Django Montreal|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> but the all-string instrumentation is the one most often adopted by emulators of the Hot Club sound.\n\nDecca Records in the United States released three records of Quintette songs with Reinhardt on guitar, and one other, credited to \"Stephane Grappelli & His Hot 4 with Django Reinhardt\", in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.78discography.com/Dec23000.htm |title=DECCA (USA) 78rpm numerical listing discographyL 23000 \u2013 23500 |website=''78discography.com'' |date=26 September 2015 |accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nReinhardt also played and recorded with many American jazz musicians, such as [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Rex Stewart]] (who later stayed in Paris). He participated in a jam session and radio performance with [[Louis Armstrong]]. Later in his career, Reinhardt played with [[Dizzy Gillespie]] in France. Also in the neighborhood was the artistic salon [[R-26 (salon)|R-26]], at which Reinhardt and Grappelli performed regularly as they developed their unique musical style.<ref>Tranchant, Jean (1969).

Reinhardt returned to Paris at once,<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|98\u201399}} leaving his wife in the UK. Grappelli remained in the United Kingdom for the duration of the war.

In the autumn of 1946, he made his first tour in the United States, debuting at [[Cleveland Music Hall]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Meiksins |first=Robin |url=http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/525 |title=Django Reinhardt at the Music Hall |publisher=Cleveland Historical |accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref> as a special guest soloist with [[Duke Ellington]] and His Orchestra. He played with many notable musicians and composers, such as [[Maury Deutsch]]. At the end of the tour, Reinhardt played two nights at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City; he received a great ovation and took six curtain calls on the first night.\n\nDespite his pride in touring with Ellington (one of two letters to Grappelli relates his excitement), he was not fully integrated into the band. He played a few tunes at the end of the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written for him. After the tour, Reinhardt secured an engagement at Caf\u00e9 Society Uptown, where he played four solos a day, backed by the resident band. These performances drew large audiences.<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|138\u2013139}} Having failed to bring his usual Selmer Mod\u00e8le Jazz, he played on a borrowed electric guitar, which he felt hampered the delicacy of his style.<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|138}} He had been promised jobs in California, but they failed to develop.

He sometimes showed up for scheduled concerts without a guitar or amplifier, or wandered off to the park or beach. On a few occasions he refused to get out of bed. Reinhardt developed a reputation among his band, fans, and managers as extremely unreliable. He skipped sold-out concerts to \"walk to the beach\" or \"smell the dew.\"<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|145}} During this period he continued to attend the [[R-26 (salon)|R-26]] artistic salon in Montmartre, improvising with his devoted collaborator, St\u00e9phane Grappelli.<ref>Tranchant, Jean: pg. 116, ''La Grande Roue''; \u00c9ditions de la Table Ronde, Paris, 1969.</ref><ref>De Visscher, \u00c9ric.

He continued to play in Paris jazz clubs and began playing electric guitar. (He often used a Selmer fitted with an electric pickup, despite his initial hesitation about the instrument.) In his final recordings, made with his Nouvelle Quintette in the last few months of his life, he had begun moving in a new musical direction, in which he assimilated the vocabulary of [[bebop]] and fused it with his own melodic style.<ref name=Givan>{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Givan|title=The Music of Django Reinhardt|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-472-03408-6|pages=158\u201394}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, While walking from the [[Gare de Fontainebleau\u2013Avon Station]] after playing in a Paris club, he collapsed outside his house from a [[brain hemorrhage]].<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|160}}\nIt was a Saturday (date?) and it took a full day for a doctor to arrive.<ref name=Delaunay/>{{rp|161}} Reinhardt was declared [[dead on arrival]] at the hospital in Fontainebleau, at the age of 43.\n\n==Family==\nReinhardt's second son, [[Babik Reinhardt|Babik]], became a guitarist in the contemporary jazz style. His first son, [[Lousson Reinhardt|Lousson]], was more of a traditionalist. He followed the Romani lifestyle and rarely performed in public.\nAfter Reinhardt died, his brother Joseph at first swore to abandon music, but he was persuaded to perform and record again. Joseph's son Markus Reinhardt is a violinist in the Romani style.\n\nA third generation of direct descendants has developed as musicians: David Reinhardt, Reinhardt's grandson (by his son Babik), leads his own trio. Dallas Baumgartner, a great-grandson by Lousson, is a guitarist who travels with the Romani and keeps a low public profile. A slightly younger distant relative, violinist [[Schnuckenack Reinhardt]], became famous in Germany as a performer of gypsy music and gypsy jazz up to his death in 2006, and also assisted in keeping Reinhardt's legacy alive through the period following his death.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Main article|Gypsy jazz}}\n\nReinhardt is regarded as one of the greatest guitar players of all time, and the first important European jazz musician to make a major contribution with jazz guitar.<ref name=Fetherolf>Fetherolf, Bob.

Garcia was quoted in June 1985 in ''Frets Magazine'': \n<blockquote>His technique is awesome! Even today, nobody has really come to the state that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven't gotten to where he is. There's a lot of guys that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar has come a long way as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of incredible speed \u2013 all the speed you could possibly want \u2013 but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don't hear it.

The first four are now available on Matelo's CD ''Tziganska\u00efa and Other Rare Recordings'', released by Hot Club Records (subsequently reissued as ''Tziganska\u00efa: The Django Reinhardt Waltzes''); \"Chez Jacquet\" was also recorded by [[Baro Ferret]] in 1966. \n\nThe names \"Gagoug\" and \"Choti\" were reportedly conferred by Django's [[widow]] Naguine on request from Matelo, who had learned the tunes without names. Django also worked on composing a Mass for use by the gypsies, which was not completed although an 8-minute extract exists, played by the organist L\u00e9o Chauliac for Reinhardt's benefit, via a 1944 radio broadcast; this can be found on the CD release \"Gipsy Jazz School\" and also on volume 12 of the \"Int\u00e9grale Django Reinhardt\" CD compilation.{{efn|Here is Lauren Oliver's transcript of the interview from the radio broadcast:\nIntroduction:\nVO: In the Chapel of the National Institute for Blind Children, Django Reinhardt will, for the first time, hear his mass played on the organ, which he has written especially for the gypsies. (Organ begins to play)\nInterview:\nAnnouncer: Could you tell me Mr Reinhardt, what has compelled you to write this mass?\nDR: All the gypsies in the entire world have made use of foreign masses for many centuries. I have written this mass to be interpreted by choir and organ.\nA: And in what surroundings do you isolate yourself in order to write \u2013 it's not a question of surroundings. For you certainly cannot do it after a jazz concert?\nDR: I prefer to write in the evening very late or in the morning in my bed.\nA: And did you notate the music?\nDR: No, it's not I who notates the music. It's my clarinetist in the Quintet of the Hot Club of France, Gerard Leveque. I dictate it to him.\nA: And is today the first recital of your mass?\nDR: It is an extract of my mass. I particularly don't know the ending. It's the first time I have heard the composition on the organ.\nA: Certainly you know, Mr Reinhardt, that in the world and particularly in France, it is said that you are the king of the gypsies. Is that accurate?\nDR: No, no, no, don't think that. But it might come to pass, perhaps one day. I am very loved by them, and I thank them by offering to them this mass.

7, 1964 \u2013 May 8, 1999) was an American actress who was notable for having played the role of [[Kimberly Drummond]] on the U.S. television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', from 1978 to 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/57045/Dana-Plato|title=Dana Plato - About This Person - Movies & TV - NYTimes.com|work=[[The New York

[[made-for-TV]] movies and in independent films, and did [[voice actor|voice-over work]]. At the age of 34, after years of struggling with [[poverty]] and [[substance abuse]], Plato died from an [[drug overdose|overdose]] of prescription drugs.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/10/arts/dana-plato-34-star-of-diff-rent-strokes.html |title=\u2019Dana Plato, 34, Star of 'Diff'rent Strokes' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 10, 1999 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref><ref name=deseret />\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1964\u20131977: Childhood and career beginnings===\nPlato was born '''Dana Michelle Strain''' on November 7, 1964, in [[Maywood, California]], to Linda Strain, an unwed teenager who was already caring for an 18-month-old child. In June 1965, the seven-month-old Dana was adopted by Dean Plato, who owned a trucking company, and his wife Florine \"Kay\" Plato.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|title=RootsWeb: Database Index|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> Plato was raised in the [[San Fernando Valley]].

Plato made her film debut at age 13, in the horror film ''[[Return to Boggy Creek]]'' (1977).<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/41121/Return-to-Boggy-Creek/cast|title=Return to Boggy Creek}}</ref> Other early credits included ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977) and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'' (1978).\n\nIn addition to acting, Plato was an accomplished figure skater; at one point she trained for a possible [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team spot. It was during this time that she made a brief appearance on TV's ''[[The Gong Show]]'' and was spotted by a producer who helped her secure what became her most famous acting role, Kimberly Drummond on ''Diff'rent Strokes.'' According to Plato, her mother decided she should cut back on her skating in order to focus on the TV role.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===1978\u20131986: ''Diff'rent Strokes''===\n{{Main|Diff'rent Strokes}}\n''Diff'rent Strokes'' debuted on [[NBC]] in 1978, becoming an immediate hit. The show features Phillip Drummond ([[Conrad Bain]]), a wealthy white widower in New York City who adopts two black boys after their parents' deaths. Plato played Kimberly, Drummond's teenage daughter, who at the start of the show becomes the adoptive sister of the two boys, Willis ([[Todd Bridges]]) and Arnold ([[Gary Coleman]]). Plato appeared on the show from 1978 until 1984 and again from 1985 to 1986; during her tenure the show appeared on two different networks.\n\n[[Image:Dana Plato in 1983.jpg|right|thumb|Plato in 1983]]\n\nDuring her years on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', Plato struggled with drug and alcohol problems. She admitted to drinking alcohol, and using [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cocaine]], and she suffered an overdose of [[diazepam]] when she was 14.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/>\n\nIn December 1983, Plato moved in with her boyfriend, rock guitarist Lanny Lambert. The couple married on April 24, 1984, and their only child, Tyler Edward Lambert, was born on July 2, 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461|title=Free Family Tree, Genealogy and Family History - MyHeritage|website=familytreelegends.com}}</ref><ref name=\"abcnews\">{{cite news |first1=Luchina|last1=Fisher |first2=Sheila|last2=Marikar |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dana-platos-son-tyler-lambert-commits-suicide-mom/story?id=10629167 |title=Growing Pains: The Trials and Tribulations of 1980s TV Child Stars |work=ABC News |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> During this time, Plato was let go from ''Diff'rent Strokes'' because the producers did not feel that a pregnancy would fit the show's wholesome image. Although rumors of drug use and other problems on the set surrounded her dismissal, the producers were adamant that Plato's pregnancy was the only reason her character was written out{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nShe returned for six guest appearances during the show's seventh and eighth seasons. In the season 8 episode that aired on January&nbsp;17, 1986&mdash;Plato's final appearance on the show&mdash;Kimberly suffers from the effects of [[bulimia]].\n\n===1987\u20131998: After ''Diff'rent Strokes''===\nAfter leaving ''Diff'rent Strokes'', Plato attempted to establish herself as a serious actress but found it difficult to achieve success outside of her sitcom career. She had [[breast implant]]s and modeled for a June 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' pictorial, but her career remained in stagnation, and she started taking roles in such [[B-movies]] as ''Bikini Beach Race'' (1989) and ''Lethal Cowboy'' (1992).\n\nPlato separated from Lambert in January 1988, the same week her mother died of [[scleroderma]]. In desperation over these traumatic events, she signed over [[power of attorney]] to an accountant who disappeared with the majority of her money, leaving her with no more than $150,000. She claimed the accountant was never found nor prosecuted, despite an exhaustive search, and that he had also stolen more than $11 million of other people's money.<ref name=HowardSternShow/>\n\nDuring her March 1990 divorce, Plato lost custody of her son to Lambert and was given visitation rights.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/><ref name=\"abcnews\"/> She moved to [[Las Vegas]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, where she struggled with poverty and unemployment. At one point she worked at a dry-cleaning store, where customers reported being impressed by her lack of airs.<ref name=LittleGirlLost/>\n\nOn February 28, 1991, she entered a video store, produced a [[pellet gun]], and demanded the money in the cash register. The clerk called [[9-1-1|911]], saying, \"I've just been robbed by the girl who played Kimberly on ''Diff'rent Strokes''.\" Approximately 15 minutes after the robbery, Plato returned to the scene and was immediately arrested. The robbery netted Plato $164.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sporkin|first=Elizabeth|date=March 24, 1991|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114736,00.html|title=Diff'rent Strokes, Fallen Stars|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=35|issue=11}}</ref> Las Vegas entertainer [[Wayne Newton]] posted her $13,000 bail,<ref name=reelReviews>{{cite news|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/plato.htm |title=The Death of Dana Plato|work= Morbidly Hollywood}}</ref> and Plato was given five years' [[probation]]. Plato made headlines and became a subject of the national debate surrounding troubled child stars, particularly given the difficulties of her ''Diff'rent Strokes'' co-stars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges.\n\nIn January 1992, she was arrested again, this time for forging a prescription for Diazepam. She served 30 days in jail for violating the terms of her probation and entered a drug rehabilitation program immediately thereafter.\n\nIn 1992, Plato was one of the first celebrities to star in a video game. The game, ''[[Night Trap]]'', was not a great success (the majority of the game's video content was actually filmed in 1987 then shelved), but is considered a pioneering title because it was the first game to use live actors, specifically a well-known personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-cd/night-trap |title=MobyGames Page on Night Trap |website=MobyGames |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref>  It was one of the first video game titles to have mature content and attracted controversy due to its depiction of violence.

She spoke about her life, discussing her financial problems and past run-ins with the law. She admitted to being a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but claimed she had been sober for more than 10 years by that point, and was not using any drugs, with the exception of prescribed painkillers due to the recent extraction of two [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s. Many callers insulted her and questioned her sobriety, which provoked a defiant Plato who offered to take a drug test on the air.

It involves a player dropping the ball and then [[kick (football)|kicking]] it when it bounces off the ground.\n\nDrop kicks are most importantly used as a method of restarting play and scoring points in [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]. [[Association football]] [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] also often return the ball to play with drop kicks. The kick was once in wide use in both [[Australian rules football]] and [[gridiron football]], but is today rarely seen in either sport.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Rugby ==\n[[File:Pat O'Dea.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Pat O'Dea]]]]\n\n=== Drop kick technique ===\n{{See also|Drop goal}}\n\nThe drop kick technique in rugby codes is usually to hold the ball with one end pointing downwards in two hands above the kicking leg. The ball is dropped onto the ground in front of the kicking foot, which makes contact at the moment or fractionally after the ball touches the ground, called the ''half-volley''. The kicking foot usually makes contact with the ball slightly on the instep.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070623215626/http://www.coachingrugby.com/rugby/coaching/indskills/kicking/drop.htm \"Kicking: The Drop Kick\"] at www.coachingrugby.com.

Drop kicks are also mandatory to restart play from the 20 metre line after an unsuccessful penalty goal attempt goes dead or into touch-in-goal and to score a [[drop goal]] (sometimes known as a field goal) in open play, which is worth one point.<ref name=\"league\">{{cite book|url=http://www.rlef.eu.com/rugby_laws_book2004.pdf\n|title=The International Laws of the Game and Notes on the Laws\n|chapter=Section 6: Scoring\n|date=2004-03-11\n|publisher=[[Rugby League International Federation]]\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=2007-09-12\n|page=14\n}}</ref>\n\nDrop kicks are optional for a penalty kick to score a penalty goal (this being done rarely, as place kicks are generally used) and when kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, although the option of a punt kick is usually taken instead.\n\n=== Rugby union ===\nIn [[rugby union]], a drop kick is used for the kick-off and restarts and to score a [[drop goal]] (sometimes called a field goal). Originally, it was one of only two ways to score points, along with the [[place kick]].\n\nDrop kicks are mandatory from the centre spot to start a half (a kick-off), from the centre spot to restart the game after points have been scored, to restart play from the 22-metre line (called a drop-out) after the ball is touched down or made dead in the in-goal area by the defending team when the attacking team kicked or took the ball into the in-goal area, and to score a drop goal (sometimes called a field goal) in open play, which is worth three points.<ref name=\"union\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/070110LGLAW09red_662.pdf\n |title       = Law 9: Method of Scoring\n |work        = Laws of the Game\n |publisher   = International Rugby Board\n |format      = PDF\n |year        = 2007\n |accessdate  = 2007-09-12\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022213228/http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/LawsRegs/0/070110LGLAW09red_662.pdf\n |archivedate = 2007-10-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nDrop kicks are optional for a conversion kick after a try has been scored.\n\n=== Rugby sevens ===\nThe usage of drop kicks in rugby sevens is the same as in rugby union, except that drop kicks are used for all conversion attempts and for penalty kicks, both of which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored or the award of the penalty.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== American and Canadian (gridiron) football ==\nIn both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], one method of scoring a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] or [[extra point]] is by drop-kicking the football through the goal.\n\n[[File:Zach Curlin.png|thumb|left|130px|[[Zach Curlin]] drop kicking.]]\n\nIt contrasts with the [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]], wherein the player kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first; and the [[place kick]], wherein the player kicks a stationary ball off the ground: \"from placement\".

The ball would be [[Snap (football)|snapped]] or [[Lateral pass|lateraled]] to a back, who would fake a run or pass, but then would kick the field goal instead. This method of scoring worked well in the 1920s and early 1930s, when the football was rounder at the ends (similar to a modern rugby ball).

In 1649 the city and its garrison, which supported the republican [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in London, were besieged by Scottish [[Presbyterian]] forces loyal to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. The Parliamentarians besieged in Derry were relieved by a strange alliance of [[Roundhead]] troops under [[George Monck]] and the Irish Catholic general [[Owen Roe O'Neill]]. These temporary allies were soon fighting each other again however, after the landing in Ireland of the [[New Model Army]] in 1649. The war in Ulster was finally brought to an end when the Parliamentarians crushed the Irish Catholic Ulster army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near [[Letterkenny]] in nearby [[County Donegal]], in 1650.\n\nDuring the [[Glorious Revolution]], only Derry and nearby [[Enniskillen]] had a Protestant garrison by November 1688. An army of around 1,200 men, mostly \"''Redshanks''\" ([[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]]), under Alexander Macdonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised (they set out on the week William of Orange landed in England). When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the [[Siege of Derry]] began. In April 1689, King James came to the city and summoned it to surrender.

The large numbers of military personnel in Derry substantially altered the character of the city, bringing in some outside colour to the local area, as well as some cosmopolitan and economic buoyancy during these years. Several airfields were built in the outlying regions of the city at this time, Maydown, Eglinton and Ballykelly. RAF Eglinton went on to become [[City of Derry Airport]].\n\nThe city contributed significant number of men to the war effort throughout the services, most notably the 500 men in the 9th (Londonderry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, known as the 'Derry Boys'. This regiment served in North Africa, the Sudan, Italy and mainland UK. Many others served in the Merchant Navy taking part in the convoys that supplied the UK and Russia during the war.\n\nThe border location of the city, and influx of trade from the military convoys allowed for significant smuggling operations to develop in the city.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Second World War, eventually some 60 U-boats of the German [[Kriegsmarine]] ended in the city's harbour at [[Lisahally]] after their surrender.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.secondworldwarni.org/print.aspx?pagerecordid=1469\n| title = The U-boat surrender\n| accessdate = 13 February 2010\n| publisher = www.secondworldwarni.org}}</ref> The initial surrender was attended by Admiral Sir [[Max Kennedy Horton|Max Horton]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Western Approaches]], and Sir [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Basil Brooke]], third [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\"culturenorthernireland1\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\n====1950s and 1960s====\nThe city languished after the second world war, with unemployment and development stagnating.

[[Political science|Political scientist]] [[John Henry Whyte|John Whyte]] explains that:\n\n<blockquote>\nAll the accusations of gerrymandering, practically all the complaints about housing and regional policy, and a disproportionate amount of the charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area \u2013 which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh \u2013 had less than a quarter of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whyte|first=John|title=Contemporary Irish Studies|editor=Gallagher, Tom |editor2=O'Connell, James|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|year=1983|chapter=How much discrimination was there under the unionist regime, 1921\u201368?|isbn=978-0-7190-0919-8|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm#chap1}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA [[civil rights]] demonstration in 1968 led by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] was banned by the Government and blocked using force by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]].<ref name=DiscrimChron/> The events that followed the August 1969 [[Apprentice Boys]] parade resulted in the [[Battle of the Bogside]], when Catholic rioters fought the police, leading to widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and is often dated as the starting point of [[the Troubles]].\n\nOn Sunday 30 January 1972, 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights march in the [[Bogside]] area. Another 13 were wounded and one further man later died of his wounds. This event came to be known as [[Bloody Sunday (Northern Ireland 1972)|Bloody Sunday]].\n\n===The Troubles===\n{{Main|The Troubles in Derry}}\n[[File:Free Derry Corner in 1969.jpg|thumb|300px|right|\"[[Free Derry Corner]]\" at the corner of Lecky Road and Fahan Street in the Bogside. The slogan was first painted in January 1969 by John Casey.]]\nThe conflict which became known as the Troubles is widely regarded as having started in Derry with the Battle of the Bogside. The Civil Rights movement had also been very active in the city. In the early 1970s the city was heavily militarised and there was widespread civil unrest. Several districts in the city constructed barricades to control access and prevent the forces of the state from entering.\n\nViolence eased towards the end of the Troubles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Irish journalist Ed Maloney claims in \"The Secret History of the IRA\" that republican leaders there negotiated a ''de facto'' ceasefire in the city as early as 1991. Whether this is true or not, the city did see less bloodshed by this time than Belfast or other localities.\n\nThe city was visited by a [[killer whale]] in November 1977 at the height of the Troubles; it was dubbed Dopey Dick by the thousands who came from miles around to see him.<ref name=Dopey>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/radiofoyle/dopeydick/|title=A whale of a time|publisher=BBC Radio Foyle|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nFrom 1613 the city was governed by the Londonderry Corporation. In 1898 this became Londonderry County Borough Council, until 1969 when administration passed to the unelected Londonderry Development Commission. In 1973 a new district council with boundaries extending to the rural south-west was established under the name Londonderry City Council, renamed in 1984 to [[Derry City Council]], consisting of five electoral areas: Cityside, Northland, Rural, [[Shantallow]] and [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]]. The council of 30 members was re-elected every four years. As of the 2011 election, 14 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) members, ten [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], five [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), and one [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) made up the council.{{Update after|2010|11|5}} The mayor and deputy mayor were elected annually by councillors. The local authority boundaries corresponded to the [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle constituency]] of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. In [[European Parliament]] elections, it was part of the [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|Northern Ireland constituency]].\n\nThe council merged with [[Strabane District Council]] in April 2015 under local government reorganisation to become [[Derry and Strabane District Council]].\n\nThe councillors elected in 2014 for the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the centre of the cross is a gold harp.\nThe [[blazon]] of the arms is as follows:\n\n''Sable, a human skeleton Or seated upon a mossy stone proper and in dexter chief a castle triple towered argent on a chief also argent a cross gules thereon a harp or and in the first quarter a sword erect gules''<ref name=\"LP2003\">Letters Patent certifying the arms of the City of Londonderry issued to Derry City Council, sealed by Garter and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms dated 30 April 2003</ref>\n\nAccording to documents in the [[College of Arms]] in London and the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]] in Dublin, the arms of the city were confirmed in 1613 by Daniel Molyneux, [[Ulster King of Arms]].<ref name=Lacey/> The College of Arms document states that the original arms of the City of Derry were ''ye picture of death (or a skeleton) on a moissy stone & in ye dexter point a castle'' and that upon grant of a charter of incorporation and the renaming of the city as Londonderry in that year the first mayor had requested the addition of a \"chief of London\".<ref>Genealogical Office, Dublin: GO Ms 60, ''Sketches of arms by Richard Carney'', fol. 47</ref><ref>College of Arms, London: ''The Arms of Peers of Ireland and some Commoners'', fol. 133d (c.1652)</ref>\n\nTheories have been advanced as to the meaning of the \"old\" arms of Derry, before the addition of the chief bearing the arms of the City of London:\n* A suggestion has been made that the castle is related to an early 14th-century castle in nearby [[Greencastle, County Donegal|Greencastle]] belonging to the Anglo-Norman [[Earl of Ulster]] [[Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster|Richard de Burgh]].<ref name=Lacey/>\n* The most popular theory about the skeleton is that it is that of a [[Normans|Norman]] De Burgh knight who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332 on the orders of his cousin the above-mentioned [[Earl of Ulster]].<ref name=Lacey/> Another explanation put forward was that it depicted [[Cahir O'Doherty]] (Sir Charles O'Dogherty), who was put to death after Derry was invested by the English army in 1608. During the days of [[Gerrymandering]] and discrimination against the Catholic population of Derry, Derry's Roman Catholics often used to claim in dark wit that the skeleton was a local waiting for help from the council bureaucracy.<ref name=Lacey/>\n\nIn 1979, Londonderry City Council, as it was then known, commissioned a report into the city's arms and insignia, as part of the design process for an [[heraldic badge]]. The published report found that there was no basis for any of the popular explanations for the skeleton and that it was \"purely symbolic and does not refer to any identifiable person\".<ref>L E Rothwell, ''An inquiry initiated by Derry City Council into the ensigns armourial and related matters of the City of Londonderry''</ref>\n\nThe 1613 records of the arms depicted a harp in the centre of the cross, but this was omitted from later depictions of the city arms, and in the [[Letters Patent]] confirming the arms to Londonderry Corporation in 1952.<ref>Letters Patent ratifying and confirming the arms of the City of Londonderry sealed by Garter and Norroy & Ulster Kings of Arms dated 28 April 1952</ref> In 2002 Derry City Council applied to the College of Arms to have the harp restored to the city arms, and [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter]] and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy & Ulster]] Kings of Arms accepted the 17th century evidence, issuing letters patent to that effect in 2003.<ref name=\"LP2003\"/>\n\nThe motto attached to the coat of arms reads in Latin, \"Vita, Veritas, Victoria\".

The original [[walled city]] of Londonderry lies on a hill on the west bank of the River Foyle. In the past, the river branched and enclosed this wooded hill as an island; over the centuries, however, the western branch of the river dried up and became a low-lying and boggy district that is now called the Bogside.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.museumoffreederry.org/history-bogside01.html\n| title = History\u2013The Bogside\n| accessdate = 13 February 2010\n| publisher = Museum of Free Derry\n| deadurl = yes\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100325074037/http://www.museumoffreederry.org/history-bogside01.html\n| archivedate = 25 March 2010\n| df = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, modern Derry extends considerably north and west of the city walls and east of the river. The half of the city the west of the Foyle is known as the Cityside and the area east is called the [[Waterside, Derry|Waterside]]. The Cityside and Waterside are connected by the [[Craigavon Bridge]] and [[Foyle Bridge]], and by a foot bridge in the centre of the city called [[Peace Bridge (Foyle)|Peace Bridge]]. The district also extends into rural areas to the southeast of the city.\n\nThis much larger city, however, remains characterised by the often extremely steep hills that form much of its terrain on both sides of the river. A notable exception to this lies on the north-eastern edge of the city, on the shores of [[Lough Foyle]], where large expanses of sea and mudflats were reclaimed in the middle of the 19th century. Today, these [[slob lands]] are protected from the sea by miles of sea walls and dikes.

[[Mark Durkan]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) leader and Member of Parliament (MP) for Foyle was quoted in the ''Belfast Telegraph'' as saying:\n\n{{Blockquote|\nThe fact is there has been consistent under-investment in the North West and a reluctance on the part of the Civil Service to see or support anything west of the Bann, except when it comes to rate increases, then they treat us equally.\n}}\n\nIn July 2005, the Irish Minister for Finance, [[Brian Cowen]], called for a joint task force to drive economic growth in the cross border region.

This can be primarily ascribed to the formal planning of the historic walled city of Derry at the core of the modern city. This is centred on the Diamond with a collection of late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings maintaining the gridlines of the main thoroughfares (Shipquay Street, Ferryquay Street, Butcher Street and Bishop Street) to the City Gates. [[St Columb's Cathedral]] does not follow the grid pattern reinforcing its civic status. This [[Church of Ireland]] Cathedral was the first post-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] Cathedral built for an [[Anglican]] church. The construction of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[St Eugene's Cathedral]] in the Bogside in the 19th-century was another major architectural addition to the city. The Townscape Heritage Initiative has funded restoration works to key listed buildings and other older structures.\n\nIn the three centuries since their construction, the city walls have been adapted to meet the needs of a changing city. The best example of this adaptation is the insertion of three additional gates&nbsp;&ndash; Castle Gate, New Gate and Magazine Gate&nbsp;&ndash; into the walls in the course of the 19th century. Today, the fortifications form a continuous promenade around the city centre, complete with cannon, avenues of mature trees and views across Derry. Historic buildings within the city walls include St Augustine's Church, which sits on the city walls close to the site of the original monastic settlement; the copper-domed Austin's department store, which claims to the oldest such store in the world; and the imposing Greek Revival Courthouse on Bishop Street. The red-brick late-Victorian [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall]], also crowned by a copper dome, stands just beyond Shipquay Gate and close to the river front.\n\nThere are many museums and sites of interest in and around the city, including the Foyle Valley Railway Centre, the [[Amelia Earhart]] Centre And Wildlife Sanctuary, the [[Apprentice Boys of Derry|Apprentice Boys]] Memorial Hall, [[Ballyoan Cemetery]], The Bogside, numerous [[Murals#Northern Ireland murals|murals]] by the [[Bogside Artists]], Derry Craft Village, [[Free Derry Corner]], O'Doherty Tower (now home to part of the Tower Museum), the Harbour Museum, the Museum of Free Derry, Chapter House Museum, the Workhouse Museum, the [[Nerve Centre]], St. Columb's Park and Leisure Centre, [[Creggan Country Park]], [[The Millennium Forum]] and the [[Foyle Bridge|Foyle]] and [[Craigavon Bridge|Craigavon]] bridges.\n\nAttractions include museums, a vibrant shopping centre and trips to the [[Giant's Causeway]], which is approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} away, though poorly connected by public transport.

There was also a tramway on the City side of the Foyle.\n\n=====19th and 20th century growth=====\nDerry's first railway was the [[Irish gauge]] ({{RailGauge|5ft3in}}) [[Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway]] (L&ER).

This was next to Carlisle Bridge and had a junction with the LPHC railway.<ref name=Hajducki2/> The LPHC line was altered to [[dual gauge]] which allowed {{RailGauge|3ft}} gauge traffic between the Donegal Railway and L&LSR as well as Irish gauge traffic between the GNR and B&NCR. In 1906 the [[Northern Counties Committee]] (NCC, successor to the B&NCR) and the GNR jointly took over the Donegal Railway, making it the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee]] (CDRJC).\n\nThe United Kingdom Government subsidised both the L&LSR and the Donegal Railway to build long extensions into remote parts of [[County Donegal]]. By 1905 these served much of the county,<ref>Hajducki, ''op. cit.'', maps 2, 3 & 6</ref> making Derry (and also Strabane) a key rail hub for the county.\n\nThe [[City of Derry Tramways]] was opened in 1897.<ref name=HajduckiXVII>Hajducki, ''op. cit.'', page xvii</ref> This was a [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg}}) line served by [[Horsecar|horse trams]] and was never electrified.<ref name=HajduckiXVII/> The tramway had only one line, was {{convert|1.5|mi}} long, and ran along the City side of the Foyle parallel to the LPHC's line on that side of the river.<ref>Hajducki, ''op. cit.'', map 3</ref> It was closed in 1919.<ref name=HajduckiXVII/>\n\n=====20th century decline=====\nThe [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal into an international frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways' detriment and placed border posts on every line to and from Derry except the NCC route to {{rws|Coleraine}}.<ref name=Hajducki3/> The L&LSR crossed the border between Pennyburn and Bridge End, the CDRJC crossed just beyond Strabane, and the GNR line crossed twice between Derry and Strabane.<ref name=Hajducki3/> Stops for customs inspections greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping.\n\nOver the next few years customs agreements between the two states enabled GNR trains to and from Derry to pass through the Free State without inspection unless they were scheduled to serve local stations on the west bank of the Foyle, and for goods on all railways to be carried between different parts of the Free State to pass through Northern Ireland under [[Bonded warehouse|customs bond]]. However, local passenger and goods traffic continued to be delayed by customs examinations.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s and again after the Second World War the railways also faced increasing road competition. The L&LSR closed its line in 1953, followed by the CDRJC in 1954.<ref name=Hajducki39>Hajducki, ''op. cit.'', map 39</ref> The [[Ulster Transport Authority]] took over the NCC in 1949 and the GNR's lines in Northern Ireland in 1958.

It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in [[Kabul]], where he proclaimed himself the [[Shah]].\n\nDost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother's [[Qizilbash]] tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, [[Fateh Khan]]. Among the many problems he faced was repelling [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] encroachment on the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas east of the [[Khyber Pass]]. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.\n\nIn 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. [[Ranjit Singh]]'s forces occupied [[Peshawar]], moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad's forces, under the command of his son [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]], defeated the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Jamrud]], a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a [[pyrrhic victory]] and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], the new [[British Empire|British]] governor general in [[British India]], for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the [[The Great Game|Great Game]] lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India.\n\n==The Great Game==\n{{Main|The Great Game}}\n[[File:Ghazni City during 1839-42.jpg|thumb|[[Ghazni]] in early 1800s.]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] became the major power in the [[Indian subcontinent]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with [[Shah Shujah Durrani|Shuja Shah Durrani]]. It was the threat of the expanding [[Russian Empire]] beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the \"Great Game\". The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain's repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the 19th century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan's fate played out globally.\n\nThe d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the [[Hindu Kush]] area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to South Asia. In the early decades of the 19th century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the [[Iran]]ians, or the French, but from the Russians, who had already begun a steady advance southward from the [[Caucasus]] winning decisive wars against the [[Ottoman Turks]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar Persians]].\n\nAt the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in Central Asia as the British encroached northward, taking the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], and [[Kashmir]]; later to become Pakistan. The British viewed Russia's absorption of the Caucasus, the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] lands, the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Asian subcontinent.\n[[File:Lithograph of Akbar Khan in 1842.jpg|thumb|150px|Prince [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]], son of Dost Mohammad Khan.]]\n\nIn addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russia's intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take [[Herat]], historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent, [[Yan Vitkevich]], who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent [[Alexander Burnes]], for commercial discussions.\n\nThe British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawar's independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.\n\nIn 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.\n\nIt soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Auckland's plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah.\n\n==First Anglo-Afghan War, 1838\u20131842==\n{{Main|First Anglo-Afghan War}}\n[[File:Shah Shujah of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Shah Shujah Durrani|Shah Shujah]] became the last [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani ruler]], who first reigned between 1803 and 1809, and again from 1839 to 1842.]]\nTo justify his plan, the [[Governor-General of India]] Lord Auckland issued the [[Simla Manifesto]] in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on India's western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting [[Shah Shujah Durrani|Shah Shujah's]] small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shuja's rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government \"against foreign interference and factious opposition\".\n[[File:Britattack.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Ghazni]]]]\nIn November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate [[cantonments]]. The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Mohammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Mohammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars' demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by [[Ghilzai]] tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of [[Massacre of Elphinstone's Army|4,500 troops and 12,000 camp followers were killed]]. Of the British only one, Dr. [[William Brydon]], reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.\n\nAfghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]] ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass.\n\n==Mid-nineteenth century==\n[[File:Sher Ali Khan with Cd Charles Chamberlain and Sir Richard F.

Pollock in 1869.]]\n\nAfter months of chaos in Kabul, Mohammad Akbar Khan secured local control and in April 1843 his father Dost Mohammad, who had been released by the British, returned to the throne in Afghanistan. In the following decade, Dost Mohammad concentrated his efforts on reconquering Mazari Sharif, Konduz, Badakhshan, and Kandahar. Mohammad Akbar Khan died in 1845. During the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] (1848\u201349), Dost Mohammad's last effort to take Peshawar failed.\n\nBy 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855 [[Treaty of Peshawar]] reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each side's territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each other's friends and enemies of each other's enemies.\n\nIn 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar (but not Kabul) during a conflict with the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]], who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious [[sepoy]]s of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British.<ref>*{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink =Charles Allen (writer)|title=Soldier Sahibs|publisher=Abacus|year=2000|isbn=0-349-11456-0|page=283}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence. A few months later, he died. [[Sher Ali Khan]], his third son, and proclaimed successor, failed to recapture Kabul from his older brother, [[Mohammad Afzal Khan|Mohammad Afzal]] (whose troops were led by his son, [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]]) until 1868, after which Abdur Rahman retreated across the [[Amu Darya]] and bided his time.\n\nIn the years immediately following the First Anglo-Afghan War, and especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British in India, [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] governments in London took a political view of Afghanistan as a [[buffer state]]. By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of Russia, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of [[Khiva]]. Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan Emir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali.\n\n==Second Anglo-Afghan War, 1878\u20131880==\n{{See also|Second Anglo-Afghan War}}\n[[File:Mohammad Yaqub Khan with British officers in May of 1879.jpg|thumb|King [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] with Britain's [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Sir Pierre Cavagnari]] on 26 May 1879, when the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was signed.]]\n\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali tried, but failed, to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878 and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.\n[[File:Durbar Maidan of Sherpur Cantonment in 1879.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Durban Maidan of Sherpur Cantonment in 1879 near Kabul.]]\n[[File:Kandahar-1881.jpg|left|thumb|upright|British and [[Afghan National Army|allied forces]] at [[Kandahar]] after the 1880 [[Battle of Kandahar]].]]\nThe amir not only refused to receive a British mission but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the viceroy, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo-Afghan War. A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to [[Mazari Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.\n\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to the British. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and [[Michni Pass]]es, and Afghanistan ceded various [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|frontier]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and Quetta to Britain. The British army then withdrew. Soon afterwards, an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Britain's Resident in Kabul, [[Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari|Sir Pierre Cavagnari]] and his guards and staff on 3 September 1879, provoking the second phase of the Second Afghan War. Major General Sir [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] led the [[Kabul Field Force]] over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan, defeated the [[Afghan Army]] at [[Char Asiab District|Char Asiab]] on 6 October 1879 and occupied Kabul. [[Ghazi warriors|Ghazi]] Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the [[Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment]] in December 1879, but his defeat there resulted in the collapse of this rebellion.\n{{Wikisource|Treaty of Gandamak}}\n\nYaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the [[Battle of Maiwand]] in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the [[Battle of Kandahar]], bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan's foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew.\n\n==The Iron Amir, 1880\u20131901==\n[[File:Abdur Rahman Khan sitting.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (''The Iron Amir'') in 1897.]]\nAs far as British interests were concerned, [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his country's foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.\n\nHe achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the [[Ghilzai]], and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of [[Kafiristan]] north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to be eroded as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.\n\nThe Pashtuns battled and conquered the Uzbeks and forced them into the status of ruled people who were discriminated against.<ref name=\"Williams2011\">{{cite book|author=Brian Glyn Williams|title=Afghanistan Declassified: A Guide to America's Longest War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYtXJhByzoEC&pg=PA32|date=22 September 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0615-0|pages=32\u2013}}</ref> Out of anti-Russian strategic interests, the British assisted the Afghan conquest of the Uzbek Khanates, giving weapons to the Afghans and backing the [[Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan]], which involved sending massive amounts of Pashtun colonists onto Uzbek land; British literature from the period demonized the Uzbeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/from-slavers-to-warlords-descriptions-of-afghanistans-uzbeks-in-western-writing/ |title= From \u2018Slavers\u2019 to \u2018Warlords\u2019: Descriptions of Afghanistan's Uzbeks in western writing  |last1=Bleuer  |first1=Christian  |date=17 October 2014 |website=Afghanistan Analysts Network }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions making up Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized [[bureaucracy]]. Despite his distinctly [[authoritarian personality]], Abdur Rahman called for a [[loya jirga]], an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family.\n[[File:Afghanmap1893.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Maps showing the boundary of Afghanistan before the 1893 [[Durand Line]] Treaty.]]\n\nDuring his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute a Muslim Envoy to Kabul who was noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan (Saman Burj Wazirabad), a direct descendent of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri, was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.\n\nAbdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advance. He brought foreign physicians, engineers (especially for mining), geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahman's foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.\n\nThe first important frontier dispute was the [[Panjdeh]] crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the [[Merv]] (now Mary) Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the [[Panjdeh Oasis]] were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the region's Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the [[Afghan Boundary Commission|Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission]] agreed that the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya, but also involved the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.\n\nThe second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahman's reign was in the [[Wakhan]]. The British insisted that Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region, where unruly Kyrgyz held sway; he had no choice but to accept Britain's compromise. In 1895 and 1896, another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory (although the Chinese did not formally accept this as a boundary between the two countries until 1964.)\n\nFor Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India (through the Pashtun area) was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir [[Mortimer Durand]], to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts (such as [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]] and [[Chitral]]) that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.\n\nThe Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of [[demography]] or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of [[Pashtunistan]] or 'Land of the Pashtuns'. (See [[Siege of Malakand]]).\n\nThe clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son, [[Habibullah Khan]], to the throne on his father's death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control.\n\n==Habibullah Khan, 1901\u20131919==\n[[File:Habibullah Khan of Afghanistan in 1893.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Habibullah Khan]], eldest son of Abur Rahman Khan, in 1893.]]\nHabibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khan's eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his father's more distinguished wife (a granddaughter of Dost Mohammad), who sought the throne for her own son. Although made secure in his position as ruler by virtue of support from the army which was created by his father, Habibullah was not as domineering as Abdur Rahman. Consequently, the influence of religious leaders as well as that of [[Mahmud Tarzi]], a cousin of the king, increased during his reign.\n[[File:Habib Ullah 1907.jpg|left|thumb|170px|King Habibullah Khan in 1907]]\nMahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet and journalist, founded an Afghan nationalist newspaper with Habibullah's agreement, and until 1919 he used the newspaper as a platform for rebutting clerical criticism of Western-influenced changes in government and society, for espousing full Afghan independence, and for other reforms. Tarzi's passionate Afghan nationalism influenced a future generation of Asian reformers.\n\nThe boundary with Iran was firmly delineated in 1904, replacing the ambiguous line made by a British commission in 1872. Agreement could not be reached, however, on sharing the waters of the [[Helmand River]].\n\nLike all foreign policy developments of this period affecting Afghanistan, the conclusion of the \"Great Game\" between Russia and Britain occurred without the Afghan ruler's participation. The 1907 [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] (the Convention of St. Petersburg) not only divided the region into separate areas of Russian and British influence but also established foundations for Afghan neutrality. The convention provided for Russian acquiescence that Afghanistan was now outside this sphere of influence, and for Russia to consult directly with Britain on matters relating to Russian-Afghan relations. Britain, for its part, would not occupy or annex Afghan territory, or interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs.\n\nDuring World War I, Afghanistan remained neutral despite pressure to support [[Turkey]] when its sultan proclaimed his nation's participation in what it considered a holy war. Habibullah did, however, entertain an [[Niedermayer\u2013Hentig Expedition|Indo-German\u2013Turkish mission]] in Kabul in 1915 that had as its titular head the Indian nationalist [[Mahendra Pratap]] and was led by [[Oskar Niedermayer]] and the German legate [[Werner Otto von Hentig]]. After much procrastination, he won an agreement from the [[Central Powers]] for a huge payment and arms provision in exchange for attacking British India. But the crafty Afghan ruler clearly viewed the war as an opportunity to play one side off against the other, for he also offered the British to resist a Central Powers attack on India in exchange for an end to British control of Afghan foreign policy.\n\n==Third Anglo-Afghan War and Independence==<!-- This section is linked from [[Afghanistan]] -->\n{{Main|Third Anglo-Afghan War}}\n\nAmanullah's ten years of reign initiated a period of dramatic change in Afghanistan in both foreign and domestic politics. Amanullah declared full independence and sparked the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah altered foreign policy in his new relations with external powers and transformed domestic politics with his social, political, and economic reforms. Although his reign ended abruptly, he achieved some notable successes, and his efforts failed as much due to the centrifugal forces of tribal Afghanistan and the machinations of Russia and Britain as to any political folly on his part.\n\nAmanullah came to power just as the entente between Russia and Britain broke down following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. Once again Afghanistan provided a stage on which the great powers played out their schemes against one another. Keen to modernise his country and free it from foreign domination, Amanullah, sought to shore up his powerbase. Amidst intrigue in the Afghan court, and political and civil unrest in India, he sought to divert attention from the internal divisions of Afghanistan and unite all faction behind him by attacking the British.<ref>Barthorp, p. 151</ref>\n\nUsing the civil unrest in India as an excuse to move troops to the Durand Line, Afghan troops crossed the border at the western end of the Khyber Pass on 3 May 1919 and occupied the village of Bagh, the scene of an earlier uprising in April.<ref name=\"Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23\">Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23</ref> In response, the Indian government ordered a full mobilisation and on 6 May 1919 declared war. For the British it had come at a time when they were still recovering from the First World War. The troops that were stationed in India were mainly reserves and Territorials, who were awaiting demobilisation and keen to return to Britain, whilst the few regular regiments that were available were tired and depleted from five years of fighting.<ref name=\"Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23\"/>\n\nAfghan forces achieved success in the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen from both sides of the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, armoured cars, motor transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive.<ref>Barthorp, p. 152</ref>\n\nBritish forces used airpower to shock the Afghans, and the King's home was directly attacked in what is the first case of aerial bombardment in Afghanistan's history. The attacks played a key role in forcing an armistice but brought an angry rebuke from King Amanullah. He wrote: \"It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation. While we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent among all civilized people of the west\"<ref>Singer, pp. 192\u2013193</ref>\n\nThe fighting concluded in August 1919 and Britain virtually dictated the terms of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919]], a temporary armistice that provided, on one somewhat ambiguous interpretation, for Afghan self-determination in foreign affairs.<ref>Balthorp, p. 157</ref> Before final negotiations were concluded in 1921, however, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy without repercussions anyway, including diplomatic relations with the new government in the Soviet Union in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries.\n\n==Amanullah Khan, 1919\u20131929==\n{{Main|Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war}}\n[[File:King Amanullah of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]], third son of Habibullah Khan.]]\n\nOn 20 February 1919, Habibullah Khan was assassinated on a hunting trip. He had not declared a succession, but left his third son, [[Amanullah Khan]], in charge in Kabul. Amanullah did have an older brother, [[Nasrullah Khan (Afghanistan)|Nasrullah Khan]].  But, because Amanullah controlled both the national treasury and the army, Amanullah was well situated to seize power. The army's support allowed Amanullah to suppress other claims and imprison those relatives who would not swear loyalty to him. Within a few months, the new amir had gained the allegiance of most tribal leaders and established control over the cities.\n[[File:Women of Afghanistan in 1927.jpg|thumb|left|Family life of Afghan politicians in 1927.]]\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk ve Amanullah Han.jpg|thumb|left|King Amanullah in 1928, the scope of the European tour with [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] in Turkey.]]\nAmanullah Khan's reforms were heavily influenced by Europe. This came through the influence of Mahmud Tarzi, who was both Amanullah Khan's father-in-law and Foreign Minister. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet, journalist, and diplomat, was a key figure that brought Western dress and etiquette to Afghanistan. He also fought for progressive reforms such as woman's rights, educational rights, and freedom of press. All of these influences, brought by Tarzi and others, were welcomed by Amanullah Khan.\n\nIn 1926, Amanullah ended the Emirate of Afghanistan and proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan]] with himself as king. In 1927 and 1928, King Amanullah Khan and his wife [[Soraya Tarzi]] visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen of Afghanistan received honorary degrees from [[Oxford University]]. This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to modernization. King Amanullah was so impressed with the social progress of Europe that he tried to implement them right away, this met with heavy resistance from the conservative sect and eventually led to his demise.\n\nAmanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his power to modernize the country. Amanullah created new cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the region and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. He created a new capital city and increased trade with Europe and Asia. He also advanced a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms. This rapid modernization though, created a backlash, and a reactionary uprising known as the ''Khost rebellion'' which was suppressed in 1924.\n\nAfter Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927, opposition to his rule increased. An uprising in [[Jalalabad]] culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted rather than resist.  On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother, King [[Inayatullah Khan]].  On 17 January, Inayatullah abdicated and [[Habibullah Kalakani]] became the next ruler of Afghanistan and restored the emirate. However, his rule was short lived and, on 17 October 1929, Habibullah Kalakani was overthrown and replaced by King [[Nadir Khan]].\n\nAfter his abdication in 1929, Amanullah went into temporary exile in India.  When he attempted to return to Afghanistan, he had little support from the people. From India, the ex-king traveled to Europe and settled in Italy, and later in [[Switzerland]]. Meanwhile, Nadir Khan made sure his return to Afghanistan was impossible by engaging in a propaganda war. Nadir Khan accused Amanullah Khan of [[kufr]] with his pro western policies.\n\n==Mohammed Zahir Shah, 1933\u20131973==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nIn 1933, after the assassination of Nadir Khan, [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] became king.\n[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Records store.jpg|thumb|A 1950s or 1960s record store in Afghanistan, showing the increasing Western influence at the time.]] In 1940, the Afghan legation in Berlin asked that if Germany won the Second World War would the ''Reich'' give all of British India up to the Indus river to Afghanistan. Ernst von Weizsacker, the State Secretary at the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' wrote to the German minister in Kabul on 3 October 1940: <blockquote>\"The Afghan minister called on me on September 30 and conveyed greetings from his minister president, as well as their good wishes for a favourable outcome of the war.

He stated that justice for Afghanistan would be created only when the country's frontier had been extended to the Indus; this would also apply if India should secede from Britain. The Afghan remarked that Afghanistan had given proof of her loyal attitude by vigorously resisting English pressure to break off relations with Germany.\"<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Ali \t\n  | first = Tariq\n  | title = The king of Greater Afghanistan; A German dispatch from 1940 shows Zahir Shah's true colours\n  | publisher = Irish Independent \n  | date=30 November 2001| url = http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/109.html\n  | accessdate = 2016-11-29}}</ref></blockquote> No Afghan government ever accepted the [[Durand Line]] which divided the ethnically Pashtun population into the North-West Province of India (modern north-western Pakistan) and Afghanistan, and it was the hope of Kabul that if Germany won the war, than all of the Pashtun people might be united into one realm.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Ali \t\n  | first = Tariq\n  | title = The king of Greater Afghanistan; A German dispatch from 1940 shows Zahir Shah's true colours\n  | publisher = Irish Independent \n  | date=30 November 2001| url = http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/109.html\n  | accessdate = 29 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Western imperialism in Asia|Imperialism in Asia]]\n*[[Reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Vogelsang, Willem. 2002.

Over the years, the term \"dementia praecox\" was gradually replaced by \"[[schizophrenia]]\", which remains in [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|current diagnostic use]].\n\nThe term \"dementia praecox\" was first used in 1891 by [[Arnold Pick]] (1851\u20131924), a professor of psychiatry at [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t|Charles University in Prague]].{{sfn|Hoenig|1995|p=337}} His brief clinical report described the case of a person with a psychotic disorder resembling [[hebephrenia]]. German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856\u20131926) popularised it in his first detailed textbook descriptions of a condition that eventually became a different disease concept and relabeled as schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref>  Kraepelin reduced the complex psychiatric taxonomies of the nineteenth century by dividing them into two classes: manic-depressive psychosis and dementia praecox. This division, commonly referred to as the [[Kraepelinian dichotomy]], had a fundamental impact on twentieth-century psychiatry, though it has also been questioned.{{sfn|Greene|2007|p=361}}\n\nThe primary disturbance in dementia praecox was seen to be a disruption in cognitive or mental functioning in attention, memory, and goal-directed behaviour. Kraepelin contrasted this with manic-depressive psychosis, now termed [[bipolar disorder]], and also with other forms of [[mood disorder]], including [[major depressive disorder]]. He eventually concluded that it was not possible to distinguish his categories on the basis of cross-sectional symptoms.{{sfn|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=134}}\n[[File:Writing on the back of a female patient Wellcome L0040284.jpg|thumb|Writing on the back of a female patient \"DEMANCE PRECOCE\" in French is the English term \"dementia praecox\"]]\nKraepelin viewed dementia praecox as a progressively deteriorating disease from which no one recovered.  However, by 1913, and more explicitly by 1920, Kraepelin admitted that while there may be a residual cognitive defect in most cases, the prognosis was not as uniformly dire as he had stated in the 1890s. Still, he regarded it as a specific disease concept that implied incurable, inexplicable madness.\n\n==History==\n{{quote|[T]he history of dementia praecox is really that of psychiatry as a whole|Adolf Meyer{{sfn|Sass|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dwGeKBDa5-AC&pg=PA133]}}}}\n\n===First use of the term===\n[[File:Benedict-Augustin Morel (1809\u20131873).gif|left|thumb|Benedict Augustin Morel (1809\u20131873)]]\n''[[Dementia]]'' is an ancient term which has been in use since at least the time of [[Lucretius]] in 50 B.C.E. where it meant \"being out of one's mind\".<ref>{{harvnb|Berrios|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XSD_ucVR3E8C&pg=PA172 172]}}; {{harvnb|Malgorzata|2004|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Bourgeois|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PgRbFxayeQwC&pg=PA199 199]}}; {{harvnb|Adams|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rMPxSrpr9YUC&pg=PA183 183]}}</ref> Until the seventeenth century, dementia referred to states of cognitive and behavioural deterioration leading to psychosocial incompetence.

Moreover, it was now understood as an irreversible condition and a particular emphasis was placed on memory loss in regard to the deterioration of intellectual functions.{{sfn|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=117}}\n\nThe term ''d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce'' was used in passing to describe the characteristics of a subset of young mental patients by the French physician [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel|B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Augustin Morel]] in 1852 in the first volume of his ''\u00c9tudes cliniques.''<ref>{{harvnb|Hoenig|1995|p=337}}; {{harvnb|Boyle|2002|p=46}}. Berrios, Luque and Villagran contend in their 2003 article on schizophrenia that Morel's first use dates to the publication in 1860 of ''Trait\u00e9 des maladies mentales'' ({{harvnb|Berrios|Luque|Villagran2003|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Morel|1860}}). Dowbiggin inaccurately states that Morel used the term on page 234 of the first volume of his 1852 publication ''Etudes cliniques'' ({{harvnb|Dowbiggin|1996|p=388}}; {{harvnb|Morel|1852|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA234 234]}}). On page 235] Morel does refer to ''d\u00e9mence juv\u00e9nile'' in positing that senility is not an age specific affliction and he also remarks that at his clinic he sees almost as many young people suffering from senility as old people ({{harvnb|Morel|1852|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA235 235]}}). Also, as Hoenig accurately states, Morel uses the term twice in his 1852 text on pages 282 and 361 ({{harvnb|Hoenig|1995|p=337}}; {{harvnb|Morel|1852|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA282 282], [https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA361 361]}}). In the first instance the reference is made in relation to young girls of asthenic build who have often also suffered from typhoid. It is a description and not a diagnostic category ({{harvnb|Morel|1852|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA282 282]}}). In the next instance the term is used to argue that the illness course for those who suffer mania does not normally terminate in an early form of dementia ({{harvnb|Morel|1852|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n9hEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad&pg=PA361 361]}}).</ref> and the term is used more frequently in his textbook ''Trait\u00e9 des maladies mentales'' which was published in 1860.<ref>{{harvnb|Berrios|Luque|Villagran2003|p=117}}. The term ''D\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce'' is used by Morel once in his 1857 text ''Trait\u00e9 des d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence physiques, intellectuelles, et morales de l'esp\u00e8ce humaine'' ({{harvnb|Morel|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lu85F4UGpT0C&pg=PA391 391]}}) and seven times in his 1860 book ''Trait\u00e9 des maladies mentales'' ({{harvnb|Morel|1860|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119 119], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279 279], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA516 516], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA526 526], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA532 532], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA536 536], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yp8_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA552 552]}}).</ref> Morel, whose name will be forever associated with religiously inspired concept of [[degeneration|degeneration theory]] in psychiatry, used the term in a descriptive sense and not to define a specific and novel diagnostic category. It was applied as a means of setting apart a group of young men and women who were suffering from \"stupor.\"{{sfn|Dowbiggin|1996|p=388}} As such their condition was characterised by a certain torpor, enervation, and disorder of the will and was related to the diagnostic category of [[melancholia]]. He did not conceptualise their state as irreversible and thus his use of the term dementia was equivalent to that formed in the eighteenth century as outlined above.{{sfn|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=118}}\n\nWhile some have sought to interpret, if in a qualified fashion, the use by Morel of the term ''d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce''  as amounting to the \"discovery\" of schizophrenia,{{sfn|Dowbiggin|1996|p=388}} others have argued convincingly that Morel's descriptive use of the term should not be considered in any sense as a precursor to Kraepelin's dementia praecox disease concept.{{sfn|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=117}} This is due to the fact that their concepts of dementia differed significantly from each other, with Kraepelin employing the more modern sense of the word and that Morel was not describing a diagnostic category. Indeed, until the advent of Pick and Kraepelin, Morel's term had vanished without a trace and there is little evidence to suggest that either Pick or indeed Kraepelin were even aware of Morel's use of the term until long after they had published their own disease concepts bearing the same name.<ref>While Berrios, Luque and Villagran argue this point forcefully ({{harvnb|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=117}}), others baldly state that Kraepelin was clearly inspired by Morel's lead. Yet no evidence of this claim is offered. For example, {{harvnb|Stone|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bk4IPCprqicC&pg=PA1 1]}}.</ref> As Eug\u00e8ne Minkowski succinctly stated, 'An abyss separates Morel's d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce from that of Kraepelin.'<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Berrios|Luque|Villagran|2003|p=117}}.</ref>\n\nMorel described several psychotic disorders that ended in dementia, and as a result he may be regarded as the first alienist or psychiatrist to develop a diagnostic system based on presumed outcome rather than on the current presentation of signs and symptoms. Morel, however, did not conduct any [[long-term]] or [[quantitative research]] on the course and outcome of dementia praecox (Kraepelin would be the first in history to do that) so this prognosis was based on speculation. It is impossible to discern whether the condition briefly described by Morel was equivalent to the disorder later called dementia praecox by Pick and Kraepelin.\n\n===Time component===\n[[File:Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum.JPG|thumb|right|[[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]] (1828\u20131899)]]\nPsychiatric [[nosology]] in the nineteenth-century was chaotic and characterised by a conflicting mosaic of contradictory systems.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraam|2008|p=77}}; {{harvnb|Jablensky|1999|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Scharfetter|2001|p=[http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2001/2001-01/2001-01-058.PDF 34]}}; {{harvnb|Engstrom|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C1JYNnBLMqQC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> Psychiatric disease categories were based upon short-term and [[cross-sectional]] observations of patients from which were derived the putative characteristic [[medical sign|signs]] and [[symptoms]] of a given disease concept.<ref>{{harvnb|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA145 145]}}; {{harvnb|Hoenig|1995|pp=337\u20138}}; {{harvnb|Kraam|2009|p=88}}</ref> The dominant psychiatric paradigms which gave a semblance of order to this fragmentary picture were Morelian degeneration theory and the concept of \"[[unitary psychosis]]\" (''Einheitspsychose'').<ref>{{harvnb|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA145 145]}}; {{harvnb|Engstrom|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C1JYNnBLMqQC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> This latter notion, derived from the Belgian psychiatrist [[Joseph Guislain]] (1797\u20131860), held that the variety of symptoms attributed to mental illness were manifestations of a single underlying disease process.<ref>{{harvnb|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA145 145]}}</ref> While these approaches had a diachronic aspect they lacked a conception of mental illness that encompassed a coherent notion of change over time in terms of the natural course of the illness and based upon an empirical observation of changing symptomatology.{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA242 242]}}\n\nIn 1863, the [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]-based psychiatrist [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]] (1828\u20131899) published his text on psychiatric nosology ''Die Gruppierung der psychischen Krankheiten'' (''The Classification of Psychiatric Diseases'').<ref>{{harvnb|Engstrom|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C1JYNnBLMqQC&pg=PA263 263]}}; {{harvnb|Pillmann|Marneros|2003|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Kahlbaum|1863}}</ref> Although with the passage of time this work would prove profoundly influential, when it was published it was almost completely ignored by German academia despite the sophisticated and intelligent disease classification system which it proposed.{{sfn|Kraam|2009|p=87}} In this book Kahlbaum categorized certain typical forms of psychosis (''vesania typica'') as a single coherent type based upon their shared progressive nature which betrayed, he argued, an ongoing degenerative disease process.<ref>{{harvnb|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA242 242]}}; {{harvnb|Pillmann|Marneros|2003|p=163}}</ref> For Kahlbaum the disease process of ''vesania typica'' was distinguished by the passage of the sufferer through clearly defined disease phases: a melancholic stage; a manic stage; a confusional stage; and finally a demented stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraam|2009|p=105}}; {{harvnb|Kahlbaum|1863|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zYY_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA135 135]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1866 Kahlbaum became the director of a private psychiatric clinic in [[G\u00f6rlitz]] ([[Prussia]], today [[Saxony]], a small town near [[Dresden]]). He was accompanied by his younger assistant, [[Ewald Hecker]] (1843\u20131909), and during a ten-year collaboration they conducted a series of [[research]] studies on young psychotic patients that would become a major influence on the development of modern psychiatry.\n\nTogether Kahlbaum and Hecker were the first to describe and name such [[syndrome]]s as [[dysthymia]], [[cyclothymia]], [[paranoia]], [[catatonia]], and [[hebephrenia]].{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=512}} Perhaps their most lasting contribution to psychiatry was the introduction of the \"clinical method\" from medicine to the study of mental diseases, a method which is now known as [[psychopathology]].\n\nWhen the element of time was added to the concept of [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], a diagnosis became more than just a description of a collection of symptoms: diagnosis now also defined by [[prognosis]] (course and outcome). An additional feature of the clinical method was that the characteristic symptoms that define syndromes should be described without any prior assumption of brain pathology (although such links would be made later as scientific knowledge progressed). Karl Kahlbaum made an appeal for the adoption of the clinical method in psychiatry in his 1874 book on catatonia. Without Kahlbaum and Hecker there would be no dementia praecox.{{sfn|Hoenig|1995|pp=337\u20138}}\n\nUpon his appointment to a full professorship in psychiatry at the University of Dorpat (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]) in 1886, Kraepelin gave an inaugural address to the faculty outlining his research programme for the years ahead. Attacking the \"brain mythology\" of [[Theodor Meynert|Meynert]] and the positions of [[Wilhelm Griesinger|Griesinger]] and [[Bernhard von Gudden|Gudden]], [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] advocated that the ideas of Kahlbaum, who was then a marginal and little known figure in psychiatry, should be followed. Therefore, he argued, a research programme into the nature of psychiatric illness should look at a large number of patients over time to discover the course which mental disease could take.{{sfn|Steinberger|Angermeyer|2001|pp=297\u2013327}} It has also been suggested that Kraepelin's decision to accept the Dorpat post was informed by the fact that there he could hope to gain experience with chronic patients and this, it was presumed, would facilitate the longitudinal study of mental illness.{{sfn|Berrios|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XSD_ucVR3E8C&pg=PA23 23]}}\n\n===Quantitative component===\nUnderstanding that objective diagnostic methods must be based on scientific practice, Kraepelin had been conducting psychological and drug experiments on patients and normal subjects for some time when, in 1891, he left Dorpat and took up a position as professor and director of the psychiatric clinic at [[Heidelberg University]]. There he established a research program based on Kahlbaum's proposal for a more exact qualitative clinical approach, and his own innovation: a quantitative approach involving meticulous collection of data over time on each new patient admitted to the clinic (rather than only the interesting cases, as had been the habit until then).\n\nKraepelin believed that by thoroughly describing all of the clinic's new patients on index cards, which he had been using since 1887, [[researcher]] bias could be eliminated from the investigation process.{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PR14 xiv]}} He described the method in his posthumously published memoir:\n{{quote|... after the first thorough examination of a new patient, each of us had to throw in a note [in a \"diagnosis box\"] with his diagnosis written on it. After a while, the notes were taken out of the box, the diagnoses were listed, and the case was closed, the final interpretation of the disease was added to the original diagnosis. In this way, we were able to see what kind of mistakes had been made and were able to follow-up the reasons for the wrong original diagnosis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraepelin|1987|p=61}}</ref>}}\n\nThe fourth edition of his textbook, ''Psychiatrie'', published in 1893, two years after his arrival at Heidelberg, contained some impressions of the patterns Kraepelin had begun to find in his index cards. Prognosis (course and outcome) began to feature alongside signs and symptoms in the description of syndromes, and he added a class of psychotic disorders designated \"psychic degenerative processes\", three of which were borrowed from Kahlbaum and Hecker: ''dementia paranoides'' (a degenerative type of Kahlbaum's paranoia, with sudden onset), ''catatonia'' (per Kahlbaum, 1874) and ''dementia praecox'', (Hecker's hebephrenia of 1871). Kraepelin continued to equate dementia praecox with hebephrenia for the next six years.{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PR14 xiv]}}\n\nIn the March 1896 fifth edition of ''Psychiatrie'', Kraepelin expressed confidence that his [[clinical trial|clinical]] [[scientific method|method]], involving analysis of both [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] data derived from long term observation of patients, would produce reliable diagnoses including prognosis:\n{{quote|What convinced me of the superiority of the clinical method of diagnosis (followed here) over the traditional one, was the certainty with which we could predict (in conjunction with our new concept of disease) the future course of events.

Dementia praecox was characterized by disordered intellectual functioning, whereas manic-depressive illness was principally a disorder of affect or mood; and the former featured constant deterioration, virtually no recoveries and a poor outcome, while the latter featured periods of exacerbation followed by periods of remission, and many complete recoveries. The class, dementia praecox, comprised the paranoid, catatonic and hebephrenic psychotic disorders, and these forms were found in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] until the fifth edition was released, in May 2013. These terms, however, are still found in general psychiatric nomenclature. The [[ICD-10]] still uses \"hebephrenic\" to designate the third type.{{sfn|American Psychiatric Association|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&pg=PA303 303]}}\n\n===Change in prognosis===\nIn the seventh, 1904, edition of ''Psychiatrie'', Kraepelin accepted the possibility that a small number of patients may recover from dementia praecox. [[Eugen Bleuler]] reported in 1908 that in many cases there was no inevitable progressive decline, there was temporary remission in some cases, and there were even cases of near recovery with the retention of some residual defect. In the eighth edition of Kraepelin's textbook, published in four volumes between 1909 and 1915, he described eleven forms of dementia, and dementia praecox was classed as one of the \"endogenous dementias\". Modifying his previous more gloomy prognosis in line with Bleuler's observations, Kraepelin reported that about 26% of his patients experienced partial remission of symptoms. Kraepelin died while working on the ninth edition of ''Psychiatrie'' with Johannes Lange (1891\u20131938), who finished it and brought it to publication in 1927.<ref>{{harvnb|Noll|2007a|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA126 126\u20137]}}</ref>\n\n===Cause===\nThough his work and that of his research associates had revealed a role for heredity, Kraepelin realized nothing could be said with certainty about the aetiology of dementia praecox, and he left out speculation regarding brain disease or neuropathology in his diagnostic descriptions. Nevertheless, from the 1896 edition onwards Kraepelin made clear his belief that poisoning of the brain, \"auto-intoxication,\" probably by sex hormones, may underlie dementia praecox&nbsp;\u2013 a theory also entertained by Eugen Bleuler. Both theorists insisted dementia praecox is a biological disorder, not the product of psychological trauma. Thus, rather than a disease of hereditary degeneration or of structural brain pathology, Kraepelin believed dementia praecox was due to a systemic or \"whole body\" disease process, probably metabolic, which gradually affected many of the tissues and organs of the body before affecting the brain in a final, decisive cascade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Noll|first=Richard|title=Whole Body Madness|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/2104852|publisher=Psychiatric times|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>  Kraepelin, recognizing dementia praecox in Chinese, Japanese, Tamil and Malay patients, suggested in the eighth edition of ''Psychiatrie'' that, \"we must therefore seek the real cause of dementia praecox in conditions which are spread all over the world, which thus do not lie in race or in climate, in food or in any other general circumstance of life...\"{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA127 127]}}\n\n===Treatment===\nKraepelin had experimented with hypnosis but found it wanting, and disapproved of Freud's and Jung's introduction, based on no evidence, of psychogenic assumptions to the interpretation and treatment of mental illness. He argued that, without knowing the underlying cause of dementia praecox or manic-depressive illness, there could be no disease-specific treatment, and recommended the use of long baths and the occasional use of drugs such as opiates and barbiturates for the amelioration of distress, as well as occupational activities, where suitable, for all institutionalized patients. Based on his theory that dementia praecox is the product of autointoxication emanating from the sex glands, Kraepelin experimented, without success, with injections of thyroid, gonad and other glandular extracts.{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA127 127]}}\n\n===Use of term spreads===\n[[File:Cartoon by Emil Kraepelin.jpg|right|thumb|\"Psychiatrists of Europe! Protect your sanctified diagnoses!\" A satirizing cartoon by Emil Kraepelin based on [[:de:V\u00f6lker Europas, wahrt eure heiligsten G\u00fcter|a famous contemporary political painting]].]]\nKraepelin noted the dissemination of his new disease concept when in 1899 he enumerated the term's appearance in almost twenty articles in the German-language medical press.{{sfn| Noll| 2007a|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA127 127]}} In the early years of the twentieth century the twin pillars of the Kraepelinian dichotomy, dementia praecox and manic depressive psychosis, were assiduously adopted in clinical and research contexts among the Germanic psychiatric community.{{sfn|Noll|2007a|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzoJxps189IC&pg=PA127 127]}} German-language psychiatric concepts were always introduced much faster in America (than, say, Britain) where \u00e9migr\u00e9 German, Swiss and Austrian physicians essentially created American psychiatry. Swiss-\u00e9migr\u00e9 Adolf Meyer (1866\u20131950), arguably the most influential psychiatrist in America for the first half of the 20th century, published the first critique of dementia praecox in an 1896 book review of the 5th edition of Kraepelin's textbook. But it was not until 1900 and 1901 that the first three American publications regarding dementia praecox appeared, one of which was a translation of a few sections of Kraepelin's 6th edition of 1899 on dementia praecox.\n\nAdolf Meyer was the first to apply the new diagnostic term in America. He used it at the Worcester Lunatic Hospital in Massachusetts in the fall of 1896. He was also the first to apply Eugen Bleuler's term \"schizophrenia\" (in the form of \"schizophrenic reaction\") in 1913 at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nThe dissemination of Kraepelin's disease concept to the Anglophone world was facilitated in 1902 when Ross Diefendorf, a lecturer in psychiatry at Yale, published an adapted version of the sixth edition of the ''Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie''. This was republished in 1904 and with a new version, based on the seventh edition of Kraepelin's ''Lehrbuch'' appearing in 1907 and reissued in 1912.{{Sfn |Dain|1980|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OJMgz7cJjLcC&pg=PA34 34], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OJMgz7cJjLcC&pg=PA341 341 n. 38]}}{{Sfn |Diefendorf|1912|pp=219\u201375}}  Both dementia praecox (in its three classic forms) and \"manic-depressive psychosis\" gained wider popularity in the larger institutions in the eastern United States after being included in the official nomenclature of diseases and conditions for record-keeping at Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1903.  The term lived on due to its promotion in the publications of the National Committee on Mental Hygiene (founded in 1909) and the Eugenics Records Office (1910). But perhaps the most important reason for the longevity of Kraepelin's term was its inclusion in 1918 as an official diagnostic category in the uniform system adopted for comparative statistical record-keeping in all American mental institutions, ''The Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane''. Its many revisions served as the official diagnostic classification scheme in America until 1952 when the first edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: Mental Disorders'', or DSM-I, appeared. Dementia praecox disappeared from official psychiatry with the publication of DSM-I, replaced by the Bleuler/Meyer hybridization, \"schizophrenic reaction\".\n\nSchizophrenia was mentioned as an alternate term for dementia praecox in the 1918 ''Statistical Manual''. In both clinical work as well as research, between 1918 and 1952 five different terms were used interchangeably: dementia praecox, schizophrenia, dementia praecox (schizophrenia), schizophrenia (dementia praecox) and schizophrenic reaction. This made the psychiatric literature of the time confusing since, in a strict sense, Kraepelin's disease was not Bleuler's disease. They were defined differently, had different population parameters, and different concepts of prognosis.\n\nThe reception of dementia praecox as an accepted diagnosis in British psychiatry came more slowly, perhaps only taking hold around the time of World War I. There was substantial opposition to the use of the term \"dementia\" as misleading, partly due to findings of remission and recovery. Some argued that existing diagnoses such as \"delusional insanity\" or \"adolescent insanity\" were better or more clearly defined.<ref>{{harvnb|Ion|Beer|2002a|pp=285\u2013304}}; {{harvnb|Ion|Beer|2002b|pp=419\u201331}}</ref> In France a psychiatric tradition regarding the psychotic disorders predated Kraepelin, and the French never fully adopted Kraepelin's classification system. Instead the French maintained an independent classification system throughout the 20th century. From 1980, when DSM-III totally reshaped psychiatric diagnosis, French psychiatry began to finally alter its views of diagnosis to converge with the North American system. Kraepelin thus finally conquered France via America.\n\n==From dementia praecox to schizophrenia==\nDue to the influence of alienists such as Adolf Meyer, August Hoch, George Kirby, Charles Macphie Campbell, Smith Ely Jelliffe and William Alanson White, psychogenic theories of dementia praecox dominated the American scene by 1911. In 1925 Bleuler's schizophrenia rose in prominence as an alternative to Kraepelin's dementia praecox. When Freudian perspectives became influential in American psychiatry in the 1920s schizophrenia became an attractive alternative concept. Bleuler corresponded with Freud and was connected to Freud's psychoanalytic movement,<ref>Makari, George.  Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis, Harper Perennial: New York, 2008.</ref> and the inclusion of Freudian interpretations of the symptoms of schizophrenia in his publications on the subject, as well as those of C.G. Jung, eased the adoption of his broader version of dementia praecox (schizophrenia) in America over Kraepelin's narrower and prognostically more negative one.\n\nThe term \"schizophrenia\" was first applied by American alienists and neurologists in private practice by 1909 and officially in institutional settings in 1913, but it took many years to catch on. It is first mentioned in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1925. Until 1952 the terms dementia praecox and schizophrenia were used interchangeably in American psychiatry, with occasional use of the hybrid terms \"dementia praecox (schizophrenia)\" or \"schizophrenia (dementia praecox)\".\n\n==Diagnostic manuals==\nEditions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders since the first in 1952 had reflected views of schizophrenia as \"reactions\" or \"psychogenic\" (DSM-I), or as manifesting Freudian notions of \"defense mechanisms\" (as in DSM-II of 1969 in which the symptoms of schizophrenia were interpreted as \"psychologically self-protected\"). The diagnostic criteria were vague, minimal and wide, including either concepts that no longer exist or that are now labeled as personality disorders (for example, schizotypal personality disorder). There was also no mention of the dire prognosis Kraepelin had made. Schizophrenia seemed to be more prevalent and more psychogenic and more treatable than either Kraepelin or Bleuler would have allowed.\n\n==Conclusions==\nAs a direct result of the effort to construct [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] (RDC) in the 1970s that were independent of any clinical diagnostic manual, Kraepelin's idea that categories of mental disorder should reflect discrete and specific disease entities with a biological basis began to return to prominence. Vague dimensional approaches based on symptoms\u2014so highly favored by the Meyerians and psychoanalysts\u2014were overthrown. For research purposes, the definition of schizophrenia returned to the narrow range allowed by Kraepelin's dementia praecox concept. Furthermore, after 1980 the disorder was a progressively deteriorating one once again, with the notion that recovery, if it happened at all, was rare. This revision of schizophrenia became the basis of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-III (1980). Some of the psychiatrists who worked to bring about this revision referred to themselves as the \"neo-Kraepelinians\".\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Adams|first=Trevor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMPxSrpr9YUC&pg=PA183&lpg=PA183&dq=lucretius+dementia#v=onepage&q=lucretius%20dementia&f=false|chapter=Dementia|editor=Norman, Ian J. |editor2=Redfern, Sally J.|title=Mental Health Care for Elderly People|location=London|year=1997|pages=183\u2013204|isbn=9780443051739}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=American Psychiatric Association|year=2000|title=DSM-IV-TR: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders|edition=4th|publisher=American Psychiatric Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC}}\n* {{cite web|ref=harv |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=411 |title=B00 Schizophrenia: Proposed Revision |author=American Psychiatric Association |authorlink= |author2= |year=2011 |work=DSM-5 Development |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225141148/http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=411 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |df= }}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Berrios|first1= German E.|authorlink=G.

They are an informal grouping within the order [[Cetacea]], excluding [[whale]]s and [[porpoise]]s, so to zoologists the grouping is [[paraphyletic]]. The dolphins comprise the extant families [[Delphinidae]] (the oceanic dolphins), [[Platanistidae]] (the Indian [[river dolphin]]s), [[Iniidae]] (the new world river dolphins), and [[Pontoporiidae]] (the [[brackish]] dolphins), and the extinct [[Lipotidae]] (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other [[cetaceans]], belong to the clade [[Cetartiodactyla]] with [[even-toed ungulate]]s. Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the [[hippopotamus]]es, having diverged about 40 million years ago.\n\nDolphins range in size from the {{convert|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|50|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|9.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|MT|ST|abbr=on}} [[killer whale]]. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, some dolphins can travel at {{convert|55.5|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\n\nAlthough dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the [[right whale dolphin]], prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\n\nDolphins are sometimes hunted in places like Japan, in an activity known as [[dolphin drive hunting]]. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from [[bycatch]], habitat loss, and [[marine pollution]]. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series [[Free Willy (film series)|''Free Willy'']]. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species kept is the [[bottlenose dolphin]], while there are around 60 [[captive killer whales]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is originally from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2}} (''delph\u00eds''), \"dolphin\",<ref name=Liddel>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddelfi%2Fs|title=\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2 |first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}</ref> which was related to the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2}} (''delphus''), \"womb\".<ref name=Liddel/> The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning \"a 'fish' with a womb\".<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Dolphin\n|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n|edition=Fourth\n|publisher=[[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]\n|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Dolphin\n|accessdate= December 17, 2006}}</ref> The name was transmitted via the [[Latin]] ''delphinus''<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Ddelphinus delphinus],\nCharlton T.

As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells.

Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See [[cetacean intelligence]] for more details.\n\n===Socialization===\n[[File:Dolphinsurfresize.jpg|thumb|Dolphins surfing at [[Snapper Rocks]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]]]\nDolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a ''superpod''; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.<ref>{{cite web\n|title= Bottlenose Dolphins \u2013 Altruism\n|author=Davidson College, biology department\n|year=2001\n|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/behavior/Spring2001/Ewart/Altruism.html\n|accessdate= March 12, 2008\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100106122007/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/behavior/Spring2001/Ewart/Altruism.html\n|archivedate = January 6, 2010\n|deadurl = yes\n}}</ref> This [[altruism]] does not appear to be limited to their own species.

Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/4272-elephant-awareness-mirrors-humans.html | title=Elephant Self-Awareness Mirrors Humans |publisher=Live Science |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\nThe most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the [[mirror test]] in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; they then see if the animal shows signs of self-recognition.<ref name=\"Mirror test\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.<ref name=\"Mirror test\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1026|pages=205\u2013224|pmid=8521259}}</ref> They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin.

Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Of Truth For US Dolphin Safe Logos |url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |website=atuna |accessdate=29 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015221118/http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df= }}</ref>\nLoud underwater noises, such as those resulting from [[navy|naval]] [[sonar]] use, live firing exercises, and certain [[offshore construction]] projects such as [[wind farm]]s, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing [[decompression sickness]] by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.<ref>{{cite news\n|title= Navy sonar may be killing whales, dolphins\n|author=CBC news\n|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2003/10/09/sonar031009.html\n|accessdate= October 27, 2008\n|work=CBC News\n|date=2003-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Npower renewables Underwater noise & vibration, section 9.4\n|url=http://www.natwindpower.co.uk/northhoyle/pdfs/fepa/chapter9.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722160651/http://www.natwindpower.co.uk/northhoyle/pdfs/fepa/chapter9.pdf\n|archivedate=2007-07-22\n|accessdate= October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]], and [[Japan]], the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium]]s.

Dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry.\n\nIn [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the [[Minoans]], judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at [[Knossos]]. During the 2009 excavations of a major [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] city at [[Iklaina]], a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins.

A dolphin rescued the poet [[Arion]] from drowning and carried him safe to land, at [[Cape Matapan]], a promontory forming the southernmost point of the [[Peloponnesus]]. There was a temple to [[Poseidon]] and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.<ref>[[Herodotus]] I.23; [[Thucydides]] I.128, 133; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii.25, 4</ref>\n\nThe Greeks reimagined the [[Phoenicia]]n god [[Melqart]] as Melikert\u00eas ([[Melicertes]]) and made him the son of [[Athamas]] and [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]]. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became [[Leucothea]]. (''cf'' [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]].) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the [[Isthmian Games]], originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of [[Melicertes]]. [[Phalanthus of Tarentum|Phalanthus]] was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].\n\n[[Dionysus]] was once captured by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[pirate]]s who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and [[shapeshifting|transformed]] them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both [[Aphrodite]] and [[Apollo]].\n\nWhen heraldry developed in the [[Middle Ages]], not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with [[fish scale]]s.\n\nDolphins are present in the [[coat of arms of Anguilla]] and the [[coat of arms of Romania]],<ref name=\"Hentea2007\">{{cite book|last=Hentea|first=C\u0103lin|title=Brief Romanian Military History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lwcWDFZWuJgC}}|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5820-6}}</ref> and the [[coat of arms of Barbados]] has a dolphin [[supporter]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|last=Ali|first=Arif|year=1996|page=16|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3|publisher=Hansib Publications|location=Hertford, UK}}</ref><ref name=\"Ali1996\">{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Arif|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0k8sAQAAMAAJ|page=16}}|year=1996|page=16|publisher=Hansib|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3}}</ref>\n\nA well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the former province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in southern France, from which were derived the arms and the title of the [[Dauphin of France]], the heir to the former throne of France (the title literally means \"The Dolphin of France\").\n\n\"Dolfin\" was the name of an aristocratic family in the maritime [[Republic of Venice]], whose most prominent member was the 13th Century [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Giovanni Dolfin]].\n\nIn [[Hindu mythology]] the [[Ganges River Dolphin]] is associated with [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]], the deity of the [[Ganges]] river.

Specifically, it is a [[zero ring|nonzero]] ring<ref>In this article, rings have a 1.</ref> in which every nonzero element {{mvar|a}} has a [[multiplicative inverse]], i.e., an element {{mvar|x}} with {{math|1=''a''\u00b7''x'' = ''x''\u00b7''a'' = 1.}} Stated differently, a ring is a division ring if and only if the [[group of units]] equals the set of all nonzero elements.  A division ring is a type of [[noncommutative ring]] under the looser definition where ''noncommutative ring'' refers to rings which are not ''necessarily'' commutative.\n\nDivision rings differ from [[field (mathematics)|fields]] only in that their multiplication is not required to be [[commutative]]. However, by [[Wedderburn's little theorem]] all finite division rings are commutative and therefore [[finite field]]s. Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called \"commutative fields\".{{refn|Within the English language area the terms \"skew field\" and \"sfield\" were mentioned 1948 by Neal McCoy <ref>1948, Rings and Ideals. Northampton, Mass., Mathematical Association of America</ref> as \"sometimes used in the literature\", and since 1965 ''skewfield'' has an entry in the [[OED]]. The German term [[:de:Schiefk\u00f6rper]] is documented, as a suggestion by [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|v.d.&nbsp;Waerden]], in a 1927 text by [[Emil Artin|E.&nbsp;Artin]]<ref>Artin, Emil, 1965: Collected Papers. Edited by Serge Lang, John T. Tate. New York et al.: Springer</ref>, and was used by [[Emmy Noether|E.&nbsp;Noether]] as lecture title in 1928.<ref>Brauer, Richard, 1932: \u00dcber die algebraische Struktur von Schiefk\u00f6rpern. Journal\nf\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik 166.4, 103-252</ref>}}\n\nAll division rings are simple, i.e. have no two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] besides the [[zero ideal]] and itself.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}\n\n==Relation to fields and linear algebra==\nAll fields are division rings; more interesting examples are the non-commutative division rings. The best known example is the ring of [[quaternion]]s '''H'''. If we allow only [[rational number|rational]] instead of [[real number|real]] coefficients in the constructions of the quaternions, we obtain another division ring. In general, if ''R'' is a ring and ''S'' is a [[simple module]] over ''R'', then, by [[Schur's lemma]], the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''S'' is a division ring;<ref>Lam (2001), {{Google books|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=33|text=Schur's Lemma|title=Schur's Lemma}}.</ref> every division ring arises in this fashion from some simple module.\n\nMuch of [[linear algebra]] may be formulated, and remains correct, for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a division ring ''D'' instead of [[vector space]]s over a field. Doing so it must be specified whether one is considering right or left modules, and some care is needed in properly distinguishing left and right in formulas. Working in coordinates, elements of a finite dimensional right module can be represented by column vectors, which can be multiplied on the right by scalars, and on the left by matrices (representing linear maps); for elements of a finite dimensional left module, row vectors must be used, which can be multiplied on the left by scalars, and on the right by matrices. The dual of a right module is a left module, and vice versa. The transpose of a matrix must be viewed as a matrix over the opposite division ring ''D''<sup>op</sup> in order for the rule {{math|(''AB'')<sup>T</sup> {{=}} ''B''<sup>T</sup>''A''<sup>T</sup>}} to remain valid.\n\nEvery module over a division ring is [[free module|free]]; i.e., has a basis, and all bases of a module [[Invariant basis number|have the same number of elements]]. Linear maps between finite-dimensional modules over a division ring can be described by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]; the fact that linear maps by definition commute with scalar multiplication is most conveniently represented in notation by writing them on the ''opposite'' side of vectors as scalars are. The [[Gaussian elimination]] algorithm remains applicable. The column rank of a matrix is the dimension of the right module generated by the columns, and the row rank is dimension of the left module generated by the rows; the same proof as for the vector space case can be used to show that these ranks are the same, and define the rank of a matrix.\n\nIn fact the converse is also true and this gives a ''characterization of division rings'' via their module category:  A unital ring ''R'' is a division ring if and only if every R-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] is [[Free module|free]].<ref>Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007; a proof can be found [http://planetmath.org/ringswhoseeverymoduleisfree here]''</ref>\n\nThe [[center of a ring|center]] of a division ring is commutative and therefore a field.<ref>Simple commutative rings are fields. See Lam (2001), {{Google books|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=39|text=simple commutative rings|title=simple commutative rings}} and {{Google books|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=45|text=center of a simple ring|title=exercise 3.4}}.</ref> Every division ring is therefore a [[division algebra]] over its center. Division rings can be roughly classified according to whether or not they are finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional over their centers. The former are called ''centrally finite'' and the latter ''centrally infinite''. Every field is, of course, one-dimensional over its center. The ring of [[Hamiltonian quaternions]] forms a 4-dimensional algebra over its center, which is isomorphic to the real numbers.\n\n==Examples==\n* As noted above, all [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] are division rings.\n* The [[quaternion]]s form a noncommutative division ring.\n* The subset of the quaternions {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}}, such that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, and {{mvar|d}} belong to a fixed subfield of the [[real number]]s, is a noncommutative division ring. When this subfield is the field of [[rational number]]s, this is the division ring of ''rational quaternions''.\n* Let <math>\\sigma:\\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}</math> be an [[automorphism]] of the field <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.  Let <math>\\mathbb{C}((z,\\sigma))</math> denote the ring of [[formal Laurent series]] with complex coefficients, wherein multiplication is defined as follows:  instead of simply allowing coefficients to commute directly with the indeterminate <math>z</math>, for <math>\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>, define <math>z^i\\alpha:=\\sigma^i(\\alpha)z^i</math> for each index <math>i\\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>.  If <math>\\sigma</math> is a non-trivial automorphism of [[complex number]]s (such as [[complex conjugate|the conjugation]]), then the resulting ring of Laurent series is a strictly noncommutative division ring known as a ''skew Laurent series ring'';<ref>Lam (2001), p. 10</ref> if {{math|1=''&sigma;'' = [[identity function|id]]}} then it features the [[ring of formal Laurent series|standard multiplication of formal series]]. This concept can be generalized to the ring of Laurent series over any fixed field <math>F</math>, given a nontrivial <math>F</math>-automorphism <math>\\sigma</math>.\n\n==Main theorems==\n'''[[Wedderburn's little theorem]]''': All finite division rings are commutative and therefore [[finite field]]s. ([[Ernst Witt]] gave a simple proof.)\n\n'''[[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|Frobenius theorem]]''': The only finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the reals are the reals themselves, the [[complex number]]s, and the [[quaternion]]s.\n\n==Related notions==\nDivision rings ''used to be'' called \"fields\" in an older usage. In many languages, a word meaning \"body\" is used for division rings, in some languages designating either commutative or non-commutative division rings, while in others specifically designating commutative division rings (what we now call fields in English).  A more complete comparison is found in the article [[Field (mathematics)]].\n\nSkew fields have an interesting [[lexical semantics|semantic]] feature: a modifier (here \"skew\") ''widens'' the scope of the base term (here \"field\"). Thus a field is a particular type of skew field, and not all skew fields are fields.\n\nWhile division rings and algebras as discussed here are assumed to have associative multiplication, [[Division algebra#Not necessarily associative division algebras|nonassociative division algebras]] such as the [[octonion]]s are also of interest.\n\nA [[near-field (mathematics)|near-field]] is an algebraic structure similar to a division ring, except that it has only one of the two [[distributive law]]s.\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hua's identity]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Lam |first1=Tsit-Yuen |authorlink1=Tsit Yuen Lam |title=A first course in noncommutative rings |url= |edition=2nd |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] |volume=131 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn=0-387-95183-0 | zbl=0980.16001 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Cohn | first=P.M. | authorlink=Paul Cohn | title=Skew fields.

It was part of the [[New Millennium Program]], dedicated to testing advanced technologies.\n\nLaunched on 24 October 1998, the ''Deep Space 1'' spacecraft carried out a flyby of asteroid [[9969 Braille]], which was its primary science target. The mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet [[19P/Borrelly]] and further engineering testing. Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration. While the flyby of the asteroid was only a partial success, the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information. Three of twelve technologies on board had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue.\n\nThe Deep Space series was continued by the ''[[Deep Space 2]]'' probes, which were launched in January 1999 piggybacked on the [[Mars Polar Lander]] and were intended to strike the surface of Mars (though contact was lost and the mission failed). ''Deep Space 1'' was the first NASA spacecraft to use [[ion thruster|ion propulsion]] rather than the traditional chemical-powered rockets.\n\n==Technologies==\nThe purpose of ''Deep Space 1'' was technology development and validation for future missions; 12 technologies were tested:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/ds1/tech/index.php |title=Advanced Technologies |publisher=NASA{{\\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>\n#Solar Electric Propulsion\n#Solar Concentrator Arrays\n#Multi-functional Structure\n#Miniature Integrated Camera and Imaging Spectrometer\n#Ion and Electron Spectrometer\n#Small Deep Space Transponder\n#Ka-Band Solid State Power Amplifier\n#Beacon Monitor Operations\n#Autonomous Remote Agent\n#Low Power Electronics\n#Power Actuation and Switching Module\n#Autonomous Navigation\n\n===Autonav===\nThe Autonav system, developed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], takes images of known bright [[asteroid]]s. The asteroids in the inner Solar System move in relation to other bodies at a noticeable, predictable speed. Thus a spacecraft can determine its relative position by tracking such asteroids across the star background, which appears fixed over such timescales. Two or more asteroids let the spacecraft triangulate its position; two or more positions in time let the spacecraft determine its trajectory. Existing spacecraft are tracked by their interactions with the transmitters of the [[NASA Deep Space Network]] (DSN), in effect an inverse [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. However, DSN tracking requires many skilled operators, and the DSN is overburdened by its use as a communications network. The use of Autonav reduces mission cost and DSN demands.\n\nThe Autonav system can also be used in reverse, tracking the position of bodies relative to the spacecraft. This is used to acquire targets for the scientific instruments. The spacecraft is programmed with the target's coarse location. After initial acquisition, Autonav keeps the subject in frame, even commandeering the spacecraft's attitude control.<ref name=ANS-PFR>{{cite conference |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.7850&rep=rep1&type=pdf |title=The Deep Space 1 Autonomous Navigation System: A Post-Flight Analysis |conference=AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference. 14-17 August 2000.

The activity was sponsored by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. The concentrating lens technology was combined with dual-junction solar cells, which had considerably better performance than the [[GaAs]] solar cells that were the state of the art at the time of the mission launch.\n\nThe SCARLET arrays generated 2.5 kilowatts at 1 AU, with less size and weight than conventional arrays.\n\n===NSTAR ion engine===\n{{main article|NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness}}\nAlthough [[ion engine]]s had been developed at NASA since the late 1950s, with the exception of the [[SERT-1|SERT]] missions in the 1960s, the technology had not been demonstrated in flight on United States spacecraft, though hundreds of [[Hall-effect thruster|Hall-effect engines]] had been used on Soviet and Russian spacecraft.  This lack of a performance history in space meant that despite the potential savings in propellant mass, the technology was considered too experimental to be used for high-cost missions. Furthermore, unforeseen side effects of ion propulsion might in some way interfere with typical scientific experiments, such as fields and particle measurements.  Therefore, it was a primary mission of the ''Deep Space 1'' demonstration to show long-duration use of an ion thruster on a scientific mission.<ref name=\"MD\">{{cite journal |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19098/1/98-0310.pdf |title=Mision Design for Deep Space 1: A Low-thrust Technology Validation Mission |journal=Acta Astronautica |first1=Marc D. |last1=Rayman |first2=Pamela A. |last2=Chadbourne |first3=Jeffery S. |last3=Culwell |first4=Steven N. |last4=Williams |volume=45 |issue=4-9 |pages=381\u2013388 |date=August\u2013November 1999 |doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(99)00157-5 |bibcode=1999AcAau..45..381R |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172350/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/19098/1/98-0310.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness]] (NSTAR) [[electrostatic ion thruster]], developed at NASA Glenn, achieves a [[specific impulse]] of 1000\u20133000 seconds. This is an order of magnitude higher than traditional space propulsion methods, resulting in a mass savings of approximately half. This leads to much cheaper launch vehicles. Although the engine produces just {{convert|92|mN|lk=on}} thrust at maximal power (2,100 W on DS1), the craft achieved high speeds because ion engines thrust continuously for long periods.<ref name=\"MD\"/>\n\nThe next spacecraft to use NSTAR engines was ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'', with three redundant units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft.asp |title=Dawn: Spacecraft |publisher=NASA{{\\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image|align=center|image1=Ion Engine Being Installed in High Vacuum Tank - GPN-2000-000597.jpg|width1=269|image2=Deep Space 1 spacecraft.jpg|width2=170|image3=Deep Space 1 lifted.jpg|width3=149|caption1=Technicians are installing ion engine #1 in the High Vacuum Tank in the Electric Propulsion Research Building in this image from 1959.|caption2=The fully assembled<br>''Deep Space 1''|caption3=The ''Deep Space 1'' experimental solar-powered [[Ion thruster|ion propulsion engine]]}}\n\n===Remote Agent===\nRemote Agent (RAX), remote intelligent self-repair software developed at NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was the first artificial-intelligence control system to control a spacecraft without human supervision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/planning-and-scheduling/remote-agent/ |title=Remote Agent |publisher=NASA |accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> Remote Agent successfully demonstrated the ability to plan onboard activities and correctly diagnose and respond to simulated faults in spacecraft components through its built-in REPL environment.<ref name=\"RAX.debug\">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZK0tW8EhQ#t=2371s |title=The Remote Agent Experiment: Debugging Code from 60 Million Miles Away |work=YouTube.com |publisher=Google Tech Talks |first=Ron |last=Garret |date=14 February 2012}} [http://www.flownet.com/ron/RAX2.pdf Slides].</ref> Autonomous control will enable future spacecraft to operate at greater distances from Earth and to carry out more sophisticated science-gathering activities in deep space. Components of the Remote Agent software have been used to support other NASA missions. Major components of Remote Agent were a robust planner (EUROPA), a plan-execution system (EXEC) and a model-based diagnostic system (Livingstone).<ref name=\"RAX.debug\" /> EUROPA was used as a ground-based planner for the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s. EUROPA II was used to support the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' Mars lander]] and the [[Mars Science Laboratory]]. Livingstone2 was flown as an experiment aboard [[Earth Observing-1]] and on an [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] at NASA's [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].\n\n===Beacon Monitor===\nAnother method for reducing DSN burdens is the [[Beacon mode service|Beacon Monitor]] experiment. During the long cruise periods of the mission, spacecraft operations are essentially suspended. Instead of data, the craft emits a [[carrier signal]] on a predetermined frequency. Without data decoding, the carrier can be detected by much simpler ground antennas and receivers. If the spacecraft detects an anomaly, it changes the carrier between four tones, based on urgency. Ground receivers then signal operators to divert DSN resources. This prevents skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally. A similar system is used on the ''[[New Horizons]]'' Pluto probe to keep costs down during its ten-year cruise from Jupiter to Pluto.\n\n===SDST===\n[[File:MSL-SDST.jpg|thumb|A Small Deep Space Transponder]]\nThe [[Small Deep Space Transponder]] (SDST) is a compact and lightweight radio-communications system. Aside from using miniaturized components, the SDST is capable of communicating over the [[Ka band|K<sub>a</sub> band]]. Because this band is higher in frequency than bands currently in use by deep-space missions, the same amount of data can be sent by smaller equipment in space and on the ground. Conversely, existing DSN antennas can split time among more missions. At the time of launch, the DSN had a small number of K<sub>a</sub> receivers installed on an experimental basis; K<sub>a</sub> operations and missions are increasing.\n\nThe SDST was later used on other space missions such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (the Mars rover ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'').<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso14_MSL_Telecom.pdf |title=Mars Science Laboratory Telecommunications System Design |series=Design and Performance Summary Series |publisher=NASA{{\\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first1=Andre |last1=Makovsky |first2=Peter |last2=Ilott |first3=Jim |last3=Taylor |date=November 2009}}</ref>\n\n===PEPE===\nOnce at a target, DS1 senses the particle environment with the PEPE (Plasma Experiment for Planetary Exploration) instrument. This instrument measured the flux of ions and electrons as a function of their energy and direction. The composition of the ions was determined by using a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]].\n\n===MICAS===\nThe MICAS (Miniature Integrated Camera And [[Spectrometer]]) instrument combined visible light imaging with infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy to determine chemical composition. All channels share a {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} telescope, which uses a [[silicon carbide]] mirror.\n\nBoth PEPE and MICAS were similar in capabilities to larger instruments or suites of instruments on other spacecraft. They were designed to be smaller and require lower power than those used on previous missions.\n\n==Mission overview==\n[[File:Animation of Deep Space 1 trajectory.gif|thumb|250px|Animation of ''Deep Space 1''{{'s}} trajectory from 24 October 1998 to 31 December 2003 <br/> {{legend2|magenta|''Deep Space 1''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|lime|[[9969 Braille]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|royalblue|[[Earth]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|[[19P/Borrelly]]}}]]\n[[File:9969 Braille - PIA01345.png|thumb|9969 Braille as imaged by DS1]]\n[[File:Comet Borrelly Nucleus.jpg|thumb|Comet 19P/Borrelly imaged just 160 seconds before DS1's closest approach]]\n\nPrior to launch, ''Deep Space 1'' was intended to visit comet [[76P/West\u2013Kohoutek\u2013Ikemura]] and asteroid [[3352 McAuliffe]].<ref name=\"comets\">{{cite web |url=http://spider.seds.org/spider/Comets/c_missions.html |title=Comet Space Missions |website=SEDS.org |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> Because of the delayed launch, the targets were changed to asteroid [[9969 Braille]] (at the time called 1992 KD) and comet [[4015 Wilson\u2013Harrington|107P/Wilson\u2013Harrington]].<ref name=\"comets\" /> It achieved an impaired flyby of Braille and, due to problems with the star tracker, was re-tasked to fly by comet [[19P/Borrelly]], which was successful.<ref name=\"results2001\" /> An August 2002 flyby of asteroid {{mpl|1999 KK|1}} as another extended mission was considered, but ultimately was not advanced due to cost concerns.<ref name=\"wired20011218\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/12/49210 |title=End of the Line for NASA Probe |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Noah |last=Schactman |date=18 December 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617005731/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/12/49210 |archivedate=17 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"rayman20011218\">{{cite web|url=http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/arch/mrlog74.html |title=Mission Update |work=Dr. Marc Rayman's Mission Log |publisher=NASA{{\\}}Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Marc |last=Rayman |date=18 December 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813095208/http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/arch/mrlog74.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> During the mission, high quality infrared spectra of [[Mars]] were also taken.<ref name=\"results2001\" /><ref name=\"naif.ds1.mission\" />\n\n===Results and achievements===\nThe ion propulsion engine initially failed after 4.5 minutes of operation. However, it was later restored to action and performed excellently. Early in the mission, material ejected during launch vehicle separation caused the closely spaced ion extraction grids to short-circuit. The contamination was eventually cleared, as the material was eroded by electrical arcing, sublimed by outgassing, or simply allowed to drift out. This was achieved by repeatedly restarting the engine in an engine repair mode, arcing across trapped material.<ref name=\"results2000\">{{cite journal |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17743/1/99-1185.pdf |title=Results from the Deep Space 1 Technology Validation Mission |journal=Acta Astronautica |first1=Marc D. |last1=Rayman |first2=Philip |last2=Varghese |first3=David H. |last3=Lehman |first4=Leslie L. |last4=Livesay |volume=47 |issue=2-9 |pages=475\u2013487 |date=July\u2013November 2000 |doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(00)00087-4 |bibcode=2000AcAau..47..475R |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415134047/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/17743/1/99-1185.pdf |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was thought that the ion engine exhaust might interfere with other spacecraft systems, such as radio communications or the science instruments. The PEPE detectors had a secondary function to monitor such effects from the engine. No interference was found.\n\nAnother failure was the loss of the [[star tracker]]. The star tracker determines spacecraft orientation by comparing the star field to its internal charts. The mission was saved when the MICAS camera was reprogrammed to substitute for the star tracker. Although MICAS is more sensitive, its field-of-view is an order of magnitude smaller, creating a greater information processing burden. Ironically, the star tracker was an off-the-shelf component, expected to be highly reliable.<ref name=\"results2001\">{{cite journal|url=http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/DS1_Extended_Mission.pdf |title=The Deep Space 1 Extended Mission |journal=Acta Astronautica |first1=Marc D. |last1=Rayman |first2=Philip |last2=Varghese |volume=48 |issue=5-12 |pages=693\u2013705 |date=March\u2013June 2001 |doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(01)00044-3 |bibcode=2001AcAau..48..693R |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509104812/http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/DS1_Extended_Mission.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nWithout a working star tracker, ion thrusting was temporarily suspended. The loss of thrust time forced the cancellation of a flyby past comet [[107P/Wilson\u2013Harrington]].\n\nThe Autonav system required occasional manual corrections. Most problems were in identifying objects that were too dim, or were difficult to identify because of brighter objects causing diffraction spikes and reflections in the camera, causing Autonav to misidentify targets.\n\nThe Remote Agent system was presented with three simulated failures on the spacecraft and correctly handled each event.\n# a failed electronics unit, which Remote Agent fixed by reactivating the unit.\n# a failed sensor providing false information, which Remote Agent recognized as unreliable and therefore correctly ignored.\n# an attitude control thruster (a small engine for controlling the spacecraft's orientation) stuck in the \"off\" position, which Remote Agent detected and compensated for by switching to a mode that did not rely on that thruster.\nOverall this constituted a successful demonstration of fully autonomous planning, diagnosis, and recovery.\n\nThe MICAS instrument was a design success, but the ultraviolet channel failed due to an electrical fault.  Later in the mission, after the star tracker failure, MICAS assumed this duty as well.  This caused continual interruptions in its scientific use during the remaining mission, including the Comet Borrelly encounter.<ref name=\"results2003\"/>\n\nThe flyby of the asteroid [[9969 Braille]] was only a partial success. ''Deep Space 1'' was intended to perform the flyby at {{convert|56000|km/h|abbr=on}} at only {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}} from the asteroid. Due to technical difficulties, including a software crash shortly before approach, the craft instead passed Braille at a distance of {{convert|26|km|0|abbr=on}}. This, plus Braille's lower [[albedo]], meant that the asteroid was not bright enough for the Autonav to focus the camera in the right direction, and the picture shoot was delayed by almost an hour.<ref name=\"results2001\"/>  The resulting pictures were disappointingly indistinct.\n\nHowever, the flyby of Comet Borrelly was a great success and returned extremely detailed images of the comet's surface. Such images were of higher resolution than the only previous pictures, of [[Halley's Comet]] taken by the ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'' spacecraft. The PEPE instrument reported that the comet's fields were offset from the nucleus. This is believed to be due to emission of jets, which were not distributed evenly across the comet's surface.\n\nDespite having no debris shields, the spacecraft survived the comet passage intact. Once again, the sparse comet jets did not appear to point towards the spacecraft. ''Deep Space 1'' then entered its second extended mission phase, focused on retesting the spacecraft's hardware technologies. The focus of this mission phase was on the ion engine systems.

30 August 1748 \u2013 29 December 1825) was a French painter in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s his cerebral brand of [[history painting]] marked a change in taste away from [[Rococo]] frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling,<ref>[[Matthew Collings]]. {{cite episode\n | title = Feelings\n | episodelink = \n | series = This Is Civilisation\n | serieslink = \n | airdate = 2007\n | season = 1\n | number = 2}}</ref> harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].\n\nDavid later became an active supporter of the [[French Revolution]] and friend of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] (1758\u20131794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the [[French First Republic|French Republic]]. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], The First Consul of France. At this time he developed his [[Empire style]], notable for its use of warm [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] colours. After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to [[Brussels]], then in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], where he remained until his death. David had [[:Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David|a large number of pupils]], making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic [[Paris Salon|Salon]] painting.\n\n==Early life==\nJacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his well-off architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the [[Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations]], [[University of Paris]], but he was never a good student: he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, \"I was always hiding behind the instructor's chair, drawing for the duration of the class\". Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1703\u20131770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a [[Rococo]] painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over David's tutelage, he would send David to his friend, [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] (1716\u20131809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There David attended the [[Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy]], based in what is now the [[Louvre]].\n[[File:Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore, by Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''Mademoiselle Guimard as Terpsichore'', 1774\u20135, an early work]]\nEach year the Academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]], which funded a three- to five-year stay in the Eternal City. The culmination of the Academy's educational program, the Rome trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Each ''pensionnaire'' was lodged in the French Academy's Roman outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David competed for, and failed to win, the prize for three consecutive years (with ''[[Minerva Fighting Mars]]'', ''[[Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe's Children]]'' and ''[[The Death of Seneca (David)|The Death of Seneca]]''), each failure contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution.  After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zeal\u2014only to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of ''[[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease]]'', a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy at Rome]].<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\nWhile in Italy, David especially studied the works of 17th-century masters such as [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[the Carracci]].<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> Although he declared, \"the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move\",<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter [[Raphael Mengs]] (1728\u20131779), who opposed the tendency in [[Rococo painting]] to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs' principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David's pre-revolutionary painting, such as ''[[The Vestal Virgin (David)|The Vestal Virgin]]'', probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717\u20131768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history.<ref>Alex Potts, ''Flesh and the Ideal: Winckelmann and the Origins of Art History'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000).</ref> In 1779, David toured the newly excavated ruins of [[Pompeii]], which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power. While in Rome, David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, [[Raphael]] making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist.\n\n==Early work==\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Equestrian portrait of Stanis\u0142aw Kostka Potocki - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of count Stanislas Potocki|Equestrian portrait of Stanis\u0142aw Kostka Potocki]]'' (1781)]]\n\nDavid's fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, but they recognized his genius. David's stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year, but in July 1780 he returned to Paris.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made a member of the Royal Academy. He sent the Academy two paintings, and both were included in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the King's buildings, M. P\u00e9coul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, [[Marguerite Charlotte P\u00e9coul|Marguerite Charlotte]]. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had his own pupils, about 40 to 50, and was commissioned by the government to paint \"Horace defended by his Father\", but he soon decided, \"Only in Rome can I paint Romans.\" His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife and three of his students, one of whom, [[Jean-Germain Drouais]] (1763\u20131788), was the Prix de Rome winner of that year.\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (second version; 1786)]]\nIn Rome, David painted his famous ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784. In this piece, the artist references [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values while alluding to [[Rousseau]]'s social contract. The republican ideal of the general will becomes the focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father. The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=394}}.</ref> The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers. David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath making ritual; they also appear to be smaller in scale than the male figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=399}}.</ref>  The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the men's rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=398}}.</ref>  Here we see the clear division of male-female attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseau's popularized doctrine of \"separate spheres\".\n\nThese revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the ''[[Distribution of Eagles]]''. While ''Oath of the Horatii'' and ''[[The Tennis Court Oath (David)|The Tennis Court Oath]]'' stress the importance of masculine self-sacrifice for one's country and patriotism, the ''Distribution of Eagles'' would ask for self-sacrifice for one's Emperor ([[Napoleon]]) and the importance of battlefield glory.\n[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787)]]\n\nIn 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly. The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the Academy in years to come.\n\nFor the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous ''[[The Death of Socrates|Death of Socrates]]''.  \"Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the [[Conium|hemlock]] brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed.\" Critics compared the Socrates with [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel|Sistine Ceiling]] and Raphael's Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as \"in every sense perfect\". [[Denis Diderot]] said it looked like he copied it from some ancient [[bas-relief]]. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal \"works of encouragement\".\n\n[[File:David Brutus.jpg|thumb|''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'' (1789)]]\n\nFor his next painting, David created ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]''. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the [[French Revolution]] had begun. The [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] had been established, and the [[Bastille]] had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David's [[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife|portrait of Lavoisier]], who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons.<ref>{{Harvnb|Honour|1977|p=72}}.</ref> When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'', the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France.\n\n==The French Revolution==\nIn the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of [[Robespierre]] and a member of the [[Jacobin Club]]. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the Execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. It is uncertain why he did this,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David's love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government.\n \nOthers believed that they found the key to the artist's revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, David's artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his \"powerful ambition...and unusual energy of will\" actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that \"generous ardor\", high-minded idealism and well-meaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period.\n\nSoon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition against his work, as seen in previous episodes in David's life. The Royal Academy was chock full of royalists, and David's attempt to reform it did not go over well with the members. However, the deck was stacked against this symbol of the old regime, and the National Assembly ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution.\n\nDavid then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic. David's painting of Brutus was shown during the play ''Brutus'', by the famous Frenchman, [[Voltaire]]. The people responded in an uproar of approval.\n\nIn 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of ''[[Tennis Court Oath|The Oath of the Tennis Court]]''. David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The King's acquiescence with the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], they made a 'solemn oath never to separate' until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime|ancien regime]]''. Rejecting the current conditions, the oath signified a new transition in human history and ideology.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Warren|title=Jaques-Louis David and Jean-Louis Prieur revolutionary artists : the public, the populace, and images of the French revolution|date=2000|publisher=State university of New York press|location=New York|isbn=0791442888|pages=229}}</ref> David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event.<ref name=\"Crow 2007\">{{Harvnb|Crow|2007}}.</ref>\n\nThis instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project.<ref name=\"Oxford\">Lee, Simon. \"David, Jacques-Louis.\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. 14 Nov 2014.<http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T021541>.</ref>\n\nDavid set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large pen-and-ink drawing. As in the ''Oath of the Horatii'', David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David's deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be \"blowing\" through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution.\n\nSymbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time. The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a \"constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bordes|2005|p=??}}.</ref> The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowd's arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape. Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the [[Tennis Court Oath]].\n[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing by Jacques-Louis David of the Tennis Court Oath. David later became a deputy in the [[National Convention]] in 1792 ]]\nIn his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in \"real time\", David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world. However, [[Thomas E. Crow|Thomas Crow]] argues that this path \"proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting.\"<ref name=\"Crow 2007\"/>   Essentially, the history of the demise of David's ''The Tennis Court Oath'' illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences.  Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in ''The Tennis Court Oath'' no longer existed in radicalized 1792.  The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power.  By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were \"heroes\".  A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate David's work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned ''The Oath of the Tennis Court''. To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message.\n\nWhen Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaire's old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791 David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panth\u00e9on. Despite rain, and opposition from conservatives based on the amount of money that was being spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the \"Father of the Revolution\" be carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.\n\n[[File:Le repr\u00e9sentant du peuple Fran\u00e7ois en fonction2.jpg|right|thumb|Republican costume designed by David. Engraving by [[Dominique Vivant|Denon]].]]David incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals; in effect radicalizing the applied arts, themselves. The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David's Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] ([[Marianne]]). Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=97}}.</ref> In his speech during the procession, David \"explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=99}}.</ref> The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. \"David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunt|2004|p=103}}.</ref> Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around.\n\nIn June 1791, the King made an [[flight to Varennes|ill-fated attempt to flee the country]], but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Netherlands border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II of Austria]], Marie-Antoinette's brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792\u2014it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends [[Jean-Paul Marat]] and Robespierre. In the Convention, David soon earned a nickname \"ferocious terrorist\". Soon, Robespierre's agents discovered a secret vault of the king's proving he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI and David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, a royalist, to divorce him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nWhen Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as well\u2014[[Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau]]. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted ''Le Peletier Assassinated''.  In it, the assassin's sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier's body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king. The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written \"I vote the death of the tyrant\", and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription \"David to Le Peletier. 20 January 1793\". The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletier's royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts. Nevertheless, this work was important in David's career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', David's masterpiece.\n\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marat assassinated - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|'' [[The Death of Marat]]'' (1793)]]\n\nOn 13 July 1793, David's friend Marat was assassinated by [[Charlotte Corday]] with a knife she had hidden in her clothing. She gained entrance to Marat's house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France. Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him. She was guillotined shortly thereafter. Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in David's subsequent painting, ''[[The Death of Marat]]''. Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panth\u00e9on. Marat's body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marat's body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schama|1989|p=83}}.</ref>\n\n''The Death of Marat'', perhaps David's most famous painting, has been called the [[Piet\u00e0]] of the revolution. Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said \"Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend; their desolate voice was heard: David, take up your brushes.., avenge Marat... I heard the voice of the people. I obeyed.\"  David had to work quickly, but the result was a simple and powerful image.\n\n''The Death of Marat'', 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution. This piece stands today as \"a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artist's political convictions are directly manifested in his work\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=454}}.</ref>  A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenblum|1969|p=83}}.</ref> The subject although realistically depicted remains lifeless in a rather supernatural composition. With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene; alluding to an out of this world existence.  \"Atheists though they were, David and Marat, like so many other fervent social reformers of the modern world, seem to have created a new kind of religion.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Janson|Rosenblum|1984|p=30}}.</ref> At the very center of these beliefs, there stood the republic.\n\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie Antoinette]] on the Way to the [[Guillotine]], 16 October 1793. Sketched from a window in the rue Sainte-Honor\u00e9 while the cart went past.]]\n\nAfter the King's execution, war broke out between the new Republic and virtually every major power in Europe. David, as a member of the [[Committee of General Security]], contributed directly to the Reign of Terror.<ref>{{Harvnb|Boime|1987|p=442}}.</ref> David organized his last festival: the festival of the Supreme Being. Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic and based on the ideas of Rousseau. This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state. The festivals, called f\u00eates, would be the method of indoctrination. On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath.\n\nSoon, the war began to go well; French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium), and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more. Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror. As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend \"if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you.\"<ref>Carlyle, p. 384.</ref> After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of \"stomach pain\", which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre. David was arrested and placed in prison, first from 2 August to 28 December 1794 and then from 29 May to 3 August 1795.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/> There he painted his own portrait, showing him much younger than he actually was, as well as that of his jailer.\n\n==Post-revolution==\n[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'' (1799)]]\nAfter David's wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story of [[The rape of the Sabine women]].  ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running between the Combatants'', also called ''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' is said to have been painted to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90\u2013112}}.</ref>\n\nDavid conceived a new style for this painting, one which he called the \"Grecian style\", as opposed to the \"Roman style\" of his earlier historical paintings. The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. In David's words, \"the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90\u2013115}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|''The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries'' (1812) [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.  ]]\nThis work also brought him to the attention of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The story for the painting is as follows: \"The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines. To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediately\u2014since Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to [[Romulus]], the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim. Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children. The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations.\" During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed. When David was finally released to the country, France had changed. His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her.  He remarried her in 1796. Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part, retired from politics.\n\nIn August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by [[Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy]] which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome. The Director Barras believed that David was \"tricked\" into signing, although one of David's students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy.\n\n==Napoleon==\n[[File:Jacques Louis David - Bonaparte franchissant le Grand Saint-Bernard, 20 mai 1800 - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass]]'' (1801)]] \nDavid's close association with the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror resulted in his signing of the death warrant for [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]], a minor noble. Beauharnais's widow, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]], went on to marry [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and became his empress; David himself depicted their coronation in the ''Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, 2&nbsp;December 1804''.\n\n[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Le peintre d'histoire encourag\u00e9 par le gouvt.jpg|thumb|''Historical painter encouraged by the government'', 1814 caricature, [[bodleian library]].]]\nDavid had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonaparte's classical features. Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797. David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished. Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to [[Egypt]] in 1798, but David refused, claiming he was too old for adventuring and sending instead his student, [[Antoine-Jean Gros]].{{Citation needed|reason=Please prove where it says Gros even went to Egypt|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter Napoleon's [[18 Brumaire|successful coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1799, as First Consul he commissioned David to commemorate his daring crossing of the Alps. The crossing of the St. Bernard Pass had allowed the French to surprise the Austrian army and win victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] on 14 June 1800. Although Napoleon had crossed the Alps on a mule, he requested that he be portrayed \"calm upon a fiery steed\". David complied with ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps|Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard]].''  After the proclamation of the Empire in 1804, David became the official [[court painter]] of the regime. During this period he took students, one of whom was the Belgian painter [[Pieter van Hanselaere]].\n\n[[File:Jacques Louis David - Le couronnement de l'Empereur et de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice, 2 d\u00e9cembre 1804 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'', (1806)]]\n\nOne of the works David was commissioned for was ''The Coronation of Napoleon in Notre Dame''. David was permitted to watch the event. He had plans of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] delivered and participants in the coronation came to his studio to pose individually, though never the Emperor (the only time David obtained a sitting from Napoleon had been in 1797). David did manage to get a private sitting with the Empress Jos\u00e9phine and Napoleon's sister, [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline Murat]], through the intervention of erstwhile art patron Marshal [[Joachim Murat]], the Emperor's brother-in-law. For his background, David had the choir of Notre Dame act as his fill-in characters. [[Pope Pius VII]] came to sit for the painting, and actually blessed David. Napoleon came to see the painter, stared at the canvas for an hour and said \"David, I salute you.\" David had to redo several parts of the painting because of Napoleon's various whims, and for this painting, he received twenty-four thousand Francs.\n\n==Exile and death==\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Sisters Z\u00e9na\u00efde and Charlotte Bonaparte - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''The Sisters Z\u00e9na\u00efde and Charlotte Bonaparte'' (1821)]]\n \nOn the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] returning to power, David figured in the list of proscribed former revolutionaries and Bonapartists\u2014for having voted execution for the deposed King Louis XVI; and for participating in the death of [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]]. Mistreated and starved, the imprisoned Louis XVII was forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie-Antoinette. This was untrue, as the son was separated from his mother early and was not allowed communication with her, nevertheless, the allegation helped earn her the guillotine. The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter. David refused, preferring self-exile in Brussels. There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists like [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Navez]] and [[Ignace Brice]], painted ''Cupid and Psyche'' and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife (whom he had remarried). In that time, he painted smaller-scale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic \u00e9migr\u00e9s, such as the Baron Gerard.\n\nDavid created his last great work, ''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus|Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces]]'', from 1822 to 1824. In December 1823, he wrote: \"This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush.\" The finished painting\u2014evoking painted porcelain because of its limpid coloration\u2014was exhibited first in Brussels, then in Paris, where his former students flocked to view it. \n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Mars desarme par Venus.JPG|thumb|''[[Mars Being Disarmed by Venus|Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces]]'', David's last great work (1824)]] \nThe exhibition was profitable\u201413,000 francs, after deducting operating costs, thus, more than 10,000 people visited and viewed the painting. In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech. In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his \"Anger of Achilles\" (also known as the \"Sacrifice of Iphigenie\"); the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the [[Kimbell Art Museum|Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas]]. David remarked to his friends who visited his studio \"this [painting] is what is killing me\" such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the painting's merits. By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise Firmin-Didot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition \"Pour les grecs\" that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826.\n\nWhen David was leaving a theater, a carriage struck him, and he later died, on 29 December 1825. At his death, some portraits were auctioned in Paris, they sold for little; the famous ''Death of Marat'' was exhibited in a secluded room, to avoid outraging public sensibilities. Disallowed return to France for burial, for having been a regicide of King Louis XVI, the body of the painter Jacques-Louis David was buried in Brussels and moved in 1882 to [[Grave of Jacques-Louis David|Brussels Cemetery]], while some say his heart was buried with his wife at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris.\nDavid was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1803. He was promoted to an Officier in 1808. And, in 1815, he was promoted to a Commandant (now Commandeur) de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\n==Freemasonry==\nThe theme of the oath found in several works like ''The Oath of the Tennis Court'', ''The Distribution of the Eagles'', and ''Leonidas at Thermopylae'', was perhaps inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry. In 1989 during the \"David against David\" conference Albert Boime was able to prove, on the basis of a document dated in 1787, the painter's membership in the \"La Moderation\" Masonic Lodge.<ref>Les th\u00e8mes du serment, David et la Franc-ma\u00e7onnerie ;page 83 (Boime, 1989)</ref><ref>Le Paris des Francs- Ma\u00e7ons (Emmanuel Pierret, Laurent Kupferman - 2013 - ed. Cherche midi)</ref>\n\n==Medical analysis of David's face==\n[[File:David Self-Portrait 1791.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''Self-Portrait'' (1791)]]\nJacques-Louis David's facial abnormalities were traditionally reported to be a consequence of a deep facial sword wound after a [[fencing]] incident. These left him with a noticeable asymmetry during facial expression and resulted in his difficulty in eating or speaking (he could not pronounce some consonants such as the letter 'r'). A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his self-portrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve. An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a [[benign tumor]]. These however may have been a [[granuloma]], or even a post-traumatic [[neuroma]].<ref>Ashrafian, H. ''Jacques-Louis David and his post-traumatic facial pathology''. ''J R Soc Med'' 2007;100:341-342.</ref> As Simon Schama has pointed out, witty banter and public speaking ability were key aspects of the social culture of 18th-century France. In light of these cultural keystones, David's tumor would have been a heavy obstacle in his social life.<ref>Schama, Simon. ''The Power of Art: Jacques-Louis David''. https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart/david.shtml</ref> David was sometimes referred to as \"David of the Tumor\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=1\u201330}}.</ref>\n\n==Portraiture==\nIn addition to his history paintings, David completed a number of privately commissioned portraits. Warren Roberts, among others, has pointed out the contrast between David's \"public style\" of painting, as shown in his history paintings, and his \"private style\", as shown in his portraits.<ref name=\"RobertsWarren\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42\u201345}}.</ref> His portraits were characterized by a sense of truth and realism. He focused on defining his subjects\u2019 features and characters without idealizing them.<ref> Bordes, Phillip. \u201cJacques-Louis David: Empire to Exile.\u201d New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007. </ref> This is different from the style seen in his historical paintings, in which he idealizes his figures\u2019 features and bodies to align with Greek and Roman ideals of beauty.<ref>Wilson, Elizabeth Barkley. \"Jacques-Louis David.\" Smithsonian 29, no. 5 (August 1998): 80. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed November 18, 2017).</ref> He puts a great deal of detail into his portraits, defining smaller features like hands and fabric. The compositions of his portraits remain simple with blank backgrounds that allow the viewer to focus on the details of the subject.\n\nThe portrait he did of his wife (1813) is an example of his typical portrait style.<ref name=\"RobertsWarren\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42\u201345}}.</ref> The background is dark and simple without any clues as to the setting, which forces the viewer to focus entirely on her. Her features are un-idealized and truthful to her appearance.<ref name=\"RobertsWarren\">{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=42\u201345}}.</ref> There is a great amount of detail that can be seen in his attention to portraying the satin material of the dress she wears, the drapery of the scarf around her, and her hands which rest in her lap. \n\nIn the painting of Brutus (1789), the man and his wife are separated, both morally and physically. Paintings like these, depicting the great strength of patriotic sacrifice, made David a popular hero of the revolution.<ref name=\"RobertsWarren\" />\n\nIn the ''[[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife]]'' (1788), the man and his wife are tied together in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interest\u2014Lavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people. David, then a powerful member of the National Assembly, stood idly by and watched.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=43\u201345}}.</ref>\n\nOther portraits include paintings of his sister-in-law and her husband, Madame and Monsieur Seriziat. The picture of Monsieur Seriziat depicts a man of wealth, sitting comfortably with his horse-riding equipment. The picture of the Madame shows her wearing an unadorned white dress, holding her young child's hand as they lean against a bed. David painted these portraits of Madame and Monsieur Seriziat out of gratitude for letting him stay with them after he was in jail.<ref>Lajer-Burcharth, Ewa. \u201cNecklines: The Art of Jacques-Louis David After the Terror.\u201d New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of David's life, he painted a portrait of his old friend ''[[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]]''. Both had been involved in the Revolution, both had survived the purging of political radicals that followed the reign of terror. \n[[File:Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s - crop.jpg|thumb|alt=|''[[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]]'', 1817]]\n\n==Shift in attitude==\nThe shift in David's perspective played an important role in the paintings of David's later life, including this one of Siey\u00e8s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=90\u2013150}}.</ref> During the height of the reign of terror, David was an ardent supporter of radicals such as Robespierre and Marat, and twice offered up his life in their defense. He organized revolutionary festivals and painted portraits of martyrs of the revolution, such as Lepeletier, who was assassinated for voting for the death of the king. David was an impassioned speaker at times in the National Assembly. In speaking to the Assembly about the young boy named Bara, another martyr of the revolution, David said, \"O Bara! O Viala! The blood that you have spread still smokes; it rises toward Heaven and cries for vengeance.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=88\u201392}}.</ref>\n\nAfter Robespierre was sent to the guillotine, however, David was imprisoned and changed the attitude of his rhetoric. During his imprisonment he wrote many letters, pleading his innocence. In one he wrote, \"I am prevented from returning to my atelier, which, alas, I should never have left. I believed that in accepting the most honorable position, but very difficult to fill, that of legislator, that a righteous heart would suffice, but I lacked the second quality, understanding.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|p=90\u201394}}.</ref>\n\nLater, while explaining his developing \"Grecian style\" for paintings such as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'', David further commented on a shift in attitude: \"In all human activity the violent and transitory develops first; repose and profundity appear last. The recognition of these latter qualities requires time; only great masters have them, while their pupils have access only to violent passions.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=100\u2013112}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nJacques-Louis David was, in his time, regarded as the leading painter in France, and arguably all of Western Europe; many of the painters honored by the restored Bourbons following the French Revolution had been David's pupils.<ref name=\"Lee 321\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=321}}</ref>  David's student [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] for example, was made a Baron and honored by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s court.<ref name=\"Lee 321\"/>  Another pupil of David's, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism.<ref name=\"Lee 321\"/> David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as [[Joseph-Beno\u00eet Suv\u00e9e]], who had also started teaching classes.<ref>P. Bordes, Jacques-Louis David:Empire to Exile. Yale University Press, 2005</ref> To be one of David's students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime reputation.<ref name=\"Lee 321\u2013322\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=321\u2013322}}</ref> He also called on the more advanced students, such as [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Martin Langlois]], to help him paint his large canvases.\n\nDespite David's reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. David's art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=322}}</ref> David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy's approach to art.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|p=14}}.</ref> David's later works also reflect his growth in the development of the [[Empire style]], notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David's opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror.<ref name=\"Lee 321\u2013322\"/> David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for [[King Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]]. One significant episode in David's political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter [[Carle Vernet]] had approached David, who was on the [[Committee of Public Safety]], requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Simon|title=David|pages=151}}</ref> David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed.

In the 1840s, percussionists began to experiment with foot pedals as a way to enable them to play more than one instrument, but these devices would not be mass-produced for another 75 years. By the 1860s, percussionists started combining multiple drums into a set. The [[bass drum]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbals]], and other [[percussion instruments]] were all struck with hand-held [[drum stick]]s. Drummers in [[musical theatre|musical theater]] shows and stage shows, where the budget for [[pit orchestra]]s was often limited, contributed to the creation of the drum set by developing techniques and devices that would enable them to cover the roles of multiple percussionists.\n\n[[Double-drumming]] was developed to enable one person to play the bass and snare with sticks, while the cymbals could be played by tapping the foot on a \"low-boy\". With this approach, the bass drum was usually played on beats one and three (in 4/4 time). While the music was first designed to accompany marching soldiers, this simple and straightforward drumming approach eventually led to the birth of [[ragtime]] music when the simplistic marching beats became more syncopated. This resulted in a greater [[Swing music|'swing']] and dance feel. The drum set was initially referred to as a \"trap set\", and from the late 1800s to the 1930s, drummers were referred to as \"trap drummers\".  By the 1870s, drummers were using an \"overhang pedal\". Most drummers in the 1870s preferred to do double drumming without any pedal to play multiple drums, rather than use an overhang pedal. Companies patented their pedal systems such as Dee Dee Chandler of New Orleans 1904\u201305.<ref>Porter/Hull man/Hazel (1993).  ''Jazz \u2013 From its Origins to the Present'', p.18. {{ISBN|0-13-512195-7}}.</ref> Liberating the hands for the first time, this evolution saw the bass drum played with the foot of a standing percussionist (thus the term \"kick drum\"). The bass drum became the central piece around which every other percussion instrument would later revolve.\n\nWilliam F. Ludwig, Sr., and his brother, Theobald Ludwig, founded the Ludwig & Ludwig Co. in 1909 and patented the first commercially successful [[bass drum pedal]] system, paving the way for the modern drum kit.<ref name=\"DRUMHISTORY\"/> It was the golden age of drum building for many famous drum companies, with Ludwig introducing... \"The ornately engraved\" Black Beauty Brass Snare drum; Slingerland premiered its Radio King solid-maple shell; Leedy invented the floating drum head & self-aligning lug;& Gretsch originated the three-way tension system of the Gladstone snare drum\".<ref>(Latter quote from pages 5\u20136 of Jon Cohan's \"Star Sets- Drum Kits of the Great Drummers\", with a foreword by Bill Bruford).</ref> Wire brushes for use with drums and cymbals were introduced in 1912. The need for brushes arose due to the problem of the drum sound overshadowing the other instruments on stage. Drummers began using metal fly swatters to reduce the volume on stage next to the other acoustic instruments. Drummers could still play the rudimentary snare figures and grooves with brushes that they would normally play with drumsticks.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Dance band drummer at Mark Foy's Empress Ballroom from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|Dance band drummer Stan Farmer in 1935 at Mark Foy's Empress Ballroom in Sydney, New South Wales, using a kit with bass drum pedal and a \"low sock\"]]\n[[File:Juke joint drummer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|\nDrummer in a Memphis \"juke joint\" orchestra playing a kit with four non-tunable [[tom-toms|toms]].

Drum kits became a central part of [[jazz]] music, especially [[Dixieland]]. The modern drum kit was developed in the [[Vaudeville]] era during the 1920s in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buford|first=Jon Cohan ; foreword by Bill|title=Star sets : drum kits of the great drummers|year=1995|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, WI|ISBN=0-7935-3489-5}}</ref> In 1917, a New Orleans band called \"The Original Dixieland Jazz Band \" recorded jazz tunes that became hits all over the country. These were the first official jazz recordings. Drummers such as Baby Dodds, [[Zutty Singleton|\"Zutty\" Singleton]] and [[Ray Bauduc]] had taken the idea of marching rhythms, combining the bass drum and snare drum and  \"traps\", a term used to refer to the percussion instruments associated with immigrant groups, which included miniature cymbals, tom toms, cowbells and woodblocks. They started incorporating these elements with [[ragtime]], which had been popular for a couple of decades, creating an approach which evolved into a jazz drumming style.\n\nBudget constraints and space considerations in [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s led bandleaders to pressure fewer percussionists to cover more percussion parts. Metal consoles were developed to hold Chinese [[tom-toms]], with swing-out stands for [[snare drum]]s and [[cymbal]]s. On top of the console was a \"contraption\" tray (shortened to \"trap\"), used to hold items like [[whistle]]s, [[klaxon]]s, and [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], so these drums/kits were dubbed \"trap kits\". [[Hi-hat (instrument)|Hi-hat]] stands became available around 1926.<ref name=\"DRUMHISTORY\">{{cite book |title=The Drum Book: The History of the Rock Drum Kit |first=Geoff |last=Nichols |year=1997 |location=London |publisher=Balafon Books |pages=8\u201312 |isbn=0879304766 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1918 [[Baby Dodds]] (Warren \"Baby\" Dodds, circa 1898\u20131959), playing on riverboats with [[Louis Armstrong]] on the Mississippi, was modifying the military marching set-up and experimenting with playing the drum rims instead of woodblocks, hitting cymbals with sticks (1919), which was not yet common, and adding a side cymbal above the bass drum, what became known as the ride cymbal. Drum maker William Ludwig developed the \"sock\" or early low-mounted high-hat after observing Dodd's drumming. Ludwig noticed that Dodd tapped his left foot all the time.  Dodds had Ludwig raise the newly produced low hats 9 inches higher to make it easier to play, thus creating the modern hi-hat cymbal.<ref>Information on Dodds is found in his own contemporary journals/biography  \"The Baby Dodds Story\" -Louisiana State University Press, 1992, and by contemporary witness- drummer Gearge Wettling, who confirms Dodds was the first drummer to also keep the now-famous broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse/roll of what we call ride cymbal playing.</ref> Dodds was one of the first drummers to also play the broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse and roll of modern ride cymbal playing.

When drinking became illegal, it became popular in underground nightclubs. The type of music that was played at these underground establishments that were selling alcohol was jazz. It was not seen as upstanding to listen to or perform jazz music, because it was an [[African American]] style and at that time the United States was segregated and racism was an overtly prevalent issue. Because jazz music was seen as great dance music, [[big band]] jazz became popular in nightclubs. In the 1920s, freelance drummers emerged. They were hired to play shows, concerts, theaters, clubs and back dancers and artists of various genres. Just as modern drummers have many different roles, so did the drummers of the 1920s. One important role for drummers in the 1920s is what is referred to in modern times as a [[foley artist]]. During [[silent film]]s, an orchestra was hired to accompany the silent film and the drummer was responsible for providing all the sound effects. Drummers played instruments to imitate gun shots, planes flying overhead, a train coming into a train station, and galloping horses etc.\n\nSheet music from the 1920s provides evidence that the drummer's sets were starting to evolve in size and sound to support the various acts mentioned above. However, the first \"talkies\" or films with audio, were released circa 1927 and by 1930 most films were released with a soundtrack and the silent film era was over. The downside of the technological breakthrough was that thousands of drummers who served as sound effect specialists were put out of work overnight. A similar panic was felt by drummers in the 1980s, when electronic [[drum machine]]s were first released.\n\n===Big Band drumming===\n[[File:Gene Krupa crop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Gene Krupa]] was the first jazz drummer to lead his own big band (1946)]]\n[[File:Louis Bellson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louis Bellson]] with the Duke Ellington Orchestra at the Palomar Supper Club. Vancouver, B.C., 19 April 1952]]\n\nIn 1929, when the stock market crash resulted in a global depression, one of the things that helped people cope with the trying years was swing jazz music. By the early to mid 1930's, [[big band]] [[Swing music|swing]] was being embraced throughout the US, becoming the country's most popular form of music. The other contributing factor to the big band's success during the 1930s was the popularity of radio. The drum kit played a key role in the big band swing sound. Throughout the 1930s [[Chick Webb]] and [[Gene Krupa]] at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, increased the  visual and musical driving force of the drummer and their equipment by simply being so popular and in demand- and  they ensured that their  drum kits became not only functionally developed but dazzling and well designed.<ref>J. Cohan page 13</ref> Jazz drummers were influential in developing  the concept of the modern drum kit and extending playing techniques. [[Gene Krupa]] was the first drummer to head his own orchestra and thrust the drums into the  spotlight with his drum solos.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Others would soon follow his lead.\n\nAs the music of the world was evolving, so was the drum set. Tom-tom drums, small crash cymbals, Chinese cymbals and hi-hat cymbals were added to the drum set. The hi-hats were the primary way for the drummers of the big band era to keep time. Before 1930, while playing the New Orleans jazz and Chicago styles, drummers would choke the cymbals on the \"ands\" of eighth note figures as an alternative to playing a buzz roll, the rim of the drums, or on the woodblocks to keep time. This muting method of keeping time by choking the crash and china cymbals proved to be awkward, so the drummers of that time came up with the idea of having a foot-operated cymbal. This resulted in the creation of the snowshoe cymbal, a foot-operated cymbal. It enabled drummers to play the eighth note figures between the right and left foot, improving the ergonomics and facility of drumset playing and helping drummers to keep a more steady rhythm.\n\nToward the end of the 1920s, variations of the hi-hats were introduced. One of the most popular hand held hi-hat cymbal variations used was called the \"hand sock cymbals\". The reason for the name \"hi-hat\" was because earlier versions of the hi-hat were referred to as a \"low boy\". The evolution that became the \"hi-hats\" allowed drummers to play the two cymbals with drum sticks while simultaneously controlling how open or closed the two cymbals were with their foot. The pedal could also be used to play the cymbals with the foot alone, while the right hand played other drums. By the 1930s, [[Ben Duncan]] and others popularized streamlined trap kits leading to a basic [[#Four piece with floor tom|four piece]] drum set standard: [[Bass drum|bass]], snare, tom-tom, and a larger [[floor tom]]. In time, legs were fitted to larger floor toms, and \"consolettes\" were devised to hold smaller tom-toms (ride toms) on the bass drum.\n\n===Bebop drumming===\nIn the early 1940s, many jazz musicians, especially African American jazz musicians, started to stray from the popular big band dance music of the 1930s. Their experimentation and quest for deeper expression and freedom on the instrument led to the birth of a new style of music based from Harlem called [[bebop]] music. Whereas swing was a popular music designed for dancing, bebop was a \"musician's music\" designed for listening. During the bebop era, given that bands no longer had to accompany dancers, [[bandleader]]s could speed up the tempo. Bebop was also much more based on improvisation, in comparison to the heavily [[Arranging|arranged]] big band scores.  Bebop musicians would take an old standard and re-write the melody, add more complex chord changes, resulting in a new composition.\n\nSwing drummers such as [[Max Roach]] and [[Kenny Clarke]] had already deviated from the large marching band-style bass drums, finding that they were too loud and boomy. Bebop drummers continued this trend, and they started trying out smaller bass drum sizes in the drum set. Bebop drummers' experimentations with new drum sizes and new sounds led to the innovative concept of applying the busy \"four on the floor\" bass drum rhythms to a new larger cymbal called the ride cymbal. By focusing on keeping time on the new ride cymbal instead of the bass drum, the \"feel\" went from bass drum and hi-hat heavy, to a lighter melodic feel that has been explained as \"floating on top of the time\". This allowed drummers to express themselves in a more melodic fashion by playing the rhythms used by the guitar, piano and sax players using the new smaller, more focused bass drums and snare. [[Louie Bellson]] also assisted in the innovative sizes and sounds of the 1940s drum set by pioneering the use of two bass drums, or the double bass drum kit.\n\n===Rock drumming===\n[[File:John Bonham 1975.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], New York City, 1973]]\nWith [[rock and roll]] coming into place, a watershed moment occurred between 1962 and 1964 when the [[Surfaris]] released \"Wipe Out\", as well as when [[Ringo Starr]] of [[The Beatles]] played his [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] kit on American television. As rock moved from the [[nightclub]]s and bars and into stadiums in the 1960s, there was a trend towards bigger drum kits. The trend towards larger drum kits took momentum in the 1970s with the emergence of [[progressive rock]]. By the 1980s, widely popular drummers like [[Billy Cobham]], [[Carl Palmer]], [[Nicko McBrain]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stewart Copeland]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] and [[Neil Peart]] were using large numbers of drums and cymbals. In the 1980s, some drummers began to use [[electronic drums]].\n\nIn the 2010s, some drummers use a variety of auxiliary percussion instruments, found objects, and electronics as part of their \"drum\" kits. Popular electronics include: electronic sound modules; laptop computers used to activate [[Loop (music)|loops]], [[Music sequencer|sequences]] and [[Sampling (music)|samples]]; [[metronome]]s and tempo meters; recording devices; and personal sound reinforcement equipment (e.g., a small [[PA system]] to amplify electronic drums and provide a monitor).\n\n===Recording===\nOn early recording media (until 1925<ref name=\"Hazel 1993 p.44\">Porter/Hullman/Hazel (1993).  ''Jazz \u2013 From its Origins to the Present'', p.44. {{ISBN|0-13-512195-7}}.</ref>) such as [[wax cylinder]]s and [[Gramophone record|disc]]s carved with an engraving needle, sound balancing meant that musicians had to be literally moved in the room.<ref name=\"Hazel 1993 p.44\"/> Drums were often put far from the horn (part of the mechanical transducer) to reduce sound [[distortion]]. Since this affected the rendition of cymbals at playback, [[sound engineer]]s of the time remedied the situation by asking drummers to play the content of the cymbals onto [[woodblocks]], [[temple blocks]], and cowbells for their loudness and short decay.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Components==\n\n===Terminology===\n\n====Breakables, shells, extensions, hardware====\n[[File:WTB Hihats Snares.jpg|thumb|Foreground: Snare drums. Midground: Hi-hat cymbals. Background: Ride/Crash cymbals]]\nThe drum kit may be loosely divided into four parts:\n{{anchor|Breakables}}<!--''Breakables'' redirects to this anchor-->\n* '''Breakables''': Sticks, various cymbals, snare drum, throne (stool) and sometimes the bass drum pedal.\n* '''Shells''': Bass drum and toms.\n* '''Extensions''': Cowbell, tambourine, chimes, any other instrument not part of the standard kit.\n* '''Hardware''': Cymbal stands, drum stands, pedals.\n\nThere are several reasons for this division. When more than one band plays in a single performance, the drum kit is often considered part of the [[backline (stage)|backline]] (the key [[rhythm section]] equipment that stays on stage all night, which often also includes [[bass amp]]s and a [[stage piano]]), and is shared between/among the drummers. Oftentimes, the main \"headlining\" act will provide the drums, as they are being paid more, possibly have the better gear, and in any case have the prerogative of using their own. Sticks, snare drum and cymbals, and sometimes other components, are commonly swapped though, each drummer bringing their own. The term ''breakables'' in this context refers to whatever basic components the \"guest\" drummer is expected to bring. Similar considerations apply if using a \"house kit\" (a drum kit owned by the venue, which is rare), even if there is only one band at the performance.\n\nThe snare drum and cymbals are the core of the ''breakables'', as they are particularly critical and individual components of the standard kit, in several related ways.\n* Their tone varies a great deal from drummer to drummer, reflecting their individual styles and the styles of music they play. As such, even drummers from the same genre of music may prefer a different brand or size of snare.\n* The snare drum often does not match the kit, for example being a metal or plain wood shell in a kit where the other drums are in a matching finish.\n* Drummers tend to spend more time playing the snare and cymbals than the other drums.\n* Thin or bell-metal cymbals are easily broken by poor technique.\n* Many drummers use thinner heads on their snare than the other drums.\n* Often, a drummer will retain their snare drum and cymbals when upgrading the rest of the kit, or upgrade cymbals or snare while keeping the other drums.\n\nMuch the same considerations apply to bass drum pedals and the stool, but these are not always considered ''breakables'', particularly if changeover time between bands is very limited. Swapping the snare drum in a standard kit can be done very quickly. Replacing cymbals on stands takes longer, particularly if there are many of them, and cymbals are easily damaged by incorrect mounting, so many drummers prefer to bring their own cymbal stands.\n\n====Drum sizes====\nSee [[#Common configurations|Common configurations]] below for typical drum sizes.\n\nTraditionally, in America and the United Kingdom, drum sizes were expressed as ''depth x diameter'', both in [[inch]]es, but many drum kit manufacturers have since begun to express their sizes in terms of ''diameter x depth''; still in the measure of inches.\n\nManufacturers using the American traditional format in their catalogs include these:\n* [[ddrum]]\n* [[Drum Workshop]]\n* [[Gretsch Drums]]\n* [[Ludwig-Musser]]\n* [[Slingerland Drum Company]]\n* [[Tama Drums]]\n* [[Seb Custom Drums]]\nThose using the European measures of diameter x depth include these:\n* [[Brady Drum Company]]\n* [[Mapex Drums]]\n* [[Meinl Percussion]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Artist Series Attack Timbales (Dave Mackintosh) | url=http://meinlpercussion.com/no_cache/percussion/meinl-percussion/timbales/action/show/Product/1323/#item1323  | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122181209/http://meinlpercussion.com/no_cache/percussion/meinl-percussion/timbales/action/show/Product/1323/ | archivedate=22 January 2013| quote=a pair of 8\u201d diameter timbale shells with a depth of 9\u201d and 11\u201d respectively''...

When applied in this fashion, it supplies strong regular accents, played by the left hand (if right handed), and the backbone for many [[drum fill|fills]]. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the bed of stiff snare wires held under tension to the underside of the lower drum head. When the stiff wire are \"engaged\" (held under tension), they vibrate with the top (snare-side) drum skin (head), creating a snappy, staccato buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the batter head.\n\n====Toms====\n[[File:Keith Moon 4 - The Who - 1975.jpg|left|thumb|270px|[[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] with a mixture of [[concert tom]]s and conventional toms, 1975]] \n{{main|tom-tom drum}}\nTom-tom drums, or ''toms'' for short, are drums without snares and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires), and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.\n\nThey include:\n* Traditional [[Cannon depth|double-headed rack toms]], of varying depths\n* [[Floor tom]]s (generally the widest and largest toms, which also makes them the lowest-pitched toms)\n* Single-headed [[concert tom]]s\n* [[Rototoms]]\n\nThe smallest and largest drums without snares, [[octobans]] and [[gong drum]]s respectively, are sometimes considered toms. The naming of [[#Common configurations|common configurations]] (four-piece, five-piece, etc.) is largely a reflection of the number of toms, as only the drums are conventionally counted, and these configurations all contain one snare and one or more bass drums, (though not regularly any standardized use of 2 bass/kick drums) the balance usually being in toms.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Bass drum====\n[[File:Bass drum.jpg|thumb|250px|A drum kit bass drum]]\n[[File:ImprovisedDrumLondon.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[bass drum]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].]]\n{{main|bass drum}}\nThe bass drum (also known as the \"kick drum\") provides a regular but often-varied foundation to the rhythm. The bass drum is the lowest pitched drum and usually provides the basic beat or timing element with basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use [[double bass drumming|two or more bass drums]] or use a double bass drum pedal with a single bass drum. Double bass drumming is an important technique in many [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genres. Using a double bass drum pedal enables a drummer to play a double bass drum style with only one bass drum, saving space in recording/performance areas and reducing time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation.\n\n====Other drums====\n[[Octobans]] are smaller toms designed for use in a drum kit, extending the tom range upwards in pitch, primarily by their depth; as well as diameter (typically 6\"). Pearl brand octobans are called \"rocket toms\"; the instruments are also called [[File:Anders Johansson 2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]] with an array of Octobans]]\n\n[[Timbales]] are tuned much higher than a tom of the same diameter, and normally played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than a tom, but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms. [[Attack timbales]] and [[mini timbales]] are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae & numerous world music styles. Timbales were also used on occasion by [[Led Zeppelin]] drummer [[John Bonham]]. Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20\u201324 inches in diameter), but has the same purpose as that of a floor tom.\nSimilarly, most [[hand drum]] percussion cannot be played easily or suitably with drum sticks without risking damage to the head and to the bearing edge, which is not protected by a metal drum rim, like a snare or tom. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a metal drum head and played with care, or played by hand.\n\n===Cymbals===\n[[File:Portnoy 2327834448 d06703c5cd o.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mike Portnoy]], the ex drummer of [[Dream Theater]] with many cymbals. Rio de Janeiro, 7 March 2008]]\nIn most drum kits and drum/percussion kits cymbals are as important as the drums themselves. The oldest idiophones in music are cymbals, and were used throughout the ancient Near East, very early in the Bronze Age period. Cymbals are most associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship, where Zildjian (the name means cymbal smith) has predominantly made them since 1623.<ref>Remnant, M. (1989). Musical instruments. (pp. 159\u2013174). London: B.T. Batsford Ltd</ref>\n\nBeginners [[cymbal pack]]s normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. A few contain only three cymbals, using a [[crash/ride]] instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes closely follow those given in [[#Common configurations|Common configurations]] below.\n\nMost drummers soon extend this by adding another crash, a splash, a china/effects cymbal; or even all of those last mentioned.\n\n====Ride cymbal====\n{{main| Ride cymbal}}\nThe ride cymbal is most often used for keeping a constant-rhythm pattern, every beat or more often, as the music requires. Development of this ride technique is generally credited to [[Baby Dodds]].<ref name=\"pas\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | title=Warren 'Baby' Dodds | publisher=The Percussive Arts Society | accessdate=21 November 2011 | quote=Dodds' way of playing press rolls ultimately evolved into the standard jazz ride-cymbal pattern. Whereas many drummers would play very short press rolls on the backbeats, Dodds would start his rolls on the backbeats but extend each one to the following beat, providing a smoother time flow. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104938/http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | archivedate=27 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMost drummers have a single main ride, located near their right hand\u2014within easy playing reach, as it is used very regularly\u2014most often a 20\"  sizing but, 16\"-24\"  diameters are not uncommon. It is most often a heavy, or medium-weighted cymbal that cuts through other instrumental sounds, but some drummers use a [[swish cymbal]], [[sizzle cymbal]] or other exotic or lighter metal ride, as the main or only ride in their kit, particularly for jazz, gospel or ballad/folk sounds. In the 1960s [[Ringo Starr]] used a sizzle cymbal as a second ride, particularly during guitar solos.\n\n====Hi-hats====\n{{main|Hi-hat (instrument)}}\nThe hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed \"hats\") consist of two cymbals mounted facing each other on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support cylinder standing up. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals with one or two sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the footpedal, without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking \"open hi-hats\" (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed \"sloppy hats\") or a crisp \"closed hi-hats\" sound (with the pedal pressed down). As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.\n\nA unique effect can be created by striking an open hi-hat (i.e., in which the two cymbals are apart) and then closing the cymbals with the foot pedal; this effect is widely used in [[disco]] and [[funk]]. The hi-hat has a similar function to the ride cymbal. The two are rarely played consistently for long periods at the same time, but one or the other is used to keep the faster-moving rhythms (e.g., sixteenth notes) much of the time in a song. The hi-hats are played by the right stick of a right-handed drummer. Changing between ride and hi-hat, or between either and a \"leaner\" sound with neither, is often used to mark a change from one passage to another, for example; to distinguish between a verse and chorus.\n\n====Crashes====\n{{main|Crash cymbal}}\nThe crash cymbals are usually the strongest accent markers within the kit, marking crescendos and climaxes, vocal entries, and major changes of mood/swells and effects. A crash cymbal is often accompanied by a strong kick on the bass drum pedal, both for musical effect and to support the stroke. It provides a fuller sound and is a commonly taught technique.\n\nIn the very smallest kits, in jazz, and at very high volumes, ride cymbals may be played in with the technique and sound of a crash cymbal. Some hi-hats will also give a useful crash, particularly thinner hats or those with an unusually severe [[taper (cymbal)|taper]]. At low volumes, producing a good crash from a cymbal not particularly suited to it is a highly skilled art. Alternatively, specialised [[crash/ride]] and ride/crash cymbals are specifically designed to combine both functions.\n\n====Other cymbals====\n\n=====Effects cymbals=====\n{{Main|effects cymbal}}\n[[File:Sabian O-zone cymbal.jpg|thumb|[[Sabian]] O-zone \"vented\" crash cymbal]]\n\nAll cymbals other than rides, hi-hats and crashes/splashes are usually called [[effects cymbal]]s when used in a drum kit, though this is a non-classical or colloquial designation that has become a standardized label. Most extended kits include one or more [[splash cymbal]]s and at least one [[china cymbal]]. Major cymbal makers produce [[cymbal extension pack]]s consisting of one splash and one china, or more rarely a second crash, a splash and a china, to match some of their starter packs of ride, crash and hi-hats. However any combination of options can be found in the marketplace.\n\nSome cymbals may be considered effects in some kits but \"basic\" in another set of components. A [[swish cymbal]] may, for example serve, as the main ride in some styles of music, but in a larger kit, which includes a conventional ride cymbal as well, it may well be considered an effects cymbal per se. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.\n\n=====Accent cymbals=====\nCymbals of any type used to provide an [[accent (music)|accent]] rather than a regular pattern or [[groove (drumming)|groove]] are known as accent cymbals. While any cymbal can be used to provide an accent, the term is applied more correctly to cymbals for which the main purpose is to provide an accent. Accent cymbals include chime cymbals, small-bell domed cymbals or those with a clear sonorous/oriental chime to them like specialized crash and splash cymbals and many china types too, particularly the smaller or thinner ones.\n\n===Other acoustic instruments===\n[[File:G\u00fcnter Baby Sommer E5100543.jpg|thumb|250px|[[G\u00fcnter Sommer]] with [[bodhr\u00e1n]] and [[bongo drums]] in his kit]] \nOther instruments that have regularly been incorporated into drum kits include:\n* [[Wood block]] and [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]. These are traditional in classic rock. As well, they are used in culturally diverse forms of music\n* [[Tambourine]], particularly mounted on the hi-hat stand above the cymbals; an ordinary tambourine can be used, or a tambourine produced specially for drum kit use\n* [[Timbales]] can be used to extend the range of tom-toms, particularly when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional timbale is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal (see also [[Timbales#Non-traditional use]])\n* [[Xylophone]] or [[glockenspiel]]\n* [[Tubular bell]]s\n* [[Gong]]s\n* [[Bar chimes]]/orchestral chimes\n* [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]s.\n* [[Found object (music)|Found objects]], including [[wrench|spanners]], [[brake drum]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[cardboard box]]es, and jam and kerosene [[tin can|tin]]s (anything ordinary that can be percussively struck to produce sounds, patterns and grooves for their setting)\n\nSee also [[#Extended kits|Extended kits]] below.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Electronic drums===\n[[File:Clavia ddrum4 SE.jpg|thumb|Triggers sensors in use, here they are red and mounted on the rims of the snare drum, bass drum and hanging toms. The larger box in the same colour red is the \"brain\" to which they are connected.]]\n[[File:Korg Wavedrum WD-X.jpg|thumb|A [[Korg]] trigger pad]]\n[[File:Tampere Jazz Happening 2005 - KTU 2.jpg|thumb|[[Pat Mastelotto]] playing a kit with both acoustic and electronic drums, 2005]]\n{{main|Electronic drums}}\n[[File:V-drums-2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A MIDI drum kit|Drum controllers, such as the [[Roland V-Drums]], are often built in the form of an acoustic drum kit. The unit's sound module is mounted to the left.]]\nElectronic drums are used for many reasons. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or church services, where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since fully electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound (apart from the quiet sound of the stick hitting the sensor pads), all of the drum sounds come from a [[keyboard amplifier]] or [[PA system]]; as such, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some drummers use electronic drums as practice instruments, because they can be listened to with headphones, enabling a drummer to practice in an apartment or in the middle of the night without disturbing others. Some drummers use electronic drums to take advantage of the huge range of sounds that modern drum modules can produce, which range from sampled sounds of real drums, cymbals and percussion instruments (including instruments that would be impractical to take to a small gig, such as [[gong]]s or [[tubular bells]]), to electronic and synthesized sounds, including non-instrument sounds such as ocean waves.\n\nA fully electronic kit is also easier to [[soundcheck]] than acoustic drums, assuming that the electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has pre-set in her/his practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be miked and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the [[sound engineer]]. As well, even after all the individual drum and cymbal mics are soundchecked, the engineer needs to listen to the drummer play a standard groove, to check that the balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear her/his instruments and the instruments and vocals of the rest of the band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps could be eliminated.\n\nDrummers' usage of electronic drum equipment can range from adding a single electronic pad to an acoustic kit (e.g., to have access to an instrument that might otherwise be impractical, such as a large [[gong]]), to using a mix of acoustic drums/cymbals and electronic pads, to using an acoustic kit in which the drums and cymbals have triggers, which can be used to sound electronic drums and other sounds, to having an exclusively electronic kit, which is often set up with the rubber or mesh drum pads and rubber \"cymbals\" in the usual drum kit locations. A fully electronic kit weighs much less and takes up less space to transport than an acoustic kit and it can be set up more quickly. One of the disadvantages of a fully electronic kit is that it may not have the same \"feel\" as an acoustic kit, and the drum sounds, even if they are high-quality samples, may not sound the same as acoustic drums.\n\nElectronic drum pads are the second most widely used type of [[MIDI]] performance controllers, after electronic [[keyboard (music)|music keyboards]].<ref name=\"Manning\">Manning, Peter. ''Electronic and Computer Music''. 1985. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. Print.</ref>{{rp|319\u2013320|date=November 2012}} Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, they may be standalone control surfaces (e.g., rubber drum pads), or they may emulate the look and feel of acoustic percussion instruments. The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, and they are usually played with fingers.<ref name=\"Huber\">Huber, David Miles. \"The MIDI Manual\". Carmel, Indiana: SAMS, 1991.</ref>{{rp|88|date=November 2012}} Dedicated drum pads such as the [[Roland Octapad]] or the [[DrumKAT]] are playable with the hands or with sticks, and are often built to resemble the general form of a drum kit. There are also percussion controllers such as the [[vibraphone]]-style [[MalletKAT]],<ref name=\"Huber\" />{{rp|88\u201391|date=November 2012}} and [[Don Buchla]]'s [[Marimba Lumina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buchla.com/mlumina/description.html |title=\"Marimba Lumina Described\".

[[MIDI]] triggers can also be installed into acoustic drum and percussion instruments. Pads that can trigger a MIDI device can be homemade from a [[piezoelectric sensor]] and a practice pad or other piece of foam rubber.<ref>White, Paul. \"[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/aug95/diydrumpads.html DIY Drum Pads And Pedal Triggers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221126/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/aug95/diydrumpads.html |date=3 March 2016 }}\". ''Sound On Sound'' SOS Publications. Aug 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nThis is possible in two ways:\n* [[Trigger (drums)|Trigger]]s are sensors that can be attached to acoustic drum kit components. In this way, an electronic drum sound will be produced when the instrument is played/struck, as well as the original sound voiced by the instrument being available, if so desired .\n* [[Trigger pad]]s can be mounted alongside other kit components. These pads make no significant acoustic sound themselves (if not modified to do otherwise), but  are used purely to trigger the electronic sounds from the \"drum brain\". They are played with the same drum sticks as are used on other drum kit components.\n\nIn either case, an electronic [[sound module|control unit]] (sound module/\"brain\") with suitable sampled/modeled or synthesized drum sounds, amplification equipment (a [[PA system]], [[keyboard amp]], etc.) and [[Foldback (sound engineering)|stage monitor]] speakers are required for the drummer (and other band members and audience) to hear the electronically produced sounds. See [[Electronic drum#Acoustic triggered drum kit|Triggered drum kit]].\n\nA trigger pad could contain up to four independent sensors, each of them capable of sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular drum pad may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body and one for the bell at the centre of the cymbal, and perhaps a [[cymbal choke]] trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.\n\nTrigger sensors are most commonly used to replace the acoustic drum sounds, but they can often also be used  effectively with an acoustic kit to augment or supplement an instrument's sound for the needs of the session or show. For example, in a live performance in a difficult acoustical space, a trigger may be placed on each drum or cymbal, and used to trigger a similar sound on a [[drum module]]. These sounds are then amplified through the [[PA system]] so the audience can hear them, and they can be amplified to any level without the risks of [[audio feedback]] or bleed problems associated with microphones and PAs in certain settings.\n\nThe sound of electronic drums and cymbals themselves is heard by the drummer and possibly other musicians in close proximity, but even so, the [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (audio monitor) system is usually fed from the electronic sounds rather than the live acoustic sounds. The drums can be heavily dampened (made to resonate less or subdue the sound), and their tuning and even quality is less critical in the latter scenario. In this way, much of the atmosphere of the live performance is retained in a large venue, but without some of the problems associated with purely microphone-amplified drums. Triggers and sensors can also be used in conjunction with conventional or built-in microphones. If some components of a kit prove more difficult to \"mike\" than others (e.g., an excessively \"boomy\" low tom), triggers may be used on only the more difficult instruments, balancing out a drummer's/band's sound in the mix.\n\nTrigger pads and drums, on the other hand, when deployed in a conventional set-up, are most commonly used to produce sounds not possible with an acoustic kit, or at least not with what is available. Any sound that can be sampled/recorded can be played when the pad is struck, by assigning the recorded sounds to specific triggers . Recordings or samples of barking dogs, sirens, breaking glass and stereo recordings of aircraft taking off and landing have all been used. Along with the more obvious electronically generated sounds there are synthesized human voices or song parts or even movie audio or digital video/pictures that (depending on device used) can also be played/triggered by electronic drums.\n\n====Virtual drums====\nVirtual drums are a type of audio software that simulates the sound of a drum kit using synthesized drum kit sounds or [[Sampling (music)|digital samples]] of acoustic drum sounds. Different drum software products offer a recording function, the ability to select from several acoustically distinctive drum kits (e.g., jazz, rock, metal), as well as the option to incorporate different songs into the session. Some software for the personal computer (PC) can turn any hard surface into a virtual drum kit using only one microphone.\n\n===Hardware===\n{{main|drum hardware}}\n[[File:20 \ud654\ud569\uc758 \uc544\ub9ac\ub791\ud30c\ud2f0-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A drummer for a Korean Arirang ensemble.]]\n''Hardware'' is the name given to the metal stands that support the drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments. Generally the term also includes the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pedal and [[bass drum pedal]] or pedals, and the [[drum stool]], but not the [[drum stick]]s.\n\nHardware is carried along with sticks and other accessories in the [[traps case]], and includes:\n* [[Cymbal stand]]s\n* [[Hi-hat stand]]\n* [[Floor tom]] legs\n* [[Tom-tom drum]] brackets or arms\n* [[Snare drum stand]]\n* [[Bass drum pedal]] or pedals\n* [[Drum key]]\n* Assorted accessories such as spare washers, cymbal sleeves, wire snare cords, washers for tension rods, etc.\n\nMany or even all of the stands may be replaced by a [[drum rack]], particularly useful for large drum kits.\n\nDrummers often set up their own drum hardware onstage and adjust to their own comfort level. Major touring bands on tour will often have a [[Guitar technician|drum tech]] who knows how to set up the drummer's hardware and instruments in the desired location and layout.\n\n==Common configurations==\n[[File:Th05SuDaBruniesTrio.jpg|thumb|A two-piece kit in action]]\nDrum kits are traditionally categorised by the number of drums, ignoring cymbals and other instruments. Snare, tom-tom and bass drums are always counted; Other drums such as octobans may or may not be counted.<ref name=\"Peckman 31\">Peckman (2007), p.31.</ref>\n\nThe sizes of drums and cymbals given below are typical. Many drummers differ slightly or radically from them. Where no size is given, it is because there is too much variety to call a typical size.\n\n===Three-piece===\n[[File:Junior drum set.JPG|thumb|Three-piece set for a young player: 16\" bass, 10\" snare, one 10\" hanging tom]]\nA three-piece drum set is the most basic set. A conventional three-piece kit consists of a bass drum, a 14\" diameter snare drum, 12\"\u201314\" hi-hats, a single 12\" diameter hanging tom, 8\"\u20139\" in depth, and a suspended cymbal, in the range of 14\"\u201318\", both mounted on the bass drum. These kits were common in the 1950s and 1960s and are still used in the 2010s in small [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] dance bands. It is a common configuration for kits sold through [[mail order]], and, with smaller sized drums and cymbals, for kits for children.\n\n===Four-piece===\n[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fenklup.png|thumb|[[Mitch Mitchell]] playing a classic four-piece kit in the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]\nA four-piece kit extends the three-piece by adding one tom, either a second [[hanging tom]] mounted on the bass drum (a notable user is [[Chris Frantz]] of [[Talking Heads]]) and often displacing the cymbal, or by adding a [[floor tom]]. Normally another cymbal is added as well, so there are separate ride and crash cymbals, either on two stands, or the ride cymbal mounted on the bass drum to the player's right and the crash cymbal on a separate stand. The standard cymbal sizes are 16\" crash and 18\"\u201320\" ride, with the 20\" ride most common.\n\n====Four piece with floor tom====\nWhen a floor tom is added to make a four-piece kit, the floor tom is usually 14\" for jazz, and 16\" otherwise. This configuration is usually common in [[jazz]], classic [[Rock music|rock]] and [[rock and roll]]. Notable users include [[Ringo Starr]] in [[The Beatles]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] in the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and [[John Barbata]] in [[the Turtles]]. For jazz, which normally emphasizes the use of [[ride cymbal]], the lack of second hanging tom in a four-piece kit allows the cymbal to be positioned closer to the drummer, making them easier to be struck.\n\n====Four piece with two hanging toms====\nIf a second hanging tom is used, it is 10\" diameter and 8\" deep for fusion, or 13\" diameter and one inch deeper than the 12\" diameter tom. Otherwise, a 14\" diameter hanging tom is added to the 12\", both being 8\" deep. In any case, both toms are most often mounted on the bass drum with the smaller of the two next to the hi-hats (on the left for a right-handed drummer). These kits are particularly useful for smaller venues where space is limited, such as coffeehouses and small pubs.\n\n===Five-piece===\n[[File:Platin Drums PTCL2016 AF.jpg|thumb|250px|A basic five-piece fusion kit, with one crash cymbal and no effects cymbals, complete with throne (stool) and sticks]]\nThe five-piece kit is the full entry-level kit and the most common configuration. It adds a third tom to the bass drum/snare drum/two toms set, making three toms in all. A fusion kit will normally add a 14\" tom, either a floor tom or a hanging tom on a stand to the right of the bass drum; in either case, making the tom lineup 10\", 12\" and 14\". Having three toms enables drummers to have a low-pitched, middle-register and higher-pitched tom, which gives them more options for fills and solos.\n\nOther kits will normally have 12\" and 13\" hanging toms plus either a 14\" hanging tom on a stand, a 14\" floor tom, or a 16\" floor tom. For depths, see [[Tom-tom drum#Modern tom-toms]].  In the 2010s, it is very popular to have 10\" and 12\" hanging toms, with a 16\" floor tom.  This configuration is often called a hybrid setup.<ref name=SteveWeiss>Steve Weiss Music {{cite web |url=http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418150354/http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} 5/10/2012</ref> The bass drum is most commonly 22\" in diameter, but rock kits may use 24\", fusion 20\", jazz 18\",<ref name=\"Peckman 31\" /> and in larger bands up to 26\". A second crash cymbal is common, typically an inch or two larger or smaller than the 16\", with the larger of the two to the right for a right-handed drummer, but a big band may use crashes up to 20\" and ride up to 24\" or, very rarely, 26\". A rock kit may also substitute a larger ride cymbal or larger hi-hats, typically 22\" for the ride and 15\" for the hats.\n\nMost five-piece kits, at more than entry level, also have one or more [[effects cymbal]]s. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats and one crash configuration requires more stands in addition to the standard [[drum hardware pack]]s. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or even no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and also the [[bass drum pedal]] he/she prefers. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two [[cymbal stand]]s, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard [[cymbal pack]], a [[Drum stool|stool]] and a pair of [[5A (drum stick)|5A]] drum sticks. In the 2010s, [[electronic drum|digital]] kits are often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal triggers and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or rubber heads. The trigger-pads are wired up to a [[synth module]] or [[Sampler (music)|sampler]].\n\n===Small kits===\n[[File:Slim Jim Phantom Stray Cats, Sweden 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neo-Rockabilly]] pioneer [[Slim Jim Phantom]] playing a two-piece kit while standing]]\n\nIf the toms are omitted completely, or the bass drum is replaced by a pedal-operated beater on the bottom skin of a floor tom and the hanging toms omitted, the result is a two-piece \"[[Cocktail drum|cocktail]]\" (lounge) kit. Such kits are particularly favoured in musical genres such as [[trad jazz]], [[rockabilly]] and [[jump blues]]. Some rockabilly kits and beginners kits for very young players omit the hi-hat stand. In rockabilly, this allows the drummer to play standing rather than seated.\n\nAlthough these kits may be small with respect to the number of drums used, the drums themselves are most often normal sizes, or even larger in the case of the bass drum. Kits using smaller drums in both smaller and larger configurations are also produced for particular uses, such as ''boutique'' kits designed to reduce the visual impact that a large kit creates or due space constraints in coffeehouses, ''travelling'' kits to reduce luggage volume, and junior kits for very young players. Smaller drums also tend to be quieter, again suiting smaller venues, and many of these kits extend this with extra muffling which allows quiet or even silent practice in a hotel room or bedroom.  \n\n===Extended kits===\n[[File:OutsideBRX-15.JPG|right|thumb|200px | A seven-piece kit with snare, double bass drums, two hanging toms, two floor toms, hi-hats, ride cymbal, three crash cymbals, splash cymbal and china type]]\n\nCommon extensions beyond these standard configurations include:\n* [[Effects cymbal]]s, particularly [[splash cymbal]]s and [[china cymbal]]s\n* [[Double bass drum]]s. Double bass drums or a [[double bass pedal]] are standard for some genres, particularly in heavy metal music\n* Extra hanging or [[rack tom]]s\n* Extra Crash cymbals\n* A [[crash/ride cymbal]] in addition to the main ride\n* A second, larger or smaller floor tom\n* One or more [[octoban]]s or a pair of [[mini timbales]]\n* A second pair of hi-hats mounted as [[cable hats]] or [[x-hats]]\n* [[Cymbal stack]]s\n* Individual tiger, wind or chau [[gong]]s\n* Multiple ride cymbals. A [[sizzle cymbal]], thinner and larger than the main ride, was once common as a second ride or crash/ride, even in a four-piece kit, but is now less so (jazz drummers, however, may still have two or more ride cymbals, even in a small kit)\n\nSee also [[#Other acoustic instruments|other acoustic instruments]] above. Another versatile extension becoming increasingly common is the use of some [[#Electronic drums|electronic drums]] in a mainly conventional kit.\n\nLess common extensions found particularly, but not exclusive to very large kits, include:\n* Multiple snare drums, usually in the form of side snares. A side snare is usually positioned to the left of the drummer (opposite the floor toms and to the left of the hi hat). Side snares are used similarly to effects cymbals, when an additional and different sound is required. Generally only one side snare is used on a kit, if any at all. \n* Multiple bass drums beyond the double bass drum setup\n* [[Gong drum]]s (single headed bass drums, played with sticks or mallets)\n* Sets of [[gong]]s, tuned or untuned\n* Sound effects such as a [[thunder sheet]]\n* One or more [[crotales]]\n* Instruments \"borrowed\" from [[orchestral percussion]], such as [[timpani]]\n* Instruments \"borrowed\" from [[marching band]] percussion, such as the tuned bass drums used in the [[drumline]]\n[[File:Terry Bozzio drums.jpg|thumb|centre|400px|A very large kit played by [[Terry Bozzio]]]]\n\n==Accessories==\n\n===Sticks===\n{{main|Drum stick}}\nSticks were traditionally made from wood (particularly maple, hickory, and oak} but more recently metal, carbon fibre and other exotic materials have been used for high market end sticks. The prototypical wooden drum stick was primarily designed for use with the snare drum, and optimised for playing [[snare rudiment]]s. Sticks come in a variety of weights and tip designs; 7N is a common jazz stick with a nylon tip, while a 5B is a common wood tipped stick, heavier than a 7N but with a similar profile, and a common standard for beginners. Numbers range from 1 (heaviest) to 10 (lightest).\n\nThe meanings of both numbers and letters vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as ''Smooth Jazz'' (typically a 7N or 9N) or ''Speed Rock'' (typically a 2B or 3B) for example. Many famous drummers endorse sticks made to their particular preference and sold under their signature. \n[[File:Rogers Roy Burns sticks.jpg]]\nBesides drumsticks, drummers will also use brushes and rutes in jazz and similar softer music. More rarely, other beaters such as [[cartwheel mallet]]s (known to kit drummers as \"soft sticks\") may be used. It is not uncommon for rock drummers to use the \"wrong\" (butt) end of a stick for a heavier sound; some makers produce tipless sticks with two butt ends.\n\nA stick bag is the standard way for a drummer to bring drumsticks to a live performance. For easy access, the stick bag is commonly mounted on the side of the floor tom, just within reach of the drummer\u2019s right hand for a right-handed drummer.\n\n[[File:Drum sticks.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Tools of the trade: 7N, 5B, \"double bummer\", and side drum No. 3 sticks, standard 19 cane rutes, sheathed 7 cane rutes, nylon brushes, steel brushes, and cartwheels]]\n\n===Muffles===\n[[File:Ring muffle on snare.jpg|thumb|Mylar muffle ring on snare.]]\nDrum muffles are types of [[mute (music)|mute]]s that can reduce the ring, boomy [[overtone]] frequencies, or overall volume on a [[snare drum|snare]], [[bass drum|bass]], or [[tom-tom drum|tom]]. Controlling the ring is useful in studio or live settings when unwanted frequencies can clash with other instruments in the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]]. There are internal and external muffling devices which rest on the inside or outside of the [[drumhead]], respectively. Common types of mufflers include muffling rings,  [[Moongel|gels]] and duct tape, and improvised methods, such as placing a wallet near the edge of the head.<ref>[http://www.musiciansfriend.com/browse/article.jsp?mediaId=m710466] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617105218/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/browse/article.jsp?mediaId=m710466|date=17 June 2013}}</ref> Some drummers muffle the sound of a drum by putting a cloth over the drumhead.\n\n'''Snare drum and tom-tom'''\nTypical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing an object on the outer edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, [[Moongel|gel]], or fitted rings made of [[BoPET|mylar]] are common objects. Also used are external clip-on muffles that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.\n\n'''Bass drum'''\nMuffling the bass can be achieved with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.\n\n'''Silencers/mutes'''\nAnother type of drum muffler is a piece of rubber that fits over the entire drumhead or [[cymbal]]. It interrupts contact between the [[Drum stick|stick]] and the head which dampens the sound even more. They are typically used in practice settings.\n\n'''Cymbals''' are usually muted with the fingers or hand, to reduce the length or volume of ringing (e.g., the [[cymbal choke]] technique which is a key part of [[heavy metal drumming]]). Cymbals can also be muted with special rubber rings or with [[DIY]] approaches such as using duct tape.\n\n'''Companies with muffle products:'''\n*[[Remo]]\n*[[Pearl Drums]]\n*[[Tama Drums]]\n*[[Vic Firth]]\n*[http://www.aquariandrumheads.com/ Aquarian]\n*[[D'Addario|HQ Percussion]]\n*[[D'Addario|Evans]]\n*Cymbomute\n\n'''Historical uses'''\nMuffled drums are often associated with funeral ceremonies as well, such as the funerals of [[John F.

Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a \"sizzler\" chain is that the chain can be removed and the cymbal will return to its normal sound (in contrast, a cymbal with rivets would have to have the rivets removed).\nSome sizzlers feature pivoting arms that allow the chains to be quickly raised from the cymbal, or lowered onto it, allowing the effect to be used for some songs and removed for others.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Cases===\n[[File:Drum kit cases.JPG|thumb|A five-piece kit in hard cases. From left: [[traps case]], floor tom case, snare drum case (in front), twin hanging toms case, cymbal case. Rear: bass drum case.]]\nThree types of protective covers are common for kit drums:\n* Drum bags are made from robust cloth such as [[cordura]] or from cloth-backed [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. They give minimal protection from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are just starting out.\n* Mid-price hard cases are of similar construction to [[suitcase]]s, commonly made of fibre composite. The offer more protection from bumps than cloth bags.\n*[[Flight case]]s or [[road case]]s are standard for professional touring drummers.\n\nAs with all musical instruments, the best protection is a provided by a combination of a hard-shelled case with padding such as foam next to the drums or cymbals.\n\n===Microphones===\n[[File:Carl Palmer.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Palmer]] with rim-mounted tom mics]]\n[[Microphone]]s (\"mics\") are used with drums to pick up the sound of the drums and cymbals for a [[sound recording]] and/or to pick up the sound of the drum kit so that it can be amplified through a [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]]. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows in the 2010s, so that the [[sound engineer]] can adjust and balance the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play in quieter genres of music and that play in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups such as [[jazz quartet]]s or [[organ trio]]s that are playing in a small bar will often just use acoustic drums. Of course if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be mic'ed so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues; they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but rather mic only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.\n\nIn \"miking\" a drum kit, [[dynamic microphone]]s, which can handle high sound-pressure levels, are usually used to close-mic drums, which is the predominant way to mic drums for live shows.  [[Condenser microphone]]s are used for overheads and room mics, an approach which is more common with sound recording applications. Close miking of drums may be done using stands or by mounting the microphones on the rims of the drums, or even using microphones built into the drum itself, which eliminates the need for stands for these microphones, reducing both clutter and set-up time, as well as isolating them.\n\nIn some styles of music, drummers use electronic effects on drums, such as individual [[noise gate]]s that mute the attached microphone when the signal is below a threshold volume. This allows the sound engineer to use a higher overall volume for the drum kit by reducing the number of \"active\" mics which could produce unwanted [[Acoustic feedback|feedback]] at any one time. When a drum kit is entirely miked and amplified through the [[sound reinforcement system]], the drummer or the sound engineer can add other [[effect units|electronic effects]] to the drum sound, such as [[reverb]] or [[digital delay]].\n\nSome drummers arrive at the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands provided by the venue's sound engineer. Other drummers bring their all of their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., a good quality bass drum mic and a good mic for the snare) to ensure that they have good quality mics for each show. In bars and nightclubs, the microphones supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.\n\n{{Clear}}\n===Monitors===\nDrummers using [[electronic drums]], [[drum machine]]s, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic drums and cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]], [[keyboard amplifier]] or even a small [[PA system]] to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear her drums, especially if she is playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from huge, powerful guitar stacks. Since the drum kit uses the deep bass drum, drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15\" [[subwoofer]] to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear the rest of their kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a \"[[butt shaker]]\" or \"throne thumper\" to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a \"butt shaker\", the \"thump\" of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer ''feels'' their beat on the posterior, rather than hears it.\n\n===Bass drum gear===\nA number of accessories are designed for the bass drum (also called \"kick drum\"). Ported tubes for the bass drum are available to take advantage of the [[bass reflex]] speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a [[speaker enclosure]] to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KickPortB |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220171718/http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KickPortB |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bass drumhead patches are available, which protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.\n\n===Gloves===\nSome drummers wear special drummer's gloves to improve their grip on the sticks when they play. Drumming gloves often have a textured grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on the parts of the glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate perspiration.\n\n===Drum screen===\n[[File:Tris Imboden.jpg|thumb|American rock and jazz drummer [[Tris Imboden]] using a clear perspex drum screen on stage.]]{{main|drum screen}}\nIn some styles or settings, such as country music clubs or churches, small venues, or when a live recording is being made, the drummer may use a transparent perspex or [[plexiglas]] ''drum screen'' (also known as a ''drum shield'') to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit is known as a ''drum booth''. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the [[audio engineer]] can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the [[PA system]] mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Hi-hat stand spikes.PNG|thumb|Two hi-hat stands, both with retractable spikes extended]]\n\n===Carpets===\nDrummers often bring a carpet, mats or rugs to venues to prevent the bass drum and hi-hat stand from \"crawling\" (moving away) on a slippery surface from the drum head striking the bass drum. The carpet also reduces short reverberation (which is generally but not always an advantage), and helps to prevent damage to the flooring or floor coverings. In shows where multiple drummers will bring their kits onstage over the night, it is common for drummers to mark the location of their stands and pedals with tape, to allow for quicker positioning of a kits in a drummer's accustomed position. Bass drums and hi-hat stands commonly have retractable spikes to help them to grip surfaces such as carpet, or stay stationary (on hard surfaces) with rubber feet.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Practice Pad + Metronome Combo - Best Practice.jpg|thumb|Using a metronome with a practice pad is a common and effective way to practice. Movement Drum Co. 4-in-1 Pad and SYNKD.]]\n\n===Practice equipment===\n[[File:ARNO DRUM KEYS COLLECTION Custom Drum Key.jpg|thumb|100px|An Arno drum key]]\nDrummers use a variety of accessories when practicing. [[Metronome]]s and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady pulse. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A [[practice pad]], held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks. A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by [[electronic drums]], which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and kits with non-sounding mesh heads.\n\n===Tuning equipment===\n{{main|drum key}}\nDrummers use a [[drum key]] for tuning their drums and adjusting some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) there are various tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums \"[[Playing by ear|by ear]]\" or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which \"measures tympanic pressure\" on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DrumdialDigital |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911120620/http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DrumdialDigital |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic [[common time]] groove with bass (bottom), [[back beat (music)|back beat]] snare, and cymbal (top) is common in [[popular music]]{{Audio|Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid|play}}]]\n\n[[File:4beat example 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[swing (music)|swing]] groove, common in jazz and early rock music,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} with a [[duple time]] [[shuffle rhythm]].

Fills could include a [[Sting (percussion)|sting]] at the end of a musical section or act as a drum showpiece.\n\n===Fills===\n{{main|drum fill}}\nA ''[[Fill (music)|fill]]'' is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill is used to \"fill in\" the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus. Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare, to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic [[drum solo]]s. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in preparing and indicating significant  changes of sections in songs and linking sections. A ''vocal cue'' is a short drum fill that introduces a vocal entry. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a [[chorus (song)|chorus]] or [[verse (popular music)|verse]].\n\n===Drum solos===\n{{main|drum solo}}\nA drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the virtuosity, skill and musical creativity of the drummer. While other instrument solos such as [[guitar solo]]s are typically accompanied by the other [[rhythm section]] instruments (e.g., [[bass guitar]] and [[electric guitar]]), for most drum solos, all the other band members stop playing so that all of the audience's focus will be on the drummer. In some drum solos, the other rhythm section instrumentalists may play \"punches\" at certain points\u2013sudden, loud chords of a short duration.  Drum solos are common in [[jazz]], but they are also used in a number of [[rock music|rock]] genres, such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]].  During drum solos, drummers have a great deal of creative freedom, and drummers often use the entire drum kit. In live concerts, drummers may be given long drum solos, even in genres where drum solos are rare on singles.\n\n===Grips===\n{{main|grip (percussion)}}\n[[File:Traditional Grip.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pair of drumsticks held in traditional grip.]]\nMost drummers hold the drumsticks in one of two types of grip:\n* The [[traditional grip]], originally developed for playing the military [[side drum]], most commonly with an overhand grip for the right hand and an underhand for the left. It arose from the need to clear the counter-hoop (rim) of an angled marching drum (due to the single-point attachment of the drum sling).\n* The [[matched grip]], in which the sticks are held in similar (but [[mirror image]]) fashion.\nWithin these two types, there is still considerable variation, and even disagreements as to exactly how the stick is held in a particular method. For example, [[Jim Chapin]], an early and influential exponent of the [[Moeller method]], asserts that the technique does not rely on rebound,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG311pfsGE |title=Jim Chapin talks about the Moeller Method |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630092234/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG311pfsGE |archivedate=30 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> while [[Dave Weckl]] asserts that it does rely on rebound.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZfOLbnBwI |title=Dave Weckl \u2013 Moeller Technique |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016154321/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZfOLbnBwI |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|thumb|Neutral or ''percussion clef'', two versions]]\n\n===Notation and improvisation===\n{{main|percussion notation|music improvisation}}\nDrum kit music is either written down in [[music notation]] (called \"drum parts\"), learned and played \"[[Playing by ear|by ear]]\",  [[music improvisation|improvised]] or some combination of some or all three of these methods. Professional [[session musician]] drummers and [[Big Band]] jazz drummers are often required to read drum parts. Drum parts are most commonly written on a standard five-line [[staff (music)|staff]]. In 2016, a special ''[[percussion clef]]'' is used, while previously the [[bass clef]] was used. However, even if the bass or no clef is used, each line and space is assigned an instrument of the kit, rather than to a pitch. In [[jazz]], [[traditional music]], [[folk music]], [[rock music]] and [[pop music]], drummers are expected to be able to learn songs by ear (from a recording or from another musician who is playing or singing the song) and improvise. The degree of improvisation differs in different styles. [[Jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] drummers may have lengthy improvised solos in every song. In [[rock music]] and [[blues]], there are also drum solos in some songs, although they tend to be shorter than those in jazz. Drummers  in all [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] styles are expected to be able to improvise [[accompaniment]] parts to songs, once they are told the genre or style (e.g., [[shuffle]], [[ballad]], [[Blues|slow blues]], etc.).\n\n[[File:Sibelius drum legend.png|550px|center|thumb|Sibelius drum legend notation.{{Citation needed|reason=Doesn't conform to PAS standard.|date=February 2018}}{{Audio|Sibelius drum legend.mid|play}}]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Audio samples\n|-\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Component\n! style=\"width:160px;\"| Content\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Audio  <small>([[Vorbis]]: click the arrow to play)</small>\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Snare\n|Unmuffled snare drum\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Snare drum unmuffled.ogg]]\n|-\n|Muffled snare drum\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Snare drum muffled.ogg]]\n|-\n|Rim click (hit the rim with your drum stick) on a snare\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Snare drum rim.ogg]]\n|-\n!Bass drum\n|Muffled bass drum\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Bass drum.ogg]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Toms\n|8-inch (20&nbsp;cm) rack tom\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tom drum 8 inch.ogg]]\n|-\n|12-inch (30&nbsp;cm) rack tom\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tom 12 inch.ogg]]\n|-\n|Floor tom\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Floor tom.ogg]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Hi-hat\n|Closed hi-hat\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Hi hat closed.ogg]]\n|-\n|Open hi-hat\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Hi hat open.ogg]]\n|-\n|Hi-hat being opened and closed by its foot pedal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Hi hat foot pedal.ogg]]\n|-\n!Crash\n|Crash cymbal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Crash cymbal.ogg]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Ride\n|Hit on the ''bow''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Ride cymbal.ogg]]\n|-\n|Hit on the ''bell'' of the cymbal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Ride cymbal bell.ogg]]\n|-\n|Hit on the edge\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Ride cymbal rim.ogg]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Beat\n|A typical rock beat on hi-hat\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Rock beat hi hat.ogg]]\n|-\n|Typical rock beat on ride cymbal\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Rock beat ride cymbal.ogg]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns \n|col1=\nPeople:\n* [[Drummer]]\n* [[List of drummers]]\n\nStyles and techniques:\n* [[Drum beat]]\n* [[Jazz drumming]]\n|col2=\nOther:\n* [[Drum kit tuning]]\n* [[Percussion instrument]]\n* [[Rhythm section]]\n* [[Electronic drum]]\n* [[List of drum makers]]\n* [[Drum machine]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|breakable|shell}}\n{{commonscat|Drum-kits}}\n\n{{Drum beats}}\n{{Percussion}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum Kit}}\n[[Category:Drumming]]\n[[Category:Percussion instruments invented since 1800]]\n[[Category:Membranophones]]\n[[Category:Cymbals]]\n[[Category:North American percussion instruments]]\n[[Category:Drums]]\n[[Category:Jazz instruments]]\n[[Category:Blues instruments]]\n[[Category:Rock music instruments]]\n[[Category:Folk music instruments]]\n[[Category:Rockabilly instruments]]\n[[Category:Drum kit components| ]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\n[[Category:Occupations in music]]\n[[Category:Electronic musical instruments]]", "sha1": "n669xcyoq30jj2y1cg37cjs4zkl0wco"}}, {"title": "Dying Earth", "ns": "0", "id": "9080", "revision": {"id": "866342739", "parentid": "862187229", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T19:41:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Robop style", "id": "32565363"}, "comment": "/* Legacy */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the fantasy series|a discussion of similar works|Dying Earth (subgenre)}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Infobox book series\n| name             = ''Dying Earth''\n| image            = Compleat dying earth.jpg\n| alt              = Cover of ''The Compleat Dying Earth'' omnibus edition\n| caption          = Dust jacket of the [[#compleat|1999 omnibus edition]]\n| books            = ''[[The Dying Earth]]'' (1950)<br/> ''[[The Eyes of the Overworld]]'' (1966)<br/ >''[[Cugel's Saga]]'' (1983)<br/> ''[[Rhialto the Marvellous]]'' (1984)\n| author           = Jack Vance\n| illustrator      = \n| cover_artist     = various <br>[[Gerald Brom]], depicted<ref name=isfdb-compleat>\n{{isfdb contents |154641 |''The Compleat Dying Earth'' |(first omnibus)}}.

The Moon has disappeared and the Sun is in danger of burning out at any time, often flickering as if about to go out, before shining again. The various civilizations of Earth have collapsed for the most part into decadence or religious fanaticism and its inhabitants overcome with a fatalistic outlook. The Earth is mostly barren and cold, and has become infested with various predatory monsters (possibly created by a magician in a former age).\n\nMagic in the Dying Earth is performed by memorizing syllables, and the human brain can only accommodate a certain amount at once. When a spell is used, the syllables vanish from the caster's mind. Creatures called Sandestin can be summoned and used to perform more complex actions, but are considered dangerous to rely upon. Magic has loose links to the science of old, and advanced mathematics is treated like arcane lore. \n\nThe Dying Earth exists alongside several Overworlds and Underworlds. These help add a sense of profound longing and entrapment to the series. While humans can, with relative ease, physically travel to the horrific Underworlds (as Cugel does on several occasions, to his dismay) the vast majority of the population are only capable of mentally visiting the wondrous Overworlds through rare artifacts (IE through the \"Eyes of the Overworld\") or dangerous magic phenomena (such as the ship Cugel encounters in the deserts). Though they can look at the wonders and pretend they are really there, humans can never truly inhabit or escape to these utopia as their physical bodies remain stuck on the Dying Earth and will die with the sun regardless. These siren-like visions of paradise lead to the deaths, insanity, and suffering of many, especially during Cugel's journeys.\n\nWhile most remaining civilizations on the Dying Earth are utterly unique in their customs and cultures, there are some common threads. Because the moon is gone and wind is often weak (the sun no longer heats the earth as much) the oceans are largely placid bodies of water with no tide and tiny waves. To cross them, boats are propelled by giant sea-worms. These worms are cared for and controlled by \"Wormingers\". In addition, the manses of magicians, protected by walls and spells and monsters, are relatively common sights in inhabited lands.\n\n==Origins==\n\nVance wrote the stories of the first book while he served in the [[United States Merchant Marine]] during World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=This is Me, Jack Vance|author=Jack Vance|page=65|ISBN=978-1-59606-245-0|year=2009|publisher=Subterranen Press}}</ref> In the late 1940s several of his other stories were published in magazines.<!-- source is our biography [[Jack Vance#Work]] but were these his first written works that have been published? -->\n\n<!-- copy from our biography [[Jack Vance#Literary influences]] but what [[Dying Earth (subgenre)]] works did he read? -->\nAccording to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance's earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of [[James Branch Cabell]].<ref>Lin Carter, ''Imaginary Worlds'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1973, p. 151. {{ISBN|978-0345033093}}</ref> Fantasy historian Lin Carter has noted several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance's work, and suggests that the early \"pseudo-Cabell\" experiments bore fruit in ''The Dying Earth'' (1950).<ref>Carter, pp. 151-53.</ref>\n\n==Series==\n\nThe series comprises four books by Vance and some sequels by other authors that may be or may not have been canonical.\n\n* ''[[The Dying Earth]]'' \u2014 1950 collection of original, related stories\n* ''[[The Eyes of the Overworld]]'' \u2014 1966 fix-up\n* ''[[Cugel's Saga]]'' \u2014 1983 novel\n* ''[[Rhialto the Marvellous]]'' \u2014 1984 collection of related stories and one canonical essay\n<small>One 741-page omnibus has been issued as ''The Compleat Dying Earth'' (SF Book Club, 1999) and in both the US and UK as ''Tales of the Dying Earth'' (2000).</small><ref>ISFDB reports three different cover artists and identical contents including pagination. {{isfdb title |136498 |The Compleat Dying Earth}}. 2012-.</ref>\n\n===Stories by Vance===\n\nAll four books were published with Tables of Contents, the first and fourth as collections. The second and third contained mostly material previously published in short story form but were marketed as novels, the second as a fix-up and the third without acknowledging any previous publication.\n\n1. ''The Dying Earth'' (the author's preferred title is ''Mazirian the Magician'') was openly a collection of six stories, all original, although written during Vance's WWII service.<!-- source for the last is our article on the book --> ISFDB calls them \"slightly connected\" and catalogs the last as a novella (17,500 to 40,000 word count).<ref name=isfdb-1/>\n* \"Turjan of Miir\"\n* \"[[Mazirian the Magician]]\"\n* \"T'sais\"\n* \"[[Liane the Wayfarer]]\" (also known as \"The Loom of Darkness\")\n* \"Ulan Dhor Ends a Dream\" (also known as \"Ulan Dhor\")\n* \"Guyal of Sfere\" (It mentions a \"Lost Book of Kells\", but a later publishing changed the name as there IS a [[book of Kells]].\n\n2. ''Eyes of the Overworld'' (the author's preferred title is ''Cugel the Clever'') was a fix-up of six stories, presented as seven. All were [[novellas]] by word count (7500 to 17,500). Five were previously published as noted here.<ref name=isfdb-2/>\n* \"The Overworld\", from ''[[F&SF]]'' December 1965\n* \"Cil\" (1966), the original component\n* \"The Mountains of Magnatz\", from ''F&SF'' February 1966\n* \"The Sorcerer Pharesm\", from ''F&SF'' April 1966\n* \"The Pilgrims\", from ''F&SF'' June 1966\n* \"The Cave in the Forest\", originally the first part of \"The Manse of Iucounu\"\n* \"The Manse of Iucounu\", from ''F&SF'' July 1966\n\n3.

R. Martin]] and [[Gardner Dozois]] (Subterranean, 2009).

Wolfe suggested in ''[[The Castle of the Otter]]'', a collection of essays, that he inserted the book ''The Dying Earth'' into his fictional world under the title ''The Book of Gold'' (specifically, Wolfe wrote that the \"Book of Gold\" mentioned in ''The Book of the New Sun'' is different for each reader, but for him it was \"The Dying Earth.\")'.{{page needed |date=June 2012}} Wolfe has extended the series.<ref>{{isfdb series | |Solar Cycle}}. 2012-.</ref>\n\n[[Michael Shea (author)|Michael Shea]]'s novel ''Nifft the Lean'' (1982), his second book eight years after ''A Quest for Simbilis'', also owes much debt to Vance's creation, since the protagonist of the story is a petty thief (not unlike Cugel the Clever), who travels and struggles in an exotic world.

The [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] system, in which a wizard is limited in the number of spells that can be simultaneously remembered and forgets them once they are cast, was based on the magic of Dying Earth. In [[role-playing game]] circles, this sort of magic system is called 'Vancian' or 'Vancean'.<ref>GURPS Thaumatology- page 56</ref> Some of the spells from ''Dungeons & Dragons'' are based on spells mentioned in the ''Dying Earth'' series, such as the ''prismatic spray''. Magic items from the ''Dying Earth'' stories such as [[ioun stones]] also made their way into ''Dungeons & Dragons''. One of the deities of magic in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' is named [[Vecna]] (an anagram of Vance).<ref name=gygax/>\n\nThe [[Talislanta]] role-playing game designed by [[Stephan Michael Sechi]] and originally published in 1987 by [[Bard Games]] was inspired by the works of Jack Vance so much so that the first release, The Chronicles of Talislanta is dedicated to the author.\n\nThere is an official ''[[The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game|Dying Earth]]'' role-playing game published by [[Pelgrane Press]] with an occasional magazine ''The Excellent Prismatic Spray'' (named after a magic spell). The game situates players in Vance's world populated by desperately extravagant people. Many other role-playing settings pay homage to the series by including fantasy elements he invented such as the darkness-dwelling [[Grue (monster)|Grues]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* [[List of Dying Earth characters|List of ''Dying Earth'' characters]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n\n<ref name=isfdb-1>\n{{isfdb title |2032 |The Dying Earth}} Retrieved 2012-05-09.

The term ''dispute resolution'' may also be used interchangeably with ''[[conflict resolution]]'', where conflict styles can be used for different scenarios. \n\n==Methods==\nMethods of dispute resolution include:\n* [[lawsuit]]s (litigation)\n* [[arbitration]]\n* [[collaborative law]]\n* [[mediation]]\n* [[conciliation]]\n* [[negotiation]]\n* [[Facilitator|facilitation]]\nOne could theoretically include [[violence]] or even [[war]] as part of this spectrum, but dispute resolution practitioners do not usually do so; violence rarely ends disputes effectively, and indeed, often only escalates them. \n\nDispute resolution processes fall into two major types:\n# [[adjudication|Adjudicative]] processes, such as litigation or arbitration, in which a judge, jury or arbitrator determines the outcome.\n# Consensual processes, such as collaborative law, mediation, conciliation, or negotiation, in which the parties attempt to reach agreement.\n\nNot all disputes, even those in which skilled intervention occurs, end in resolution. Such [[intractable conflict|intractable]] disputes form a special area in dispute resolution studies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nDispute resolution is an important requirement in international trade, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation.<ref>''Global Business Environment'' (Fifth Edition) by FITT,\npages 301, 302 & 303</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Legal dispute resolution==\nThe [[legal system]] provides resolutions for many different types of disputes. Some disputants will not reach agreement through a collaborative process. Some disputes need the coercive power of the state to enforce a resolution. Perhaps more importantly, many people want a professional advocate when they become involved in a dispute, particularly if the dispute involves perceived legal rights, legal wrongdoing, or threat of legal action against them.\n\nThe most common form of judicial dispute resolution is litigation. Litigation is initiated when one party files suit against another. In the United States, litigation is facilitated by the government within federal, state, and municipal courts. The proceedings are very formal and are governed by rules, such as rules of evidence and procedure, which are established by the legislature. Outcomes are decided by an impartial [[judge]] and/or [[jury]], based on the factual questions of the case and the application law. The verdict of the court is binding, not advisory; however, both parties have the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court. Judicial dispute resolution is typically adversarial in nature, for example, involving antagonistic parties or opposing interests seeking an outcome most favorable to their position.   \n\nRetired judges or private lawyers often become arbitrators or mediators; however, trained and qualified non-legal dispute resolution specialists form a growing body within the field of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR). In the United States, many states now have mediation or other ADR programs annexed to the courts, to facilitate settlement of lawsuits.\n\n==Extrajudicial dispute resolution==\nSome use the term ''dispute resolution'' to refer only to [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR), that is, extrajudicial processes such as arbitration, collaborative law, and mediation used to resolve conflict and potential conflict between and among individuals, [[business]] entities, governmental agencies, and (in the [[public international law]] context) [[Sovereign state|states]]. ADR generally depends on agreement by the parties to use ADR processes, either before or after a dispute has arisen. ADR has experienced steadily increasing acceptance and utilization because of a perception of greater flexibility, costs below those of traditional litigation, and speedy resolution of disputes, among other perceived advantages. However, some have criticized these methods as taking away the right to seek redress of grievances in the [[court]]s, suggesting that extrajudicial dispute resolution may not offer the fairest way for parties not in an equal bargaining relationship, for example in a dispute between a [[consumer]] and a large [[corporation]]. In addition, in some circumstances, arbitration and other ADR processes may become as expensive as litigation or more so.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col begin|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Collaborative divorce]]\n* [[Conflict resolution research]]\n* [[Creative peacebuilding]]\n* [[Diplomacy]]\n* [[National Arbitration Forum]]\n* [[Party-directed mediation]]\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\n* [[Restorative justice]]\n* [[School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution]]\n* [[UN Peacemaker]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Sherwyn, David, Tracey, Bruce & Zev Eigen, \"In Defense of Mandatory Arbitration of Employment Disputes: Saving the Baby, Tossing out the Bath Water, and Constructing a New Sink in the Process\", 2 ''U.

It contains features taken from ''The Settlers of Catan'', with emphasis on city development and the use of [[knight]]s, which are used as a method of attacking other players as well as helping opponents defend Catan against a common foe.  ''Cities & Knights'' can also be combined with the ''[[Catan: Seafarers]]'' expansion or with [[Catan: Traders & Barbarians]] scenarios (again, five to six player play only possible with the applicable five to six player extension(s)).\n\n== Differences from ''The Settlers of Catan'' ==\nBecause of the new rules introduced in ''Cities & Knights'', the game is played to 13 victory points, as opposed to 10 as in the base game ''The Settlers of Catan''.\n\nThe following cards are not used in Cities & Knights:\n* the Development Cards\u2014which have been replaced by [[Catan: Cities & Knights#Progress cards|Progress Cards]].\n* the Building Cost Cards\u2014the information on these cards is provided by the [[Catan: Cities & Knights#City Upgrade Calendar|City Upgrade Calendar]].\n* the \"Largest Army\" Card\u2014having a large army is still an advantage, but does not earn victory points so directly as in the regular version of ''The Settlers of Catan''.  Instead of soldier cards, one is now able to purchase the eponymous knights.\n\n== Commodities ==\nOne of the main additions to the game is commodities, which are a type of secondary resource produced only by cities.  Like resources, commodities are associated with a type of terrain, can be stolen by the robber (with ''Seafarers'', also the pirate), count against the resource hand limit, and may not be collected if the robber is on the terrain.  Resources may be traded for commodities, and commodities may be traded for resources.  Commodities can then be used to build city improvements (provided the player has a city), which provide additional benefits.\n\nThe commodities are paper (which comes from forest terrain), coin (from mountain terrain), and cloth (from pasture terrain).\n\nWhen combining ''Cities & Knights'' with ''Barbarian Attack'', the written rules are ambiguous with regards to whether commodities are collected along with normal resources when collecting from a Gold River tile, as well as whether or not commodities can be collected directly from Gold River tiles. However, online rules state that \"Gold can only buy you resources, not commodities.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.catan.com/service/combinations/barbarian-attack-cities-and-knights|title=Combination of \"Barbarian Attack\" with \"Cities & Knights\"|website=Catan.com|date=5 December 2008|author1=von Sebastian Rapp|author2=Klaus Teuber|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nA city on grain or brick gives two of each, as in the original ''Settlers''. A city on wool, ore, or wood, produces one corresponding resource as well as one corresponding commodity (cloth, coin, or paper). Grain and brick, however, are used for new purchasing options: grain activates knights, and brick can be used to build city walls.\n\nIn total there are 36 commodity cards: 12 paper (from forest), 12 cloth (from pasture), and 12 coin (from mountains).\n\n== City improvements ==\nA player with a city may use commodities to build city improvements, which allow several advantages.  There are city improvements in five levels, and in three different categories. Each category of improvements requires a different commodity and higher levels require more cards of that commodity.  At the third level, players earn a special ability, depending on the type of improvement.\n\nThe first player with an improvement at the fourth level can claim any of their cities as a metropolis, worth four victory points instead of two for that city.  Each type of improvement has only one associated metropolis, and no city can be a metropolis of two different types (because of this, a player without a non-metropolis city may not build improvements beyond the third level).  If a player is the first to build an improvement to the final level (out-building the current holder of the metropolis), they take the metropolis from its current holder.\n\n== Knights ==\nThe other significant concept in ''Cities & Knights'' is the concept of knights, which replace the concept of soldiers and the largest army.  Knights are units that require continuous maintenance through their activation mechanism, but have a wide variety of functions.  Knights can be promoted through  three ranks, although promotion to the final rank is a special ability granted by the city improvement the Fortress.\n\nKnights are placed on the board in a similar manner to settlements, and can be used to block opposing roads, active or not.  However, knights must be activated in order to perform other functions, which immediately deactivate the knight.  Knights cannot perform actions on the same turn they are activated, but can be reactivated on the same turn as performing an action.  These actions include:\n* Moving along a road (with ''Seafarers'', a line of ships)\n* Displacing opposing knights of a lower rank, forcing the lower ranked knight to retreat\n* Dispelling the robber (with ''Seafarers'', also the pirate) if it is stationed nearby\n\nIf a knight is promoted or forced to retreat, its active status does not change.\n\nThe standard ''Cities & Knights'' game comes with 24 knights, 6 of each color. The 5/6 player extension adds a further 12 knights, 6 each of two new colors.\n\n== Barbarian attacks ==\n[[File:Deskohran\u00ed 08-10-05 077.jpg|thumb|Barbarian attack]]\n''Cities & Knights'' introduces a third die, known as the event die, which serves two functions.  The first applies to the concept of barbarians, a periodic foe that all players must work together to defend against. Three of the sides of the event die have a picture of a ship on them. The other three sides have a symbol of a city gate, allowing players who have sufficiently built up a city to obtain progress cards (see below).\n\nThe barbarians are represented by a ship positioned on a track representing the distance between the ship and Catan (i.e. the board).  Each time the event die shows a black ship, the barbarian ship takes one step closer to Catan.  When the barbarians arrive at Catan, a special phase is immediately performed before all other actions (including collecting resources).  In this special phase, the barbarians' attack strength, corresponding to the combined number of cities and metropolises held by all players, is compared to Catan's defense strength, corresponding to the combined levels (i.e. 1 point for each basic, 2 for each strong, and 3 for each mighty) of all activated knights in play.\n\nIf the barbarians are successful in their attack (if they have a strength greater than Catan), then the players must pay the consequence. The player(s) who had the least defense will be attacked, and will have one city reduced to a settlement. If they only have settlements, or metropolises, then they are immune to barbarians and do not count as the player contributing the least defense.\n\nShould Catan prevail, the player who contributes the most to Catan's defense receives a special ''Defender of Catan'' card, worth a victory point. Regardless of the outcome, all knights are immediately deactivated, and the barbarian ship returns to its starting point on the track. In the event of a tie among the greatest contributors of knights, none of the tied players earn a Defender of Catan card. Instead, each of the tied players draw a progress card (explained below) of the type of their choosing.  There are 6 Defender of Catan cards.\n\nAs the likelihood of having the barbarian move closer to Catan is very high, a variant in common usage is that the robber (and with ''Seafarers'', the pirate) does not move until the first barbarian attack, nor can a knight move the robber before that point.\n\n'''Examples where cities are lost:'''\n\n# Player A has 3 cities and 1 active strong knight. Player B has 1 city and 2 active basic knights. Player C has 2 cities and 1 active basic knight. When the barbarians attack, player C will lose one of his cities, because the attack strength (6 cities) is greater than all knights combined (5 knights).\n# Player A has 3 cities and 2 active basic knights. Player B has 1 city, which is a metropolis, and no active knights. Player C has 2 cities and 1 active mighty knight. Player B's city is a metropolis, and metropolises cannot be destroyed by the barbarians, so Player A loses a city because they have the next fewest number of active knights.\n# Player A has 2 cities and 2 active basic knights. Player B has 3 cities and 1 active strong knight. Player C has 2 cities and 2 active basic knights. All players will lose a city, because they all tie in the number of knights activated, and the barbarian attack strength (7 cities) is greater than number of active knights (6 knights).\n# Player A has 3 cities and 1 active mighty knight and 1 active basic knight. Player B has 2 cities, which both are metropolises, and 1 active basic knight. Player C has 1 city, which is a metropolis, and no active knights. First in line to lose a city is player C, but because his city is a metropolis we need to look at the person next in line. This would be player B, but the same applies for him: he has activated only 1 knight, but both of his cities are metropolises. This leaves player A to lose a city.\n\n== Progress cards ==\nThe other significant outcome of the event die is Progress cards, which replace development cards.  Because of the mechanics of progress cards explained below, one of the two white dice used in ''Settlers'' is replaced by a red die.\n\nProgress cards are organized into three categories, corresponding to the three types of improvements.  Yellow progress cards aid in commercial development, green progress cards aid in technological advancements, and blue progress cards allow for political moves.  When a castle appears on the event die, progress cards of the corresponding type may be drawn depending on the value of the red die.  Higher levels of city improvements increase the chance that progress cards will be drawn, with the highest level of city improvement allowing progress cards to be drawn regardless of the value on the red die.\n\nProgress cards, unlike the development cards they replace, can be played on the turn that they are drawn, and more than one progress card can be played per turn.  However, they can generally only be played after the dice are rolled.  Progress cards granting victory points are an exception, being played immediately (without regards to whose turn it is), while the Alchemist progress card, which allows a player to select the roll of the white and red dice, necessitates the card being played instead of rolling the numerical dice. (The event die is still rolled as normal.)\n\nPlayers are allowed to keep  four progress cards (five in a five to six player game), and any additional ones must be discarded on the spot (unless the 5th card is a victory point, which is played immediately and the original progress cards remain).  The only exception to this rule is if a player receives a 5th non-victory point progress card on his or her turn, in which case he or she has the option of playing any one of the five progress cards in his or her hand during the turn, thus bringing the progress card count back down to four.  While this clarification is not overtly stated in the Cities & Knights rule book, it is enforced in the online version of the game.\n\nIn total, there are 54 progress cards: 18 science, 18 politics, and 18 trade.\n\n== City walls ==\nCity walls are a minor addition to ''Cities & Knights'' that increase the number of resource and commodity cards a player is allowed in their hand before having to discard on a roll of 7. However, they do not protect the player from the robber or barbarians. Only cities and metropolises may have walls, and each city or metropolis can only have one wall, up to three walls per player. Each wall that the player has deployed permits the player to hold two more cards before being required to discard on a roll of seven. This results in a maximum of 13 cards.\n\nIf the barbarians pillage your city, then the city wall is also destroyed and the wall is removed from the board.\n\nThe game comes with 12 city walls, 3 of each color.\n\n== The Merchant ==\nThe merchant is another addition to ''Cities & Knights''.  Like the robber, the merchant is placed on a single land hex.  Unlike the robber, the merchant has a beneficial effect.\n\nThe merchant can only be deployed through the use of a Merchant progress card (of which there are six), on a land hex near a city or a settlement.  The player with the control of the merchant can trade the resource (not commodity) of that type at a two-to-one rate, as if the player had a control of a corresponding two-to-one harbor.\n\nThe player with the control of the merchant also earns a victory point.  Both the victory point and the trade privilege are lost if another player takes control of the merchant.\n\n== City Upgrade Calendar ==\nIn place of ''The Settlers of Catan'' standard improvement cost card, ''Cities & Knights'' gives a calendar type flip-chart to each player, of course still matching that players color. The top of the chart has the standard costs from the ''Settlers'' game (for settlements, upgrade to city, and roads). It does not include the Development Card cost as those cards are not used in a ''Cities & Knights'' game. It does include the costs of hiring a knight, upgrading a knight's level or strength, and the cost to activate a knight. It also includes the cost of a ship, which are not used in a regular game of ''Cities & Knights'', but presumably this is to cater for players who have combined ''Cities & Knights'' and ''Seafarers''.\n\nThose are only the rudimentary costs of the game however. The calendar also shows the costs of the next city improvement in each of the three categories&nbsp;\u2014 as a city is improved in a category, that segment has its card flipped down calendar style to reveal the newly built improvement, any advantages gained by the improvement, and the updated cost of upgrading to the next level in that category. Each segment, as it is flipped down, also shows the updated dice pattern needed to earn the player a progress card in that category.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{bgg|926}}\n* Official [http://www.catan.com/ website] of the author Klaus Teuber\n* Official PC version of [http://www.playcatan.com/ ''Catan - Cities & Knights'']\n* [http://www.catan.com/gamerules.html Official C&K rules]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}The official website for the world of Catan.

The main feature of this expansion is the addition of ships, gold rivers, and the pirate to the game, allowing play between multiple islands.  The expansion also provides numerous scenarios, some of which have custom rules.  The ''Seafarers'' rules and scenarios are also, for the most part, compatible with ''[[Catan: Cities & Knights]]'' and ''[[Catan: Traders & Barbarians]]''.\n\nThe concepts introduced in ''Seafarers'' were part of designer [[Klaus Teuber]]'s original design for ''Settlers''.\n\n==Ships==\n''Seafarers'' introduces the concept of ships, which serve as roads over water or along the coast.  Each ship costs one lumber and one wool to create (lumber for the hull and wool for the sails).  A settlement must first be built before a player can switch from building roads to building ships, or vice versa.  Thus, a chain of ships is always anchored at a settlement on the coast.  A shipping line that is not anchored at both ends by different settlements can also move the last ship at the open end, although this can only be done once per turn and may not be done with any ships that were created on the same turn.\n\nThe \"Longest Road\" card is now renamed the \"Longest Trade Route\" since this is now calculated by counting the number of contiguous ships ''plus'' roads that a player has. A settlement or city is necessary between a road and a ship for the two to be considered continuous for the purposes of this card.\n\nThe Road Building card allows a player to build 2 roads, 2 ships, or one of each when used.\n\nAlong with the concept of ships, ''Seafarers'' also introduces the notion of the pirate, which acts as a waterborne robber which steals from nearby ships (similar to how the robber steals from nearby settlements).  The pirate can also prevent ships from being built or moved nearby, but it does not interfere with harbors.\n\nWhen a seven is rolled or a Knight card is played, the player may move either the robber OR the pirate.\n\n==Gold Rivers==\n''Seafarers'' also introduces the \"Gold River\" terrain, which grants nearby players one resource of their choice for every settlement adjacent to a gold tile and 2 resources for every city.  Since being able to choose any resource type allows more building power, gold rivers are either marked with number token of only 2 or 3 dots and/or are far away from starting positions to offset this.\n\nWhen combined with ''Cities & Knights'', the rules state that you are not allowed to take commodities instead of resources if a city is nearby.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Exploration==\nSome scenarios have extra rules encompassing the concept of exploration, which is done by having the hex tiles placed face down.  Should a player build next to unexplored terrain, the terrain tile is turned face up, and the player is rewarded with a resource should the tile revealed be resource-producing.  In other scenarios, the board is divided into islands, and if the player builds a settlement on an island other than the ones they begin on, the settlement is worth extra victory points.\n\nThe ''Cities and Knights'' manual recommends that players not use the ''Cities & Knights'' rules in scenarios where exploration is a factor.\n\n==Scenarios==\nUnlike ''The Settlers of Catan'' and ''Catan: Cities & Knights'', in which the only random element of setup is the placement of land tiles, number tokens, and harbors in an identically-shaped playing area, ''Catan: Seafarers'' has a number of different scenarios or maps from which to choose.  Each map uses a different selection of tiles laid out in a specific pattern, which may not use all of the tiles. Other attributes also set each map apart, for example, restrictions on the placement of initial settlements, whether tiles are distributed randomly, the number of victory points needed to win, and special victory point awards, usually for building on islands across the sea.\n\n''Seafarers'' provides scenarios for three or four players (the older fourth edition used the same maps for three- and four-player versions of the scenarios), while the extension provides scenarios for six players (the older third edition also included separate maps for five- and six-player scenarios).  The scenarios between the older editions of ''Seafarers'' and the newest are generally incompatible, knowing the different frames included with the game.  (In particular, older editions of ''Settlers'' did not come with a frame for their board; a separate add-on was made available for players of the older-edition ''Settlers'' games, containing the newer edition frames, so as to make them compatible with the newer edition of ''Seafarers''; the older edition of ''Seafarers'' included a square frame, and while both older and newer editions of the frames have the same width across, the newer editions are not square-shaped, and are longer down the middle of the board compared to the sides.)\n\n===Heading to New Shores===\n''Heading to New Shores'' (''New Shores'' in older editions) is the scenario resembling Teuber's original design for the game.  The game board consists of the main ''Settlers'' island as well as a few smaller islands, which award a special victory point to each player for their first settlements on them.  This scenario is meant for players new to ''Seafarers'', with elements of ''Seafarers'' incorporated into the more familiar main board.\n\n===The Four Islands===\n''The Four Islands'' is the first scenario introduced where new mechanics introduced to ''Seafarers'' is brought into the forefront.  In this scenario, the map is split up into four islands of roughly equal size and resource distribution.  (The six-player version found in the extension has the map split into six islands; the scenario is titled ''The Six Islands'', but is played identically.  Older editions of the extension had a five-player version with five islands, called ''The Five Islands''.)  Players may claim up to two of the islands as their home islands, and settling on any of the other islands awards a special victory point.\n\n===The Fog Island===\n''The Fog Island'' (''Oceans'' in older editions) is the first scenario where exploration is used.  The board starts off with a portion of the map left blank: when players expand into the blank region, terrain hexes are drawn at random from a supply and placed in the empty space, and, if a land hex is \"discovered\", a number token may be assigned.  As a reward for discovering land, the player making the discovery is rewarded with a bonus resource card corresponding to the type of land hex discovered.\n\n===Through the Desert===\n''Through the Desert'' (''Into the Desert'' in older edition) is similar to ''The Four Islands'', but consists of a large continent and smaller outlying islands.  On the large island, there exists a \"wall of deserts\" that separates the island into a large main area and separate smaller strips of land.  As the name of the scenario implies, expanding through the desert into these smaller strips of land, or by sea to the outlying islands, award bonus victory points.\n\n===The Forgotten Tribe===\n''The Forgotten Tribe'', originally titled ''Friendly Neighbors'', was a downloadable scenario (but only in the German language) which was incorporated into newer editions of ''Seafarers''.\n\nThe map consists of a main island and smaller outlying islands, where the namesake forgotten tribe resides.  Players may not expand into the outlying islands, but by building ships so that they border the outlying islands, players may be awarded with victory points, development cards, or harbors that players may place on the coast of the main island at a later time.\n\n===Cloth for Catan===\nIntroduced in the newer editions, ''Cloth for Catan'' continues the adventures with the Forgotten Tribe.  The scenario was previously available for older editions as a downloadable scenario (but only in German), titled ''Coffee for Catan''.\n\nPlayers begin with settlements on the outside of the map, but may build ships to reach the Forgotten Tribe's islands, which are in the center.  By connecting to the Forgotten Tribe's settlements (represented by number tokens), players may earn cloth tokens when the number token for the Forgotten Tribe's villages are rolled.  Cloth tokens, in turn, are worth one victory point for each pair obtained.\n\n===The Pirate Island===\n''The Pirate Island'', introduced in newer editions, is the first scenario which changes the mechanics of new gameplay elements introduced in ''Seafarers''.  ''The Pirate Island'' had previously been available as a downloadable scenario (but only in German) suitable for the older editions.\n\nIn this scenario, players begin with a pre-placed settlement on a main island.  Ships may only be built in one single line, which must pass through a fixed waypoint (different for each player) en route to a pirate fortress (each player has their own pirate fortress).  Once ships connect to the pirate fortress, they may attempt to attack the pirate fortress once per turn.  Ships may be lost if the attack is unsuccessful, but after three successful attacks, the pirate fortress is converted into a settlement.  Players must convert their pirate fortresses and have 10 victory points before being able to claim victory.\n\nFurthermore, the pirate mechanics have also changed: the pirate moves through the middle of the map in a fixed path every turn, and attacks the owner of any nearby settlements.  Players win resources if they are able to fend off the pirate attack (which depends on the number rolled by the dice, as well as the number of warships in the defending player's possession; warships are created from using Knight cards on existing ships), but lose resources if they are unsuccessful.  Maritime expansion is only permitted by building a settlement at the waypoint, however, this increases the chances of a pirate attack.\n\n===The Wonders of Catan===\n''The Wonders of Catan'' was a downloadable scenario for older editions of ''Seafarers'' in both German and English, and was incorporated into ''Seafarers'' in newer editions.\n\nIn this scenario, there are a number of \"wonders\", each with a large cost of building as well as a prerequisite.  If a player meets the prerequisite for a wonder, they may claim the wonder for themselves.  A player may only claim one wonder, and each wonder may only be claimed by one player.  Wonders must be built in four parts, and each wonder has a different build cost.  The winner is the first player to complete their wonder, or the first player to have 10 victory points and have more parts of their wonder complete than any other player.\n\n===The Great Crossing===\n''The Great Crossing'' was a scenario in the older editions of ''Seafarers'', which has been dropped in newer editions.  The map is divided into two islands, Catan and Transcatania.  Players begin with both settlements on one of the islands, and must build ships connecting settlements between the two islands.  Players earn victory points for connecting their settlements with settlements (not necessarily theirs) from the opposite island using ships, or to another player's shipping lines which connect two settlements together.\n\n===Greater Catan===\n''Greater Catan'' was a scenario included in the older editions of ''Seafarers'' but is not included in newer editions.  Due to the sheer amounts of equipment needed, two copies of ''Settlers'' and ''Seafarers'' are required to set up this scenario.  The map consists of a standard ''Settlers'' island, along with a smaller chain of outlying islands.  Only the main island initially has number tokens: number tokens are assigned to the outlying islands as they are expanded.  However, the supply of number tokens is smaller than the number of hexes in the scenario: when the number tokens run out and players expand into a new part of the outlying islands, number tokens are moved from the main island to the outlying islands.\n\nHexes on the main island for which there are no number tokens do not produce resources, but number tokens are moved in such a way so as to avoid rendering a city unproductive; furthermore, whenever possible number tokens must be reassigned from hexes bordering a player's own settlements and cities, so as to prevent harming another player's economy without harming a player's own economy at the same time.\n\n===New World===\n''New World'' is a scenario that blankets all other scenarios that may be created from the parts of ''Settlers'' and ''Seafarers''.  This scenario uses an entirely random map, and players are encouraged to try and create a tile layout that plays well.  The only difference between versions in ''Seafarers'', the extension, and the older editions therein is the size of the frames.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Settlers of Catan]]''\n*''[[Catan: Cities & Knights]]''\n*''[[Catan: Traders & Barbarians]]''\n\n==References==\n\n{{cite web|title=University Of Catan: Seafarers Of Catan|url=http://www.universityofcatan.com/soc-games/soce.html|accessdate=2006-02-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215202908/http://universityofcatan.com/soc-games/soce.html|archivedate=2005-12-15|df=}}\n\n{{Catan navbox}}\n\n[[Category:The Settlers of Catan]]\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1997]]\n\n[[it:Marinai]]\n[[pl:\u017beglarze z Catanu]]", "sha1": "ocel919rd2l0v0gr4iz4etehjv5m1fl"}}, {"title": "Dynamical system", "ns": "0", "id": "9087", "revision": {"id": "862630052", "parentid": "862582124", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T16:42:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Anita5192", "id": "13220696"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Undid revision 862582124 by [[Special:Contributions/14.245.35.1|14.245.35.1]] ([[User talk:14.245.35.1|talk]])rvv", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the general aspects of dynamical systems|technical details|Dynamical system (definition)|the study|Dynamical systems theory}}\n{{Redirect|Dynamical}}\n[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] arises in the study of the [[Lorenz Oscillator]], a dynamical system.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''dynamical system''' is a system in which a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] describes the [[time]] dependence of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[Manifold|geometrical space]].

Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of [[chaos theory]], [[logistic map]] dynamics, [[bifurcation theory]], the [[self-assembly]] process, and the [[edge of chaos]] concept.\n\n==Overview==\nThe concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]].  There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future.  (The relation is either a [[differential equation]], [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]] or other [[Time scale calculus|time scale]].)  To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times&mdash;each advancing time a small step.  The iteration procedure is referred to as ''solving the system'' or ''integrating the system''. If the system can be solved, given an initial point it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a ''[[trajectory]]'' or ''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''.\n\nBefore the advent of [[computers]], finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems.  Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.\n\nFor simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories.  The difficulties arise because:\n* The systems studied may only be known approximately&mdash;the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations.  The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions.  To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as [[Lyapunov stability]] or [[structural stability]].  The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] changes with the different notions of stability.\n* The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory.  Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class.  Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. [[Linear dynamical system]]s and [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem|systems that have two numbers describing a state]] are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.\n* The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes.  For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Turbulence|transition to turbulence of a fluid]].\n* The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random.  In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories.  The averages are well defined for [[ergodic theory|ergodic systems]] and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [[Anosov diffeomorphism|hyperbolic systems]]. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and of [[chaos theory|chaos]].\n\n==History==\n\nMany people regard [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] as the founder of dynamical systems.<ref>Holmes, Philip. \"Poincar\u00e9, celestial mechanics, dynamical-systems theory and \"chaos\".\" ''Physics Reports'' 193.3 (1990): 137-163.</ref> Poincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the [[Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem]], which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.\n\n[[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamic system.\n\nIn 1913, [[George David Birkhoff]] proved Poincar\u00e9's \"[[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Birkhoff theorem|Last Geometric Theorem]]\", a special case of the [[three-body problem]], a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his ''[http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll9/ Dynamical Systems]''Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the [[ergodic theorem]]. Combining insights from [[physics]] on the [[ergodic hypothesis]] with [[measure theory]], this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of [[statistical mechanics]]. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.\n\n[[Stephen Smale]] made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.\n\n[[Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky]] developed [[Sharkovsky's theorem]] on the periods of [[discrete dynamical system]]s in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the [[real line]] has a [[periodic point]] of period&nbsp;3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.\n\n==Basic definitions==\n{{Main|Dynamical system (definition)}}\nA dynamical system is a [[manifold]] ''M'' called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions \u03a6<sup>''t''</sup> that for any element of ''t'' \u2208 ''T'', the time, map a point of the [[phase space]] back into the phase space.  The notion of smoothness changes with applications and the type of manifold.  There are several choices for the set&nbsp;''T''.  When ''T'' is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called a ''[[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]''; and if ''T'' is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a ''semi-flow''. When ''T'' is taken to be the integers, it is a ''cascade'' or a ''map''; and the restriction to the non-negative integers is a ''semi-cascade''.\n\n=== Examples ===\nThe evolution function \u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup> is often the solution of a ''differential equation of motion''\n\n:  <math> \\dot{x} = v(x). </math>\n\nThe equation gives the time derivative, represented by the dot, of a trajectory ''x''(''t'') on the phase space starting at some point&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>.  The [[vector field]] ''v''(''x'') is a smooth function that at every point of the phase space ''M'' provides the velocity vector of the dynamical system at that point. (These vectors are not vectors in the phase space&nbsp;''M'', but in the [[tangent space]] ''T<sub>x</sub>M'' of the point&nbsp;''x''.)  Given a smooth \u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup>, an autonomous vector field can be derived from it.\n\nThere is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for time dependence in ''v''(''x'') because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.  Other types of [[differential equations]] can be used to define the evolution rule:\n\n: <math> G(x, \\dot{x}) = 0 </math>\n\nis an example of an equation that arises from the modeling of mechanical systems with complicated constraints.\n\nThe differential equations determining the evolution function \u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup> are often [[ordinary differential equation]]s; in this case the phase space ''M'' is a finite dimensional manifold.  Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds&mdash;those that are locally [[Banach space]]s&mdash;in which case the differential equations are [[partial differential equation]]s.  In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity.\n\n=== Further examples ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Logistic map]]\n* [[Complex quadratic polynomial]]\n* [[Dyadic transformation]]\n* [[Tent map]]\n* [[Double pendulum]]\n* [[Arnold's cat map]]\n* [[Horseshoe map]]\n* [[Baker's map]] is an example of a chaotic [[piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]] map\n* [[Dynamical billiards|Billiards]] and [[Dynamical outer billiards|outer billiards]]\n* [[H\u00e9non map]]\n* [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz system]]\n* [[Circle map]]\n* [[R\u00f6ssler map]]\n* [[Kaplan\u2013Yorke map]]\n* [[List of chaotic maps]]\n* [[Swinging Atwood's machine]]\n* [[Quadratic Map Simulation System|Quadratic map simulation system]]\n* [[Bouncing ball dynamics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Linear dynamical systems==\n{{Main|Linear dynamical system}}\nLinear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified.  In a linear system the phase space is the ''N''-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with ''N'' numbers.  The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a [[superposition principle]]: if ''u''(''t'') and ''w''(''t'') satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will ''u''(''t'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''w''(''t'').\n\n===Flows===\nFor a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], the vector field \u03a6(''x'') is an [[affine transformation|affine]] function of the position in the phase space, that is,\n:  <math> \\dot{x} = \\phi(x) = A x + b,</math>\nwith ''A'' a matrix, ''b'' a vector of numbers and ''x'' the position vector.  The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).\nThe case ''b''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0 with ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is just a straight line in the direction of&nbsp;''b'':\n\n: <math>\\Phi^t(x_1) = x_1 + b t. </math>\n\nWhen ''b'' is zero and ''A''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, then the orbit remains there.\nFor other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the [[matrix exponential|exponential of a matrix]]: for an initial point ''x''<sub>0</sub>,\n\n:  <math>\\Phi^t(x_0) = e^{t A} x_0. </math>\n\nWhen ''b'' = 0, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' determine the structure of the phase space.  From the eigenvalues and the [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.\n\nThe distance between two different initial conditions in the case ''A''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast.  Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]].\n\n[[File:LinearFields.png|thumb|500px|center|Linear vector fields and a few trajectories.]]\n{{-}}\n\n===Maps===\nA [[Discrete-time dynamical system|discrete-time]], [[Affine transformation|affine]] dynamical system has the form of a [[matrix difference equation]]:\n: <math> x_{n+1} =  A x_n + b, </math>\nwith ''A'' a matrix and ''b'' a vector.  As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates ''x''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''A'')<sup>&nbsp;&ndash;1</sup>''b'' removes the term ''b'' from the equation. In the new [[coordinate system]], the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system ''A''<sup>&nbsp;''n''</sup>''x''<sub>0</sub>.\nThe solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space.  The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.\n\nAs in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ''A'' determine the structure of phase space.  For example, if ''u''<sub>1</sub> is an eigenvector of ''A'', with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along ''\u03b1''&nbsp;''u''<sub>1</sub>, with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R''', is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.\n\nThere are also many [[List of chaotic maps|other discrete dynamical systems]].\n\n==Local dynamics==\nThe qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative):   a ''singular point'' of the vector field (a point where&nbsp;''v''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a ''periodic orbit'' is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop.  It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.\n\n===Rectification===\nA flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple.  If ''y'' is a point where the vector field ''v''(''y'')&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around ''y'' where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude.  This is known as the rectification theorem.\n\nThe ''rectification theorem'' says that away from [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]] the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line.  The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space ''M'' the dynamical system is ''integrable''.  In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space.  There may be singular points in the vector field (where ''v''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.\n\n===Near periodic orbits===\nIn general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used.  Poincar\u00e9 developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point ''x''<sub>0</sub> in the orbit \u03b3 and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to ''v''(''x''<sub>0</sub>).  These points are a [[Poincar\u00e9 section]]  ''S''(''\u03b3'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the [[Poincar\u00e9 map]] ''F''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''S'', for points starting in ''S'' and returning to&nbsp;''S''.  Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nThe intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincar\u00e9 section is a fixed point of the Poincar\u00e9 map ''F''. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. The Taylor series of the map is ''F''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''J''&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;O(''x''<sup>2</sup>), so a change of coordinates ''h'' can only be expected to simplify ''F'' to its linear part\n\n: <math> h^{-1} \\circ F \\circ h(x) = J \\cdot x.</math>\n\nThis is known as the conjugation equation.  Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems.  Poincar\u00e9 first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition.  If ''\u03bb''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''\u03bb''<sub>''\u03bd''</sub> are the eigenvalues of ''J'' they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others.  As terms of the form ''\u03bb''<sub>''i''</sub> &ndash; \u2211 (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function ''h'', the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.\n\n===Conjugation results===\nThe results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of ''J'' and the degree of smoothness required from ''h''.  As ''J'' does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers.  When the eigenvalues of ''J'' are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point ''x''<sub>0</sub> of ''F'' is called ''[[Hyperbolic fixed point|hyperbolic]]'' and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called ''elliptic''.\n\nIn the hyperbolic case, the [[Hartman\u2013Grobman theorem]] gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map ''J''&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;''x''. The hyperbolic case is also ''structurally stable''.  Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincar\u00e9 map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of ''J'' in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.\n\nThe [[Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser theorem|Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser (KAM)]] theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.\n\n==Bifurcation theory==\n{{Main|Bifurcation theory}}\nWhen the evolution map \u03a6<sup>''t''</sup> (or the [[vector field]] it is derived from) depends on a parameter \u03bc, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the [[phase space]] until a special value ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> is reached.  At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.\n\nBifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a periodic orbit, or an invariant [[torus]]) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter&nbsp;''\u03bc''. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures.  By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.\n\nThe bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point ''x''<sub>0</sub> of a system family ''F<sub>\u03bc</sub>'' can be characterized by the [[eigenvalues]] of the first derivative of the system ''DF''<sub>''\u03bc''</sub>(''x''<sub>0</sub>) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of ''DF<sub>\u03bc</sub>'' on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on [[Bifurcation theory]].\n\nSome bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the [[Ruelle&ndash;Takens scenario]] describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a [[strange attractor]]. In another example, [[Bifurcation diagram|Feigenbaum period-doubling]] describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of [[period-doubling bifurcation]]s.\n\n==Ergodic systems==\n{{Main|Ergodic theory}}\nIn many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a \u03bd-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant.  This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position)&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(momentum).  The flow takes points of a subset ''A'' into the points \u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup>(''A'') and invariance of the phase space means that\n: <math> \\mathrm{vol} (A) = \\mathrm{vol} ( \\Phi^t(A) ). </math>\nIn the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]], given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow.  The volume is said to be computed by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville measure]].\n\nIn a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible.  The states with the same energy form an energy shell \u03a9, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.\n\nFor systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincar\u00e9 discovered the [[Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem|recurrence theorem]]: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let ''F'' be a phase space volume-preserving map and ''A'' a subset of the phase space.  Then almost every point of ''A'' returns to ''A'' infinitely often.  The Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem was used by [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]] to object to [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.\n\nOne of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the [[ergodic hypothesis]].  The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region ''A'' is vol(''A'')/vol(\u03a9).\n\nThe ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of [[statistical mechanics]] and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems.  [[Bernard Koopman|Koopman]] approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of [[functional analysis]].  An observable ''a'' is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height).  The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function \u03c6<sup>&nbsp;t</sup>.  This introduces an operator ''U''<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup>, the [[transfer operator]],\n\n: <math> (U^t a)(x) = a(\\Phi^{-t}(x)). </math>\n\nBy studying the spectral properties of the linear operator ''U'' it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of&nbsp;\u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup>.  In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving \u03a6<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup> gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving&nbsp;''U''.\n\nThe Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface \u03a9 is the basis for the averages computed in [[Statistical mechanics|equilibrium statistical mechanics]].  An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the  [[Statistical mechanics#Canonical ensemble|Boltzmann factor exp(&minus;\u03b2''H'')]].  This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. [[SRB measure]]s replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.\n\n===Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos===\n{{Main|Chaos theory}}\nSimple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called ''[[chaos theory|chaos]]''. [[Anosov diffeomorphism|Hyperbolic systems]] are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems.  In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the ''stable manifold'') and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the ''unstable manifold'').\n\nThis branch of [[mathematics]] deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like \"Will the system settle down to a [[steady state]] in the long term, and if so, what are the possible [[attractor]]s?\" or \"Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?\"\n\nNote that the chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. [[Meteorology]] has been known for years to involve complex&mdash;even chaotic&mdash;behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The [[logistic map]] is only a second-degree polynomial; the [[horseshoe map]] is piecewise linear.\n\n=== Geometrical definition ===\nA dynamical system is the tuple <math> \\langle \\mathcal{M}, f , \\mathcal{T}\\rangle </math>, with <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> a manifold (locally a Banach space or Euclidean space), <math>\\mathcal{T}</math> the domain for time (non-negative reals, the integers, ...) and ''f'' an evolution rule ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''f''<sup>&nbsp;''t''</sup> (with <math>t\\in\\mathcal{T}</math>) such that ''f<sup>&nbsp;t</sup>'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] of the manifold to itself. So, f is a mapping of the time-domain <math> \\mathcal{T}</math> into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, ''f''(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, for every time ''t'' in the domain <math> \\mathcal{T}</math> .\n\n=== Measure theoretical definition ===\n{{main|Measure-preserving dynamical system}}\nA dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a [[sigma-algebra]], the quadruplet (''X'', \u03a3, \u03bc, \u03c4). Here, ''X'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], and \u03a3 is a [[sigma-algebra]] on ''X'', so that the pair (''X'', \u03a3) is a measurable space. \u03bc is a finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (''X'', \u03a3, \u03bc) is a [[measure space|probability space]]. A map \u03c4: ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' is said to be [[measurable function|\u03a3-measurable]] if and only if, for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, one has <math>\\tau^{-1}\\sigma \\in \\Sigma</math>. A map \u03c4 is said to '''preserve the measure''' if and only if, for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, one has <math>\\mu(\\tau^{-1}\\sigma ) = \\mu(\\sigma)</math>. Combining the above, a map \u03c4 is said to be a '''measure-preserving transformation of ''X'' ''', if it is a map from ''X'' to itself, it is \u03a3-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (''X'', \u03a3, \u03bc, \u03c4), for such a \u03c4, is then defined to be a '''dynamical system'''.\n\nThe map \u03c4 embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the [[iterated function|iterates]] <math>\\tau^n=\\tau \\circ \\tau \\circ \\cdots\\circ\\tau</math> for integer ''n'' are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map \u03c4 is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.\n\n== Examples of dynamical systems ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arnold's cat map]]\n* [[Baker's map]] is an example of a chaotic piecewise linear map\n* [[Circle map]]\n* [[Double pendulum]]\n* [[Dynamical billiards|Billiards]] and [[Dynamical outer billiards|Outer billiards]]\n* [[H\u00e9non map]]\n* [[Horseshoe map]]\n* [[Irrational rotation]]\n* [[List of chaotic maps]]\n* [[Logistic map]]\n* [[Lorenz attractor|Lorenz system]]\n* [[Rossler map]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Multidimensional generalization ==\nDynamical systems are defined over a single independent variable, usually thought of as time.

Sura 9 ([[At-Tawba]]), [[At-Tawba 29|verse 29]] stipulates that ''jizya'' be exacted from non-Muslims as a condition required for jihad to cease. Failure to pay the ''jizya'' could result in the pledge of protection of a dhimmi's life and property becoming void, with the dhimmi facing the alternatives of conversion, enslavement, death or imprisonment, as advocated by [[Abu Yusuf]], the chief [[qadi]] (Islamic judge) of [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] who ruled over much of modern-day [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"lewis1415\">Lewis (1984), pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nLewis states there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of a burden jizya was.<ref name=\"lewis1415\"/> According to [[Norman Stillman]]: \"''jizya'' and ''[[kharaj]]'' were a \"crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy.\"<ref>Stillman (1979), p. 28</ref> Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam.<ref name=autogenerated1>Lewis (1984), p. 17\u201318; Stillman (1979), p. 18</ref> However, in some regions the jizya on populations was significantly lower than the zakat, meaning dhimmi populations maintained an economic advantage.<ref>Klorman (2007), p. 94</ref> According to Cohen, taxation, from the perspective of dhimmis who came under Muslim rule, was \"a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes\".<ref name=\"Cahen\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2016}} [[Bernard Lewis|Lewis]] observes that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was welcomed by many among the dhimmis who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters, and that some, even among the Christians of Syria and Egypt, preferred the rule of Islam to that of Byzantines.<ref name=\"Lewis p57\">Lewis (2002) p. 57</ref> [[William Montgomery Watt|Montgomery Watt]] states, \"the Christians were probably better off as dhimmis under Muslim-Arab rulers than they had been under the Byzantine Greeks.\"<ref>[[William Montgomery Watt]], ''Islamic Political Thought: The Basic Concepts'', p. 51.

By God, Muslims would not find a man to talk to and profit from his labors.\"<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nIslamic jurists required adult, free, healthy males among the dhimma community to pay the jizya, while exempting women, children, the elderly, slaves, those affected by mental or physical handicaps, and travelers who did not settle in Muslim lands.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Mirza|first1 = editor, Gerhard Bowering ; associate editors, Patricia Crone ...

However, dhimmis frequently attended the Muslim courts in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were taken out against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi's own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce or inheritance to the Muslim courts so these cases would be decided under sharia law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis' beliefs.<ref name=\"al-Qattan-99 2\">al-Qattan (1999)</ref>\n\nMuslim men could generally marry dhimmi women who are considered People of the Book, however Islamic jurists rejected the possibility any non-Muslim man might marry a Muslim woman.<ref>Al-Mawardi (2000), p. 161; Friedmann (2003), p. 161; Lewis (1984), p. 27.</ref> Bernard Lewis notes that \"similar position existed under the laws of Byzantine Empire, according to which a Christian could marry a Jewish woman, but a Jew could not marry a Christian woman under pain of death\".<ref name=\"Lewis 1984, p. 27\"/>\n\n==Relevant texts==\n\n===Quranic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis===\nLewis states\n* The phrase \"Let there be no compulsion in religion: ...\", from ''[[sura]]'' 2 ([[Al-Baqara]]), ''[[ayah]]'' 256,<ref>{{cite quran|2|256|s=ns}}</ref> has sometimes been interpreted in the Islamic legal and theological traditions to mean followers of other religions should not be forced to adopt Islam <ref name=\"Lewis14\">Lewis (1984) p. 13</ref> \n* The phrase \"Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\", from sura 109 ([[Al-Kafirun]]), ayah 6,<ref>{{cite quran|109|6|s=ns}}</ref> has been used as a \"proof-text for pluralism and coexistence\".<ref name=\"Lewis14\" />\n* Sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayah 62<ref>{{cite quran|2|62|s=ns}}</ref> has served to justify the tolerated position accorded to the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Sabianism under Muslim rule.<ref name=\"Lewis14\" />\n\n===Hadith===\n\nA hadith by Muhammad, \"Whoever killed a ''Mu'ahid'' (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).\",<ref>{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|49}}</ref><ref name=\"Tahir-ul-Qadri1\">{{cite book|first1=Muhammad|last1=Tahir-ul-Qadri|authorlink=Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri|date=2011|title=[[Fatwa on Terrorism|Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings]]|page=99|publisher=[[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK|London: Minhaj-ul-Quran]]|isbn=978-0-9551888-9-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Yaser|last1=Ellethy|date=2014|title=Islam, Context, Pluralism and Democracy: Classical and Modern Interpretations ''(Islamic Studies Series)''|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1138800309|pages=124\u20135}}</ref>  is considered to be a foundation for the protection of the People of the Book in Muslim ruled countries.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Anwar Shah Kashmiri writes in his commentary on [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] ''Fayd al-Bari'' on this hadith: \"You know the gravity of sin for killing a Muslim, for its odiousness has reached the point of disbelief, and it necessitates that [the killer abides in Hell] forever.

The [[Constitution of Medina]], a formal agreement between Muhammad and all the significant tribes and families of Medina (including Muslims, Jews and pagans), declared that non-Muslims in the [[Ummah]] had the following rights:<ref>Ahmed (1979), pp. 46\u20137.</ref>\n# The security (''dhimma'') of God is equal for all groups,<ref>Article 15, as quoted in Ahmed (1979), pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n# Non-Muslim members have equal political and cultural rights as Muslims.

However, Western [[orientalism|orientalists]] doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the [[Theodosian dynasty|Theodosian]] and [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian Codes]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Umar II]] or by the early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphs.<ref>Lewis (1984), pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n==Cultural interactions and cultural differences==\nDuring the Middle Ages, local associations known as ''[[futuwwa]]'' clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves \u2013 to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or [[Emir|amir]].<ref>[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 2''.

The Doctor V64 also had the ability to play [[Video CD]]s, audio CDs and had an option for applying stereo 3D effects to the audio.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Doctor V64 came out in 1996 and was priced around $450 USD.<ref name=\"V64\">{{cite news|title=Nintendo Pirating Device Still for Sale|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/06/4504|accessdate=January 31, 2016|newspaper=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|date=June 18, 1997|author=Obser, Jeffrey|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105112709/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/06/4504|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> Many third party developers used the V64 instead of the [[PC64 Development Kit]] sold by [[Nintendo]]; the V64 was considered an attractive, low-cost alternative to the expensive N64 development machine, which was manufactured by [[Silicon Graphics]] at the time. The [[Central processing unit|CPU]] of the V64 is a [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] chip (the CPU from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]); the operating system is stored in the [[BIOS]] chip. It is likely that Bung reused most of the design of their earlier NES clones in the Doctor V64.\n\nThe Doctor V64 unit contains a CD-ROM drive which sits underneath the Nintendo 64 and plugs into the expansion slot on the underside of the Nintendo 64. The expansion slot is essentially a mirror image of the cartridge slot on the top of the unit, with the same electrical connections, thus the Nintendo 64 reads data from the Doctor V64 in the same manner as it would from a cartridge plugged into the normal slot.\n\nUsing the Doctor V64 involved the solution of two problems: how to boot a game and how to save. In order to get around Nintendo's [[10NES|lockout chip]], when using the Doctor V64 a game cartridge is plugged into the Nintendo 64 through an adaptor which connects only the lockout chip. The game cart used for operation had to contain the same lockout chip used by the game backup. The second problem concerned saving progress. Most N64 games saved to the cart itself instead of external memory cards. If the player wanted to keep their progress then the cartridge used had to have the same type of non-volatile memory hardware.\n\nFollowing the Doctor V64's success, Bung released the Doctor V64 Jr. in December 1998. This was a cost-efficient condensed version of the original V64. The V64jr had no CD drive and plugged into the normal cartridge slot on the top of the Nintendo 64. Data was loaded into the V64jr's battery-backed RAM from a PC via a [[parallel port]] connection. The V64Jr had up to 512 megabits (64 MB) of memory storage. At the time this was done to provide for future Nintendo 64 carts that employed larger memory storage. The prohibitive high costs associated with ordering large storage carts kept this occurrence at a minimum. Only a handful of 512 megabit games were released for the Nintendo 64 system.\n\nDuring the N64's lifetime, Nintendo made one model revision which made the serial port area smaller. This slight change in the N64's plastic casing made the connection to the Doctor V64 difficult to achieve without user modification. This revision may have been a direct reaction of Nintendo to discourage the use of V64 devices. It also explains why Bung decided to drop the use of this port in the later V64Jr models.\n\nThe Doctor V64 could be used to read the data from a game cartridge and transfer the data to a PC via the parallel port. This allowed developers and homebrew programmers to upload their game images to the Doctor V64 without having to create a CD backup each time. It also allowed users to upload game images taken from the Internet.\n\n== Promotions ==\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, there was a homebrew competition known as \"Presence of Mind\" (POM), an N64 demo competition led by dextrose.com. The contest consisted in submitting a user developed N64 program, game or utility. Bung Enterprises promoted the event and supplied prizes (usually Doctor V64 related accessories). Though a contest was planned for 2000 the interest in the N64 was already fading and so did the event. POM contest demo entries can still be found on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980613235114/http://www.dextrose.com/pom.htm |title=POM - Results |publisher=Dextrose |url=http://www.dextrose.com/pom.htm |archivedate=June 13, 1998 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\n\nThe Doctor V64 unit was the first commercially available backup device for the Nintendo 64 unit. Though the unit was sold as a development machine it could be modified to enable the creation and use of commercial game backups. Unlike official development units, the purchase of V64s was not restricted to software companies only. For this reason the unit became a popular choice among those looking to proliferate unlicensed copies of games.\n\nOriginal Doctor V64 units sold by Bung did not allow the playing of backups. A person would have to modify the unit by themselves in order to make it backup friendly. This usually required a user to download and install a modified Doctor V64 BIOS. Additionally the cartridge adapter had to be opened and soldered in order to allow the operational procedure described early on this article. Though Bung never sold backup enabled V64s many re-sellers would modify the units themselves.\n\nNintendo made many legal efforts worldwide in order to stop the sale of Doctor V64 units.<ref name=\"V64\"/> They sued Bung directly as well as specific store retailers in Europe and North America for copyright infringement. Eventually Nintendo managed to have the courts prohibit the sale of Doctor V64 units in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/122399.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040127/http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/122399.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=December 23, 1999 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=U.S. FEDERAL COURT AWARDS JUDGMENT TO NINTENDO&reg; AGAINST HONG KONG MANUFACTURER OF VIDEO GAME COPIER DEVICES |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/08/45906 |title=Pirates on Game Boy's Bow |publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |author=Benner, Jeffrey |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Main menu ==\n[[File:Dv64-menu c.jpg|thumb|V64 menu screen]]\n\nAs with many backup devices of its time, the Doctor V64 implemented text based menu driven screens. The menus were spartan and purely functional in nature. Utilizing the buttons on the V64 unit a user would navigate the menus and issue commands. It was mainly designed for game developers even though it is possible to backup cartridges with it (through the use of an unofficial V64 bios). Some of the menu items related to game backups were removed from the V64's BIOS near the end of its life due to pressure from Nintendo. These items are only available by obtaining a patched V64 BIOS.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Complete V64 menu listing\n! Menu option\n!

Later bios revisions would do this automatically, deprecating this option.\n|}\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n* CD-ROM access speed: Most early V64 models shipped with a standard [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] 8X CD-ROM . During the manufacturing lifetime of the device, latter V64 models shipped with 16X and eventually 20X drives. V64 units could be purchased without a CD-ROM drive. It is possible to replace the unit with a faster IDE CD-ROM unit (such as the 52X model in the image on this page).\n* Many DrV64s shipped internationally were ordered without an installed CD-ROM drive, to save on shipping costs associated with weight, import duty on the drive and the ever increasing speeds of drives available. While theoretically a benefit in the user being able to use their own faster/cheaper drive, the variance in power draw of different manufacturers drives at different speeds caused issues with discs spin-ups up exceeding the wattage rating of the included Bung PSU. This led to users swapping out the Bung PSU for a more powerful model, or selecting low draw drives (mainly Panasonic drives sometimes badged as Creative).\n* CD-Media: V64s can read CD-Rs and CD-RWs (provided the installed CD-ROM unit supports rewritable media). Supported media has to be recorded in Mode 1, [[ISO 9660]] format. Doctor V64s only supports the [[8.3 filename|8.3 DOS naming convention]]. [[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]] file system is not supported.\n* RAM: 128 megabits (16 MB) or 256 megabits (32 MB). Original V64 units shipped with 128 megabits of RAM. V64 units started shipping with 256 megabits when developers started using bigger sized memory carts for their games. Users of the time had the option of buying a memory upgrade from Bung and other re-sellers.\n* Power supply: The Doctor V64 uses a [[MiniDIN#4-pin|4 Pin MiniDIN]] jack (as used for [[S-Video]]) for connecting the power supply cord. Power supplies included with Doctor V64s were very unreliable. Bung replaced the power supply with a sturdier version in later V64 units. Replacing broken power supplies became one of the most common maintenance problems with the V64. It is possible to modify an [[AT form factor|AT]] PC power supply for V64 use.<ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2016}}[http://www.dextrose-forum.com/_forum/showthread.php?t=10850] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726210604/http://www.dextrose-forum.com/_forum/showthread.php?t=10850 |date=2012-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n== Additional information ==\n\n* The ROM extensions \".v64\" and \".z64\" started out as the preferred naming conventions by Doctor V64 and [[Z64]] users respectively. It would also imply the file's \"endianness\" as those units employed little endian (V64) and big endian (Z64) byte alignment. \".n64\" was used as well but not as much (it became more popular as N64 emulators began to appear).

The crew of two, pilot and navigator, sat side by side. It served during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was one of few operational front-line aircraft of the era whose frame was constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed ''The Wooden Wonder''.<ref>Price 2009, p. 3.</ref> The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the \"Mossie\" to its crews.<ref>Hanson, Dave.

It was also used by the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) as a fast transport to carry small high-value cargoes to, and from, [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral countries]], through [[German-occupied Europe|enemy-controlled airspace]].<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 338.</ref> A single passenger could ride in the aircraft's bomb bay when it was adapted for the purpose.<ref name=Aeroplane0415/>\n\nWhen Mosquito production began in 1941 it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 21.\">Bowman 2005, p. 21.</ref> Entering service in late 1941, the first Mosquito variant was an unarmed high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Subsequent versions continued in this role throughout the war. The first Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. W4064, entered service with No. 105 Squadron on 15 November 1941. From mid-1942 to mid-1943, Mosquito bombers flew high-speed, medium or low-altitude daylight missions against factories, railways and other pinpoint targets in Germany and German-occupied Europe. From June 1943, Mosquito bombers were formed into the [[Pathfinder (RAF)#Light Night Striking Force|Light Night Strike Force]] and used as pathfinders for [[RAF Bomber Command]] heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as \"nuisance\" bombers, often dropping Blockbuster bombs \u2013 [[Blockbuster bomb|{{cvt|4000|lb|kg|sigfig=2}} \"cookies\"]] \u2013 in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.\n\nAs a night fighter from mid-1942, the Mosquito intercepted ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' raids on Britain, notably those of [[Operation Steinbock]] in 1944. Starting in July 1942, Mosquito night-fighter units raided ''Luftwaffe'' airfields. As part of [[100 Group RAF|100 Group]], it was flown as a night fighter and as an intruder supporting Bomber Command heavy bombers that reduced losses during 1944 and 1945.<ref name=\"Has240\">Hastings 1979, p. 240.</ref>{{refn|The Mosquito increased German night-fighter losses to such an extent the Germans were said to have awarded two victories for shooting one down.<ref name=\"Has240\"/>|group=nb}}\n\nThe Mosquito [[fighter-bomber]] served  as a [[attack aircraft|strike aircraft]] in the [[Second Tactical Air Force]] (2TAF) from its inception on 1 Jun 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Overlord - 1944'' - Bracknell Paper No 5 - A Symposium on the Normandy Landings; Royal Air Force Historical Society & Royal Air Force Staff College, Bracknell; 25 March 1994|url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Bracknell-No-5-OVERLORD.pdf|accessdate=1 Apr 2018}}</ref> The main objective was to prepare for the invasion of occupied Europe a year later. In [[Operation Overlord]] three Mosquito FBVI Wings flew close air support for the Allied armies in co-operation with other RAF units equipped with the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] medium bomber. In the months between the foundation of 2TAF and its duties from [[D day]] onwards, vital training was interspersed with attacks on [[V-1 flying bomb]] launch sites.<ref>Birtles 2017, ch. 13.</ref>\n\nThe Mosquito FBVI was often flown in special raids. One of the best-known was [[Operation Jericho]] \u2013 an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944.  Other 2TAF operations included precision attacks against military intelligence, security and police facilities (such as [[Gestapo]] headquarters).\n\nFrom 1943, Mosquitos with [[RAF Coastal Command]] attacked ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[U-boat]]s  and intercepted transport ship concentrations. After [[Operation Overlord]], the U-boat threat in the Western Approaches decreased fairly quickly, but correspondingly the Norwegian and Danish waters posed greater dangers. Hence the RAF Coastal Command Mosquitos were moved to Scotland to counter this threat. The Strike Wing at Banff stood up in September 1944 and comprised Mosquito aircraft of No\u2019s 143, 144, 235 and 248 Squadrons Royal Air Force and No.333 Squadron Royal Norwegian Air Force.\n \nThe Mosquito flew with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and other air forces in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European]], [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] theatres. The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|South East Asian theatre]] and by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) based in [[Maluku Islands|the Halmaheras]] and [[Borneo]] during the [[Pacific War]]. During the 1950s, the RAF replaced the Mosquito with the jet-powered [[English Electric Canberra]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:DH88 Comet G-ACSS Grosvenor House (6741273695).jpg|thumb|Construction concepts pioneered in the de Havilland Comet{{which|date=July 2018}} were later used in the Mosquito.]]\nBy the early-mid-1930s, [[de Havilland]] had a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the [[de Havilland DH.88|DH.88 Comet]] racer. The later [[de Havilland Albatross|DH.91 Albatross]] airliner pioneered the composite wood construction used for the Mosquito. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at {{convert|210|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|11,000|ft|m}}, {{cvt|100|mph|km/h}} faster than the [[Handley Page H.P.42]] and other biplanes it was replacing.<ref>Stroud 1990, p. 369.</ref>{{refn|Part 2 of article is in the July 1990 volume.|group=nb}} The wooden [[monocoque]] construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the [[de Havilland Gipsy Twelve]] engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 9.\">Bowman 2005, p. 9.</ref>\n\n===Air Ministry bomber requirements and concepts===\nOn 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued [[list of Air Ministry specifications|Specification]] P.13/36, which called for a twin-engine medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of {{cvt|3,000|lb|kg}} for {{cvt|3000|mi|km}} with a maximum speed of {{cvt|275|mph|km/h|round=5}} at {{cvt|15000|ft|m}}; a maximum bomb load of {{cvt|8000|lb|kg}} that could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified.<ref name=\"Sharb30\">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.</ref>  Aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]].<ref name=\"Sharb31\">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31.</ref>\n\nIn May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, [[George Volkert]], the chief designer of [[Handley Page]], put forward the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In 20 pages, Volkert planned an aerodynamically clean medium bomber to carry {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of bombs at a cruising speed of {{cvt|300|mph|km/h|round=5}}. There was support in the RAF and Air Ministry; Captain R N Liptrot, Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert's design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the new [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily be faster than enemy fighters for long.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> The ministry was also considering using non-[[strategic]] materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, had led to specification B.9/38 and the [[Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle]] medium bomber, largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. The idea of a small, fast bomber gained support at a much earlier stage than is sometimes acknowledged though it was likely that the Air Ministry envisaged it using light alloy components.<ref>Buttler 2004, pp. 74, 77.</ref>\n\n===Inception of the de Havilland fast bomber===\n[[File:Albatross 1938 prototype.jpg|thumb|One of de Havilland's proposals was to adapt the [[de Havilland Albatross]] design to a fast bomber.]] Based on his experience with the Albatross, [[Geoffrey de Havilland]] believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification.<ref name=\"Birtles 2017, ch. 2\">Birtles 2017, ch. 2.</ref> Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]]-powered DH.91, with the [[Bristol Hercules]] (radial engine) and [[Napier Sabre]] (H-engine) as alternatives.<ref name=\"Sharb30\"/> On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to [[Air Marshal]] [[Wilfrid Freeman]], the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of aluminium and steel but supplies of wood-based products were \"adequate.\" {{refn|Note the use of the word ''\"adequate\"''. A Cypher dated 2 October 1941, cited by Connor <ref name=\"Connor-Madison, pp. 2-3.\"/> reveals that Britain was desperately short: - ''One of four airscrew factories has run out of imported veneers... veneers for air frame plywood would enable... construction to continue till December only... direct contact between Ministry of Supply experts and U.S.A. suppliers of aircraft veneers will be necessary for next three months. Otherwise essential war production... will be further curtailed.'' This sheds a new light on the oft-repeated account that the use of wood avoided reliance on scarce materials. It was valid to claim that a different sector of workforce was engaged. Furthermore at the time, DH's experience was almost exclusively in the use of timber.<ref>Cypher dated 2 October 1941: - To \u2013 British Supply Council in North America. From \u2013 Supply Committee. LONUS 13, National Archives. London.</ref>|group=nb}} Although inferior in [[Tension (physics)|tension]], the [[Specific strength|strength to weight ratio]] of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible.<ref name=\"Birtles 2017, ch. 2\"/><ref name=\"Sharb30\"/>\n\nA follow-up letter to Freeman on 27 July said that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin-powered aircraft and either the top speed or load capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of {{convert|1,500|mi|km}} carrying a 4,000&nbsp;lb bomb load, with a maximum of {{cvt|260|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|19,000|ft|m}}, and a cruising speed of {{convert|230|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|18,000|ft|m}}. De Havilland believed that a compromise, including eliminating surplus equipment, would improve matters.<ref name=\"Sharb30\"/> On 4 October 1938, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the Albatross, powered by two Merlin&nbsp;Xs, with a three-man crew and six or eight forward-firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of {{convert|19,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} it would have a top speed of {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and cruising speed of {{convert|268|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|22,500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Sharb31\" />\n\nStill believing this could be improved, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal [[de Havilland Flamingo|DH.95 Flamingo]], de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development.<ref name=\"Sharb31\"/> The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy [[fighter aircraft]], and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier to evade fighters and ground fire.<ref name=\"Sharb31\"/> The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Whereas contemporary RAF design philosophy favoured well-armed heavy bombers, this mode of design was more akin to the German philosophy of the ''[[schnellbomber]]''.<ref name=\"Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.\">Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.</ref> At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.<ref name=\"Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.\">Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.</ref>\n\nBy September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs.<ref name=\"Buttler, p. 78\">Buttler 2004, p. 78.</ref> One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single {{convert|2,000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}  Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of {{cvt|47|ft|m}} and capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load {{convert|1,500|mi|km}}. On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, de Havilland wrote \"...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.\"<ref name=\"Buttler, p. 78\"/> By 4 October work had progressed to a twin-engine light bomber with a wingspan of {{convert|51|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and powered by Merlin or Griffon engines, the Merlin favoured because of availability.<ref name=\"Buttler, p. 78\"/> On 7 October 1939, a month into the war, the nucleus of a design team under [[Ronald Eric Bishop|Eric Bishop]] moved to the security and secrecy of [[De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre#Salisbury Hall|Salisbury Hall]] to work on what was later known as the DH.98.<ref name=\"Sharb34\">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34.</ref>{{refn|Bishop had worked on the DH.88 Comet and the Albatross under de Havilland's then chief designer A.

It thought the Germans would produce fighters faster than expected.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 31\u201332.</ref> It suggested two forward and two rear-firing machine guns for defence.<ref name=\"Bow0510\">Bowman 2005, p. 10.</ref> The Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at least a third crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 11.\"/> The Air Council added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of {{convert|275|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} at 15,000&nbsp;ft on two-thirds engine power, and a range of {{convert|3,000|mi|km|abbr=on}} with a 4,000&nbsp;lb bomb load.<ref name=\"Bow0510\"/> To appease the Ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 11.\"/>\n\nOn 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]], and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]], Air Marshal Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] and the [[Napier Sabre]]. Although estimates were presented for a slightly larger Griffon-powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, Freeman got the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} at 18,000&nbsp;ft.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 79.</ref>\n\nOn 12 December, the [[Vice-Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Vice-Chief of the Air Staff]], Director General of Research and Development, and the [[Air Officer Commanding|Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (AOC-in-C) of [[RAF Bomber Command]] met to finalise the design and decide how to fit it in the RAF's aims. The AOC-in-C would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted on its suitability for reconnaissance missions with F8 or [[F24 camera]]s.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 12.\">Bowman 2005, p. 12.</ref> After company representatives, the Ministry and the RAF's operational commands examined a full-scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project received backing.<ref name=\"Bu80\">Buttler 2004, p. 80.</ref> This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Freeman chaired a meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly (Buchanan's chief of staff). de Havilland claimed the DH.98 was the \"fastest bomber in the world...it must be useful\". Freeman supported it for RAF service, ordering a single prototype for an unarmed bomber to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two {{convert|1,280|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Rolls-Royce RM3SM (an early designation for the Merlin 21) with [[Meredith effect|ducted radiators]], capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load.<ref name=\"Sharb34\"/><ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 12.\"/> The aircraft was to have a speed of {{cvt|400|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|24,000|ft|m}} and a cruising speed of {{cvt|325|mph|km/h|round=5}} at {{convert|26,500|ft|m}} with a range of {{convert|1,500|mi|km}} at {{convert|25,000|ft|m}} on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be {{convert|32,000|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 12.\"/>\n\nOn 1 March 1940, [[Air Marshal]] [[Roderic Hill]] issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the [[United Kingdom aircraft test serials|factory serial]] ''E0234''.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 35.</ref><ref>Price 2009, p. 51.</ref> In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20&nbsp;mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland was authorised to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after debate that this prototype, given the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|military serial number]] ''W4052'', would carry [[Radar in World War II#Airborne Intercept|Airborne Interception]] (AI) Mk&nbsp;IV equipment as a day and night fighter.{{refn|The term [[radar]], which originated in the USA, was not used by the British until later.|group=nb}} By June 1940, the DH.98 had been named \"Mosquito\".<ref name=\"Bu80\" /> Having the fighter variant kept the Mosquito project alive as there was still criticism within the government and Air Ministry of the usefulness of an unarmed bomber, even after the prototype had shown its capabilities.<ref name=\"Bu80\"/>\n\n===Project Mosquito===\n[[File:DE HAVILLAND 1943 Advertisement s.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 1943 advertisement for de Havilland taken from ''[[Flight International|Flight & Aircraft Engineer]]'' magazine highlights the speed of the B Mk IV.]]\nWith design of the DH.98 started, mock-ups were built, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, where ''E0234'' was later constructed. Initially, the concept was for the crew to be enclosed in the fuselage behind a [[stepless cockpit|transparent nose]] (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or [[Heinkel He 111]]H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a conventional canopy.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], when [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1942.\n\nBeaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project should stop, but he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 37.</ref> In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production should focus on five existing types, namely the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter, [[Vickers Wellington]], [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]], and [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 12.\" /> Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped. Apparently the project shut down when the design team were denied materials for the prototype.<ref name=\"Jackson 2003, p. 7.\">Jackson 2003, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland's general manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitos by December 1941. This was only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland's primary work of producing [[Tiger Moth]] and [[Airspeed Oxford]] trainers, repairing [[Hawker Hurricanes|Hurricanes]] and manufacturing Merlin engines under licence.<ref name=\"Jackson 2003, p. 7.\"/> In promising Beaverbrook such a number by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that they could be built in such a limited time. As it transpired, only 20 aircraft were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 35\u201336, 82.</ref> During the [[Battle of Britain]], interruptions to production due to air raid warnings caused nearly a third of de Havilland's factory time to be lost.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 38.</ref> Nevertheless, work on the prototype went ahead quickly at Salisbury Hall since ''E0234'' was completed by November 1940.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: ''W4052'', ''W4053'' and ''W4073''. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 178.</ref> This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|perspex]] bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid nose housing four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.<ref name=\"Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.\"/>\n\n===Prototypes and test flights===\nOn 3 November 1940, the aircraft, painted in \"prototype yellow\" and still coded ''E0234'', was disassembled and transported by road to [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed, driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic [[Controllable pitch propeller|constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers]]. Successful engine runs were made on 19 November.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 18.\"/> On 24 November, successful taxiing trials were carried out by [[Geoffrey de Havilland Jr.]], who was the company's chief [[test pilot]]. Then on 25 November, the prototype made its first flight, piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., accompanied by John E. Walker, the chief engine installation designer. {{refn|This first flight was made only 11 months after the start of detailed design work.<ref name=\"Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6.\" />|group=nb}}\n\nFor this maiden flight, ''E0234'', weighing {{convert|14150|lb|kg}}, took off from the grass airstrip at the Hatfield site. The takeoff was reported as \"straightforward and easy\" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was attained.<ref name=\"Thir25\">Thirsk 2006, p. 25.</ref> The aircraft reached {{cvt|220|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}, with the only problem being the undercarriage doors \u2013 which were operated by [[bungee cord]]s attached to the main undercarriage legs \u2013 that remained open by some {{convert|12|in|mm}} at that speed.<ref name=\"Thir25\"/> This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of ''E0234'' also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a [[Bracing (aeronautics)|rigging]] adjustment, i.e., a slight change in the angle of the wing, was carried out before further flights.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 18.\">Bowman 2005, p. 18.</ref>{{refn|''E0234'' had a wingspan of {{convert|52|ft|2|in|abbr=on}} and was the only Mosquito to be built with [[Handley Page]] [[Leading edge slats|slats]] on the outer leading edges of the wings.

The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from the rear section of the inner engine [[nacelle]]s was disturbed, leading to a localised [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from forcefully striking the tailplane, non-retractable [[Leading edge slot|slots]] fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane were experimented with.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 27\u201329.</ref> These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced but did not cure the tailplane buffeting.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} behind the wing's trailing edge: this meant the [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 19.\">Bowman 2005, p. 19.</ref>{{refn|On ''W4050'' the nacelle extensions were not as long as those fitted to production Mosquitoes: nacelles of the definitive shape and length were first fitted to the fighter prototype ''W4052''.

He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it might completely replace the [[Bristol Beaufighter]] in the night fighter role.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 19.\"/>\n\nDuring its trials on 16 January 1941, ''W4050'' outpaced a Spitfire at {{convert|6000|ft|abbr=on}}. The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mk II]], but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being {{cvt|20|mph|km/h|round=5}} faster. Over the next few months, ''W4050'' surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at [[RAF Boscombe Down]] in February 1941, reaching a top speed of {{cvt|392|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|22000|ft|m}} altitude, compared to a top speed of {{cvt|360|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|19500|ft|m}} for the Spitfire.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 8.\"/>\n\nOn 19 February, official trials began at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&AEE)  based at [[MoD Boscombe Down|Boscombe Down]], although de Havilland's representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests.<ref name=\"Sharb445\">Sharp and Bowyer 1971, pp. 44\u201345.</ref> On 24 February, as ''W4050'' taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing. Repairs were made by early March, using part of the fuselage of the photo-reconnaissance prototype ''W4051''.{{refn|This accident occurred because the tailwheel unit was unable to [[caster]] properly, a problem solved in June\u2013July 1941 by fitting a [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] unit.|group=nb}} In spite of this setback, the ''Initial Handling Report 767'' issued by the A&AEE stated \"The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... aileron control light and effective ...\" The maximum speed reached was {{cvt|388|mph|abbr=on}} at {{convert|22,000|ft|abbr=on}}, with an estimated maximum ceiling of {{convert|34000|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum rate of climb of {{convert|2,880|ft/min|abbr=on}} at {{convert|11500|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Sharb445\" />\n\n''W4050'' continued to be used for various test programmes, essentially as the experimental \"workhorse\" for the Mosquito family.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> In late October 1941, it returned to the factory to be fitted with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin 61s]], the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger.

In September 1958, ''W4050'' was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar where it was built, restored to its original configuration, and became one of the primary exhibits of the [[de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre]].<ref>Thirsk 2006, 36\u201338.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXNXGGNRws&feature=related Time-lapse footage of restoration work on ''W4050'', 9 January 2011.] Retrieved: 3 January 2012.</ref>\n[[File:De Havilland Mosquito - Prototype 1.jpg|thumb|''W4050'' being restored at the [[de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre]] near St Albans.]]\n''W4051'', which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in ''W4050'' meant that ''W4051's'' fuselage was used as a replacement; ''W4051'' was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the {{convert|19|ft|5.5|in|abbr=on}} \"No. 1\"  tailplane used by ''W4050'', but had production standard {{convert|54|ft|2|in|abbr=on}} wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally.<ref name=\"Thirsk 2006, p. 269\">Thirsk 2006, p. 269.</ref>\n\nConstruction of the fighter prototype, ''W4052'' was also carried out at the secret [[De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre#Salisbury Hall|Salisbury Hall]] facility. This differed from its bomber brethren in a number of ways: it was powered by {{convert|1460|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Merlin&nbsp;21s; had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen; a solid nose mounted four .303 British [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] and their ammunition boxes, accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.;<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 125.</ref> four 20&nbsp;mm [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano&nbsp;Mk II]] cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay; and the automatic bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors, which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes.<ref name=\"Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134\">Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with its role as a day and night fighter prototype ''W4052'' was equipped with AI Mk&nbsp;IV equipment, complete with an \"arrowhead\"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a \"Special Night\" finish.<ref>Thirsk 2006, pp. 124\u2013127.</ref>{{refn|The RDM2a finish was notoriously rough and it was hard to maintain: tests later proved that it could cut the top speed of a Mosquito by up to {{cvt|26|mph|abbr=on}} and, by March 1942 was replaced by the black \"Night Type S\" (Night Type Smooth) finish.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 134.</ref>|group=nb}} It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles.<ref>Thirsk 2006, p. 126.</ref> ''W4052'' was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, [[barrage balloon]] cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems that enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab.\n\nThe prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 21.\" />\n\n''4055'' flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 20.\" />\n\nDuring flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. ''W4050'' was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. ''W4052'' had the first version of the [[Fairey Aviation Company|Youngman Frill]] airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was mounted around the fuselage behind the wing and was opened by bellows and [[venturi effect]] to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January \u2013 August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 20.\"/>\n<!--- Something is missing here--- It was used to eliminate problems on ''W4052''.

A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, it was confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 21.\"/>   By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by [[de Havilland Canada]].<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 24.\">Bowman 2005, p. 24.</ref>\n\nOn 20 April 1941, ''W4050'' was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General [[Henry H. Arnold]] and his aide [[Major]] [[Elwood Quesada]], who wrote \"I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.\"<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 19.\"/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7pNBSRkEiQ&feature=related \"WWII US Film on Mosquito.\"] ''youtube.com.'' Retrieved: 3 January 2012.</ref>\n\nThe trials set up future production plans between Britain, [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]. Six days later Arnold returned to America with a full set of manufacturer's drawings. As a result of his report five companies (Beech; [[Curtiss-Wright]]; [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]]; Fleetwings; and Hughes) were asked to evaluate the de Havilland data. The report by Beech Aircraft summed up the general view: \"It appears as though this airplane has sacrificed serviceability, structural strength, ease of construction and flying characteristics in an attempt to use construction material which is not suitable for the manufacture of efficient airplanes.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mosquito the Original Multi Role Aircraft|last=Simons|first=Graham M.|publisher=Pen & Sword Aviation|year=2011|isbn=9781844682607|location=|pages=}}</ref> The Americans did not pursue the proposal for licensed production, the consensus arguing that the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] could fulfill the same duties. However, Arnold urged the [[USAAF|United States Army Air Forces]] to evaluate the design even if they would not adopt it. On 12 December 1941, after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the USAAF requested one airframe for this purpose.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 20.\">Bowman 2005, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Design and manufacture==\n===Overview===\n[[File:MossyCloseup42.jpg|thumb|B Mk IV nose closeup showing bombsight and clear nose, plus engine nacelles and undercarriage.]]\nWhile timber construction was considered outmoded by some, de Havilland claimed that their successes with techniques used for the DH 91 Albatross could lead to a fast light bomber using monocoque sandwich shell construction.<ref>Birtles 2017, chs. 2, 3.</ref> Arguments in favor of this included speed of prototyping, rapid development, minimisation of jig building time, and employment of a separate category of workforce. At the same time, they had to fight conservative Air Ministry views on defensive armament. Guns and gun turrets would spoil the streamlining, losing speed and manoeuvrability. The ply-balsa-ply monocoque fuselage and one-piece wings with doped fabric covering gave smooth aerodynamic performance and low weight, combined with strength and stiffness. Whilst submitting these arguments, Geoffrey de Havilland funded his private venture until the eleventh hour. It was a success beyond all expectations. The initial bomber and photo reconnaissance versions were extremely fast, whilst the armament of subsequent variants might be regarded as primarily offensive.\n\nThe most-produced variant, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers.<!---Both propellers and airscrews have been used, consolidate on one term.---> The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20&nbsp;mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to {{convert|2000|lb|kg}} of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.<ref>Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 17.</ref>\n\n===Performance===\nThe design was noted for light and effective control surfaces that provided good manoeuvrability but required that the rudder not be used aggressively at high speeds. Poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, pp. 28\u201329. (FB 6 notes)</ref> For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15\u00b0, speed reduced to {{cvt|200|mph|km/h}} and [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable {{cvt|150|mph|km/h}} for low speed flying.<ref name=\"Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)\"/> For cruising, the optimum speed for obtaining maximum range was {{cvt|200|mph|km/h}} at {{convert|17000|lb|abbr=on}} weight.<ref name=\"Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)\"/>\n\nThe Mosquito had a low stalling speed of {{cvt|120|mph|km/h}} with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stalling speed decreased from {{cvt|120|to|100|mph|km/h}}. Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was {{cvt|100|to|110|mph|km/h}}. Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur {{cvt|12|mph|km/h}} before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.<ref name=\"Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes)\">Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).</ref>\n\nEarly on in the Mosquito's operational life, the intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by {{cvt|10|to|13|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 21.\"/>\n\n===Fuselage===\nThe oval-section fuselage was a frameless [[monocoque]] shell built in two vertically-separate halves formed over a [[mahogany]] or [[concrete]] mould.{{refn| Both types of mould were used, at certain times and in different factories. |group=nb}} Pressure was applied with [[band clamp]]s. The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply outers, with cores of Ecuadorean [[balsa]].{{refn| This was specially graded for density to a mean of 9 lb. per cu. ft., since this species is highly variable and the cores comprised a significant proportion of the total weight. |group=nb}} In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core.

It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.\n\nSpruce and plywood ribs were connected with gusset joints. Some heavy-duty ribs contained pieces of ash and walnut as well as the special five ply that included veneers laid up at 45 degrees.

The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to \"lift\" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major [[Hereward de Havilland]] travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that \"the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season\".  {{refn|Many sources repeat the account of the change from casein adhesive to urea formaldehyde adhesive. These nearly always fail to recognise that both types, in the form used, were close-assembly adhesives, employed to bond the air-frame components together, often using the technique of \"screw-gluing\". Plywood manufacture, on the other hand, used \"WBP- water and boil-proof\" (obsolescent BSI term), or ASTM equivalent, right from the start. Most of the adhesives failures in the tropics were due to water penetration into the interior cavities and balsa cores, with consequent swelling-shrinkage cycling. There were warnings, probably ignored in \"the exigencies\" that aircraft should never be parked permanently in the open. DH had always recognised that casein assembly adhesive was unsuitable for Mosquitos entering Far East service. Bonding additional cover strips over some of the major joints e.g. wing leading edges to main spars, was a stop-gap measure taken by DH Australia.<ref>Federal Aviation Administration, Advisory Circular AC 43.13-1B. \"Acceptable Methods, Techniques, And Practices - Aircraft  Inspection And Repair\" 1998; Chapter 1 - Wood Structure\" Page 1-4, states: Phenol-formaldehyde adhesive is commonly used in the manufacturing of aircraft grade plywood. This product is cured at elevated temperature and pressure.</ref>|group = nb}} However, a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at [[RAF Defford|Defford]], which found faults in six Mosquito marks (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants). The defects were similar, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack.\n\nThe investigators concluded that there were construction defects at the two plants.

On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs.<ref name=\"Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134\"/> The type was also fitted with a [[gun camera]] in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Britain experienced day-time incursions of the high-altitude reconnaissance bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 86|Junkers Ju 86P]].<ref name=\"Birtles 2017, ch. 6\">Birtles 2017, ch. 6.</ref> Although the Ju 86P only carried a light bomb load, it overflew sensitive areas, including Bristol, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Bombs were dropped on Luton and elsewhere, and this particular aircraft was seen from the main de Havilland offices and factory at Hatfield. An attempt to intercept it with a Spitfire from RAF Manston was unsuccessful. As a result of the potential threat, a decision was quickly taken to develop a high-altitude Mosquito interceptor, using the ''MP469'' prototype.\n\n''MP469'' entered the experimental shop on the 7 September and made its initial flight on the 14 September, piloted by John de Havilland. The bomber nose was altered using a normal fighter nose, armed with four standard [[.303 British|.303 (7.7 mm)]] [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. The low pressure cabin retained a bomber canopy structure and a two-piece windscreen. The control wheel was replaced with a fighter control stick. The wingspan was increased to {{convert|59|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The airframe was lightened by removing armour plating, some fuel tanks and other fitments. Smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of {{convert|16,200|lb|abbr=on}} this HA Mk XV was {{convert|2,300|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than a standard Mk II. For this first conversion, the engines were a pair of Merlin 61s. On 15 September, John de Havilland reached an altitude of {{convert|43,000|ft|m}} in this version. The aircraft was delivered to a High Altitude Flight which had been formed at RAF Northolt. However, the high-level German daylight intruders were no longer to be seen. It was subsequently revealed that only five Ju 86P aircraft had been built and they had only flown 12 sorties. Nevertheless, the general need for high altitude interceptors was recognised - but now the emphasis was to be upon night fighters.\n\nThe A&AEE tested the climb and speed of night fighter conversion of MP469 in January 1943 for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.<ref>Aircraft And Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, Mosquito NF MkXV MP469, Short performance and handling trials, January 1943; Online PDF, Courtesy of Neil Stirling\n[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mosquito/mp469.pdf, accessed 14 Aug 2017]</ref> Wingspan had been increased to {{convert|62|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the Brownings had been moved to a fairing below the fuselage. According to Birtles, an AI radar was mounted in the nose and the Merlins were upgraded to Mk76 type, although Boscombe Down reported Merlin 61s.

However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company's design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito, when fitted with a turret would be considered for the night fighter requirement.<ref>Buttler pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\nThe first production [[night fighter]] Mosquitos - minus turrets - were designated '''NF Mk II'''.

However, from 10,000 to {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} the maximum speed was 348 knots (400&nbsp;mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} 320 knots (368&nbsp;mph); 20,000 to {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 295 knots (339&nbsp;mph); 25,000 to {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 260 knots (299&nbsp;mph); 30,000 to {{convert|35000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 235 knots (270&nbsp;mph). With two added 100-gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379&nbsp;mph); between 15,000 and {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} 320 knots (368&nbsp;mph); 20,000 to {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 295 knots (339&nbsp;mph); 25,000 to {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 260 knots (299&nbsp;mph); 30,000 to {{convert|35000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 235 knots (270&nbsp;mph).

For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of [[No. 143 Squadron RAF|143 Squadron]] were engaged by 30 [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s from ''[[Jagdgeschwader 5]]'': the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, but five Mosquitos were lost (two reportedly to flak),<ref>Bird 2003, pp. 94 \u2013 98.</ref> while shooting down five Fw 190s.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 112.</ref> \nHowever, the loss of a two-seat, twin engine aircraft like the Mosquito represented a more costly loss than a single-seat, single-engine fighter (like the Fw&nbsp;190). The loss of two Mosquitos to flak also underlined the vulnerability of the type to AA artillery \u2013 a flaw that contributed to the [[Bristol Beaufighter]] constituting the backbone of Commonwealth strike and ground attack squadrons around the world, until the end of the war.\n\n[[File:613 Squadron Mosquito FB.VI at RAF Lasham June 1944.jpg|left|thumb|An FB Mk VI ''NS898'' of [[No. 613 Squadron RAF|613 Squadron]], June 1944, shows full [[invasion stripes]] and is well weathered through operational use.]]\n\nAnother fighter-bomber variant was the '''Mosquito FB Mk XVIII''' (sometimes known as the ''[[Tsetse fly|Tsetse]]'') of which one was converted from a FB Mk VI to serve as prototype and 17 were purpose-built. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins \"6-pounder Class M\" cannon: this was a modified [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder (57&nbsp;mm) anti-tank gun]] fitted with an [[auto-loader]] to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire.{{refn|\"Molins\" refers specifically to the auto-loading mechanism produced by the Molins company.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/>|group=nb}} 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing {{convert|1580|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/>  In addition, {{convert|900|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from heavily armed U-boats, the intended primary target of the Mk XVIII.<ref>Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 271.</ref> Two or four .303 (7.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to \"sight\" the main weapon onto the target.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/>\n\nThe [[Air Ministry]] initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making its wooden construction an even greater liability, in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2950|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/> and an excellent range of some {{convert|1,800|\u2013|1,500|yds|m|abbr=off}}. It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} at a 30\u00b0 angle with the [[turn and bank indicator]] on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun.<ref>Bowman 2005, p. 105.</ref> The prototype ''HJ732'' was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/>\n\nThe effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from [[No. 248 Squadron RAF|248 Squadron]] (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88s]]. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged.

Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.\n\nDesigns based on the Mk VI were the '''FB Mk 26''', built in Canada, and the '''FB Mk 40''', built in Australia, powered by [[Packard V-1650|Packard Merlins]]. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using {{convert|1620|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 165.\"/> 212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s, one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43 trainers. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.<ref name=\"Bowman 2005, p. 166.\"/>\n\n===Trainers===\nThe Mosquito was also built as the '''Mosquito T Mk III''' two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the '''T Mk III''' were built for the RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]]. [[de Havilland Australia]] built 11 '''T Mk 43''' trainers, similar to the Mk III.\n\n===Torpedo-bombers===\nTo meet specification [[N.15/44]] for a navalised Mosquito for [[Royal Navy]] use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a [[aircraft carrier|carrier-borne]] variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated '''Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33''' with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric \"Winkle\" Brown]] aboard [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']], the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20&nbsp;mm cannon, two 500&nbsp;lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60&nbsp;lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six '''Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37'''s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33's AN/APS-6.\n\n===Target tugs===\n\nThe RAF's target tug version was the '''Mosquito TT Mk 35''', which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service with No 3 CAACU at Exeter, being finally retired in 1963. These aircraft were then featured in the film [[633 Squadron]].\nA number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The Royal Navy also operated the '''Mosquito TT Mk 39''' for target towing.\nTwo ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at [[Manchester Airport|Manchester (Ringway) Airport]] by [[Fairey Aviation]] in 1953\u20131954, and delivered to the [[Belgian Air Force]] for use as towing aircraft from the [[Sylt]] firing ranges.\n\n===Canadian-built===\n[[File:DeHavilland Mosquito NACA 1945.jpg|thumb|B Mk XX, the Canadian version of B Mk IV.

After his adoptive mother's death when he was 5, his father moved around the country seeking work. Thomas spent some of his early childhood near [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] with his grandmother, Minnie Sinclair, whom he credited with teaching him the importance of service and treating others well and with respect, lessons that helped him in his future business life.<ref>Thomas, R.

He vowed never to lose another job. Moving with his father, by 15 he was working in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] at the Hobby House Restaurant owned by the Clauss family. When his father prepared to move again, Thomas decided to stay in Fort Wayne, dropping out of high school to work full-time at the restaurant. Thomas, who considered ending his schooling the greatest mistake of his life, did not graduate from high school until 1993, when he obtained a [[General Educational Development|GED]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/01/08/thomas_020108.html|title=Wendy's founder Dave Thomas dead at 69|date=January 8, 2002 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211191804/http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/01/08/thomas_020108.html |archivedate=February 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe subsequently became an education advocate and founded the Dave Thomas Education Center in [[Coconut Creek, Florida]], which offers GED classes to young adults.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/wendys-founder-dave-thomas-was-a-high-school-dropout-2013-6 |title=The Founder Of Wendy's Got His GED Because He Didn't Want To Be A Dropout Success Story |last=Giang |first=Vivian |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/b/104288341123124394353/104288341123124394353/about/ |title=Dave Thomas East Education Center GED ENGLISH CLASSES - Google |publisher=Plus.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===U.S. Army===\nAt the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, rather than waiting for [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], he volunteered for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to have some choice in assignments. Having food production and service experience, Thomas requested the [[Quartermaster Center and School|Cook's and Baker's School]] at [[Fort Benning|Fort Benning, Georgia]]. He was sent to West Germany as a mess sergeant and was responsible for the daily meals of 2,000 soldiers, rising to the rank of [[staff sergeant#United States|staff sergeant]]. After his discharge in 1953, Thomas returned to Fort Wayne and the Hobby House.\n\n===Fast food career===\n====Kentucky Fried Chicken====\nIn the mid-1950s, Kentucky Fried Chicken founder [[Colonel Sanders|Col. Harland Sanders]] came to Fort Wayne to find restaurateurs with established businesses in order to try to sell KFC franchises to them. At first, Thomas, who was the head cook at a restaurant, and the Clausses declined Sanders' offer, but Sanders persisted and the Clauss family franchised their restaurant with KFC and later also owned many other KFC franchises in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. During this time, Thomas worked with Sanders on many projects to make KFC more profitable and to give it brand recognition. Among other things Thomas suggested to Sanders, that were implemented, was that KFC reduce the number of items on the menu and focus on a signature dish. Thomas also suggested Sanders make commercials that he appear in himself. Thomas was sent by the Clauss family in the mid-1960s to help turn around four failing KFC stores they owned in [[Columbus, Ohio]].{{fact|date=February 2016}}\n\nBy 1968 Thomas had increased sales in the four [[fried chicken restaurant]]s so much that he sold his share in them back to Sanders for more than $1.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-02290.html |title=Thomas, Dave |author=Dennis Wepman |website=[[American National Biography]] |access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> This experience would prove invaluable to Thomas when he began Wendy's about a year later.\n\n====Arthur Treacher's====\nAfter serving as a regional director for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Thomas became part of the investor group which founded [[Arthur Treacher's]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/business/dave-thomas-69-wendy-s-founder-dies.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Dave Thomas, 69, Wendy's Founder, Dies | date=January 9, 2002 | first1=Douglas | last1=Martin}}</ref> His involvement with the new restaurant lasted less than a year before he went on to found Wendy's.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-24/features/9102180579_1_real-hamburger-square-patties-kentucky-fried-chicken | work=Sun-Sentinel | title= Wendy's Dad Short-order Cook Dave Thomas Set Out To Build A Better Burger.

According to ''Bio TV'', Dave claims himself that people nicknamed his daughter \"Wenda. Not Wendy, but Wenda. 'I'm going to call it Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers'.\"<ref name=\"BIOCNBC\">{{cite episode|title=Dave Thomas: Made to Order|series=Biography on CNBC|season=1|number=8|airdate=2009-12-17|network=CNBC}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Thomas resigned from his day-to-day operations at Wendy's. However, by 1985, several company business decisions, including an awkward new breakfast menu and loss in brand awareness due to fizzled marketing efforts, caused the company's new president to urge Thomas back into a more active role with Wendy's. Thomas began to visit franchises and espouse his hardworking, so-called \"mop-bucket attitude.\" In 1989, he took on a significant role as the TV spokesperson in a series of commercials for the brand. Thomas was not a natural actor, and initially, his performances were criticized as stiff and ineffective by advertising critics.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Foltz, Kim, ''The Media Business: Advertising; At Wendy's, Folksiness Is Effective'', The New York Times, August 22, 1990</ref>\n\nBy 1990, after efforts by Wendy's agency, Backer Spielvolgel Bates, to get humor into the campaign, a decision was made to portray Thomas in a more self-deprecating and folksy manner, which proved much more popular with test audiences.<ref>Foltz, Kim, ''The Media Business: Advertising; At Wendy's, Folksiness Is Effective'', August 22, 1990</ref> Consumer brand awareness of Wendy's eventually regained levels it had not achieved since octogenarian [[Clara Peller]]'s wildly popular \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" campaign of 1984.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWith his natural self-effacing style and his relaxed manner, Thomas quickly became a household name. A company survey during the 1990s, a decade during which Thomas starred in every Wendy's commercial that aired, found that 90% of Americans knew who Thomas was. After more than 800 commercials,<ref name=bio/> it was clear that Thomas played a major role in Wendy's status as the country's third most popular burger restaurant.\n\nIn 1994, Thomas made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in ''[[Bionic Ever After?]]'', a reunion TV movie based upon ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nDave Thomas was married for 47 years to Lorraine. She is the mother of their five children. In addition to Melinda they had three more daughters, Pam, Lori and Molly, and a son, Kenny. Though Kenny died in 2013, Dave's daughters still continue to own and run multiple Wendy's locations.  Thomas founded the chain Sisters Chicken and Biscuits in 1978, named in reference to his other 3 daughters.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Start Byline--><!--End Byline--> |url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/08/companies/wendys_obit/ |title=Wendy's founder Dave Thomas dead at 100Jan. 8, 2002 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2017-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Honors and memberships==\nThomas, realizing that his success as a high school dropout might convince other teenagers to quit school (something he later claimed was a mistake), became a student at [[Coconut Creek High School]].

When a calling program invokes a [[subroutine|routine]] in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and [[operating system|operating-system]]-specific. They usually provide the [[interrupt]] handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCCfRAj3aCgC&dq=device+driver+hardware+dependent&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Information Storage and Management: Storing, Managing, and Protecting Digital Information|year=2010|author=EMC Education Services|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or [[operating system]]s that use it.<ref name=\"dev1\"/>  Programmers can write the higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.\n\nFor example, a high-level application for interacting with a [[serial port]] may simply have two functions for \"send data\" and \"receive data\". At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a user's computer. The commands needed to control a [[16550 UART]] are much different from the commands needed to control an [[FTDI]] serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstracts]] these details into the same (or similar) software interface.\n\n==Development==\nWriting a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given [[Computing platform|platform]] function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly [[privilege (computing)|privilege]]d environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern [[operating system]]s can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in [[user mode]] can crash a system if the device is erroneously programmed. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aFQAAAAMAAJ&q=writing+a+device+driver&dq=writing+a+device+driver&hl=fil&sa=X&ei=yA2jUJyXEKmfiAes44CIAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ|title=Writing device drivers: tutorial and reference|year=1995|author=Burke, Timothy|publisher=Digital Press}}</ref>\n\nThe task of writing drivers thus usually falls to [[software engineer]]s or [[computer engineer]]s who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware [[manufacturer]]'s interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimum way. Typically, the [[Logical Device Driver]] (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the [[Physical Device Driver]] (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. But in recent years non-vendors have written numerous device drivers, mainly for use with [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]]s. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provides information on how the device communicates.  Although this information can instead be learned by [[reverse engineering]], this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.\n\n[[Microsoft]] has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF).  This includes [[User-Mode Driver Framework]] (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers\u2014primarily those that implement a [[message-based protocol]] for communicating with their devices\u2014as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The [[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework]] (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers, but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug and play device support.\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has an open-source framework for developing drivers on [[macOS]] called the [[I/O&nbsp;Kit]].\n\nIn [[Linux kernel|Linux]] environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the [[Linux kernel|kernel]], separately as loadable [[loadable kernel module|module]]s, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). [[Makedev]] includes a list of the devices in Linux: ttyS (terminal), lp ([[parallel port]]), hd (disk), loop, sound  (these include [[Sound card mixer|mixer]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], [[Digital signal processor|dsp]], and audio)...<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_MAKEDEV.htm\n | title = MAKEDEV&nbsp;\u2014 Linux Command&nbsp;\u2014 Unix Command\n | publisher = Linux.about.com\n | date = 2009-09-11\n | accessdate = 2009-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows]] [[.sys]] files and [[Linux]] .ko modules contain loadable device drivers. The advantage of loadable device drivers is that they can be loaded only when necessary and then unloaded, thus saving kernel memory.\n\n==Kernel mode vs. user mode==\nDevice drivers, particularly on {{as of | 2009 | alt = modern}} [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, can run in [[CPU modes|kernel-mode]] ([[Ring (computer security)|Ring 0 on x86 CPUs]]) or in [[user space|user-mode]] (Ring&nbsp;3 on x86 CPUs).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/eb1936c0-e19c-4a17-a1a8-39292e4929a41033.mspx?mfr=true\n | title = User-mode vs. Kernel-mode Drivers\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | date = 2003-03-01\n | accessdate = 2008-03-04\n}}</ref> The primary benefit of running a driver in user mode is improved stability, since a poorly written user mode device driver cannot crash the system by overwriting kernel memory.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/iliast/archive/2006/10/10/Introduction-to-the-User_2D00_Mode-Driver-Framework.aspx\n | title = Introduction to the User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF)\n | date = 2006-10-10\n | accessdate = 2008-03-04\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref> On the other hand, user/kernel-mode transitions usually impose a considerable performance overhead, thereby prohibiting user-mode drivers for low latency and high throughput requirements.\n\nKernel space can be accessed by user module only through the use of system calls. End user programs like the UNIX  shell or other GUI-based applications are part of the user space. These applications interact with hardware through kernel supported functions.\n\n==Applications==\nBecause of the diversity of {{as of | 2009 | alt = modern}} hardware and operating systems, drivers operate in many different environments.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfU7RtI7OX8C&dq=applications+device+driver&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Understanding Computers 2009: Today and Tomorrow|year=2009|author=Deborah Morley|publisher=Cengage Learning}}</ref> Drivers may [[interface (computer science)|interface]] with:\n\n* [[Computer printer|Printers]]\n* [[Video card|Video adapters]]\n* [[Network interface controller|Network cards]]\n* [[Sound card]]s\n* Local [[Computer bus|buses]] of various sorts\u2014in particular, for [[bus mastering]] on modern systems\n* Low-[[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] [[input/output|I/O]] buses of various sorts (for [[pointing device]]s such as [[Computer mouse|mice]], [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], etc.)\n* [[Computer storage]] devices such as [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[floppy disk]] buses ([[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]], [[Serial ATA|SATA]], [[SCSI]])\n* Implementing support for different [[file system]]s\n* [[Image scanner]]s\n* [[Digital camera]]s\n\nCommon levels of abstraction for device drivers include:\n* For hardware:\n** Interfacing directly\n** Writing to or reading from a [[device control register]]\n** Using some higher-level interface (e.g. [[Video BIOS]])\n** Using another lower-level device driver (e.g. file system drivers using disk drivers)\n** Simulating work with hardware, while doing something entirely different<ref name=\"Computer Peripherals and Interfaces\">{{cite book|title=Computer Peripherals and Interfaces|date=January 2008|publisher=Technical Publications Pune|isbn=8184314744|pages=5\u20138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uK01xKT_mAMC&pg=SA5-PA8&lpg=SA5-PA8&dq=Simulating+work+with+hardware,+while+doing+something+entirely+different&source=bl&ots=tFgCB2iFaQ&sig=G4YPK6LI2KrIT7MN6IoDKt4THOk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhpOnBxMDMAhXHvBQKHYYMAwEQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=Simulating%20work%20with%20hardware%2C%20while%20doing%20something%20entirely%20different&f=false|accessdate=2016-05-03|ref=CPIbook}}</ref>\n* For software:\n** Allowing the operating system direct access to hardware resources\n** Implementing only [[primitive (computer science)|primitive]]s\n** Implementing an interface for non-driver software (e.g. [[TWAIN]])\n** Implementing a language, sometimes quite high-level (e.g. [[PostScript]])\n\nSo choosing and installing the correct device drivers for given hardware is often a key component of computer system configuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drivers.com/update/drivers-news/what-are-device-drivers-and-why-do-we-need-them/|title=What are Device Drivers and why do we need them?|date=April 17, 2015|access-date=March 19, 2018|website=drivers.com}}</ref>\n\n==Virtual device drivers==\nVirtual device drivers represent a particular variant of device drivers. They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in [[virtual machine|virtualization]] environments, for example when a [[DOS]] program is run on a [[Microsoft Windows]] computer or when a guest [[operating system]] is run on, for example, a [[Xen]] host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a [[virtual machine]] can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g.,&nbsp;[[function call]]s. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like [[interrupt]]s into the virtual machine.\n\nVirtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual [[Network interface controller|network adapter]] is used with a [[virtual private network]], while a virtual [[Hard disk drive|disk]] device is used with [[iSCSI]]. A good example for virtual device drivers can be [[Daemon Tools]].\n\nThere are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as [[VxD]]s, [[VLM (NetWare)|VLM]]s, and VDDs.\n\n==Open drivers==\n* Printers: [[CUPS]]\n* RAIDs: CCISS<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://sourceforge.net/projects/cciss/\n| title       = CCISS\n| year        = 2010\n| work        = [[SourceForge]]\n| accessdate  = 2010-08-11\n| quote       = Drivers for the HP (previously Compaq) Smart Array controllers which provide hardware RAID capability.\n}}\n</ref> (Compaq Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url         = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246852.pd\n|title       = Abbreviations and acronyms\n|first       = Steve\n|last        = Russell\n|date        = 2003-10-21\n|work        = Server Consolidation with the IBM eserver xSeries 440 and VMware ESX Serve\n|publisher   = IBM International Technical Support Organization\n|page        = 207\n|isbn        = 0-7384-2684-9\n|accessdate  = 2011-08-14\n|display-authors=etal}}\n</ref>)\n* Scanners: [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]\n* Video: [[Vidix]], [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n\n[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] descriptions of commonly used device drivers:\n* fas: Fast/wide SCSI controller\n* hme: Fast (10/100 Mbit/s) Ethernet\n* isp: Differential SCSI controllers and the SunSwift card\n* glm: (Gigabaud Link Module<ref>{{cite web\n | title = US Patent 5969841 - Gigabaud link module with received power detect signal\n | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | publisher = PatentStorm LLC\n | accessdate = 2009-09-08\n | quote = An improved Gigabaud Link Module (GLM) is provided for performing bi-directional data transfers between a host device and a serial transfer medium.\n}}</ref>) UltraSCSI controllers\n* scsi: Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) devices\n* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)\n* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device\n* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)\n\n==APIs==\n* [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) \u2013 the graphic display driver architecture for [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], and [[Windows 10]].\n* Unified Audio Model (UAM)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms894071.aspx|title=Unified Audio Model (Windows CE 5.0)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF)\n* [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM)\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) \u2013 a standard [[network card]] driver API\n* [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture]] (ALSA) \u2013 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} the standard Linux sound-driver interface\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE) \u2013 a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware\n* [[I/O Kit]] \u2013 an open-source framework from [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for developing [[macOS]] device drivers\n* [[Installable File System]] (IFS) \u2013 a [[filesystem API]] for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT\n* [[Open Data-Link Interface]] (ODI) \u2013 a network card API similar to NDIS\n* [[Uniform Driver Interface]] (UDI) \u2013 a cross-platform driver interface project\n* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) \u2013 C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dxd.dynax.at/|title=dxd - dynax driver framework: Main Page|website=dxd.dynax.at|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Identifiers==\nA device on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]] or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of 4 [[hexadecimal]] numbers each.

In {{Israel populations|Year}} its population was {{Israel populations|Dimona}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city's name is derived from a biblical town, mentioned in [[Joshua]] 15:21-22.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4566 Dimona renewal.JPG|thumb|Palm boulevard in Dimona]]\n\nDimona was one of the [[development town]]s created in the 1950s under the leadership of Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]]. Dimona itself was conceived in 1953. The location chosen was close to the [[Dead Sea Works]]. It was established in 1955. The first residents were Jewish immigrants from [[North Africa]], with an initial 36 families being the first to settle there. Its population in 1955 was about 300. The North African immigrants also constructed the city's houses. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, immigrants from Eastern Europe arrived. A textile factory was opened in 1958. That same year, Dimona became a [[Local council (Israel)|local council]]. In 1961, it had a population of 5,000. The emblem of Dimona (as a local council), adopted 2 March 1961, appeared on a stamp issued on 24 March 1965. Dimona was declared a city in 1969. In 1971, it had a population of 23,700.\n\nWhen the [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israeli nuclear program]] started in 1958, a location not far from the city was chosen for the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] due to its relative isolation in the desert and availability of housing. This has resulted in Dimona widely being identified with the Israeli nuclear program.\n\nIn spite of a gradual decrease during the 1980s, the city's population began to grow once again with the beginning of the [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|Russian immigration in the 1990s]]. Currently, Dimona is the third largest city in the Negev, with the population of almost 34,000. Due to projected rapid population growth in the Negev, the city is expected to triple in size by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|last=Udasin |first=Sharon |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=248711 |title=\u20181.2 million residents in the Negev by 2025\u2019 &#124; JPost &#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nDimona is described as \"mini-India\" by many for its 7,500-strong Indian Jewish community.<ref>[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/rockets-hit-mini-india-town-in-israel_946508.html Rockets hit `mini-India` town in Israel] Zee News, 10 July 2014</ref> It is also home to Israel's [[Black Hebrew]] community, formerly governed by its founder and spiritual leader, [[Ben Ammi Ben-Israel]], now deceased.<ref name=Ben_Ammi>{{cite web |url= http://africanhebrewisraelitesofjerusalem.com/?page_id=29 |publisher= African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem |title=Ben Ammi |accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> The Black Hebrews number about 3,000 in Dimona, with additional families in [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], [[Mitzpe Ramon]] and the [[Tiberias]] area. Their official status in Israel was an ongoing issue for many years, but in May 1990, the issue was resolved with the issuing of first B/1 visas, and a year later, issuing of temporary residency. Status was extended to August 2003, when the [[Israeli Ministry of Interior]] granted [[permanent residency]].\n\n==Economy==\nIn the early 1980s, textile plants, such as Dimona Textiles Ltd., dominated the industrial landscape. Many plants have since closed. Dimona Silica Industries Ltd. manufactures precipitated silica and calcium carbonate fillers. About a third of the city's population works in industrial workplaces (chemical plants near the [[Dead Sea]] like the [[Dead Sea Works]], [[high-tech]] companies and [[textile]] shops), and another third in the area of services. Due to the introduction of new technologies, many workers have been made redundant in the recent years, creating a total unemployment rate of about 10%. Dimona has taken part of [[Solar power in Israel|Israel's solar transformation]]. The Rotem Industrial Complex outside of the city has dozens of solar mirrors that focus the sun's rays on a tower that in turn heats a water boiler to create steam, turning a turbine to create electricity.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]\n\nThe company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)| Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC\u2014which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].\n\nWhen the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s the company focused on such genres as [[science fiction]], [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.\n\n===Silver Age===\n{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}\n\nIn the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the [[science-fiction]] book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's [[civilian]] identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comic books]].\n\nNational did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.\n\nSince the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the \"[[DC Universe]]\" by fans. With the story \"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\", in ''Flash'' #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes' \"Earth 1\"\u2014in the process creating the foundation for what would later be called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].\n\nDC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)<!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says \"National Comics\" in quote directly below this paragraph--> bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to [[publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]]) during a game of golf.\n<br /><br />\nHowever, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43\u201344\n{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue.

According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

Retrieved June 11, 2008.</ref> Reportedly, DC ignored the initial success of Marvel with this editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales made that impossible. However, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11\u201313|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach.

DC significantly lightened the [[tone (literature)|tone]] of many DC comics\u2014particularly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''\u2014to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous \"Go-Go Checks\" [[checkerboard]] cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip (all DC books cover dated February 1966 until August 1967) at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC's output \"stand out on the newsracks\".<ref>[http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html#009267 \"Irwin Donenfeld, R.I.P.\" by Mark Evanier, December 1, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104754/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved June 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Batman artist Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger) rose from art director to become DC's editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.\n\n===Kinney National subsidiary===\nIn 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969.  Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]\n\nIn 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be later reprinted in collected editions in a publishing format that would later be called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which would become a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions would soon become integral to the broadening of the DC Universe. Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.\n\n===The Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}\n\nFollowing the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s would become known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]\" in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' #85 (Sept. 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a [[heroin]] addict.\n\n[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".<ref>Kahn, Jenette. [http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/252/publishorial.gif \"Publishorial: Onward and Upward\"], DC Comics cover-dated September 1978.</ref> The move was not successful, however, and corporate parent Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed \"the [[DC Implosion]]\".<ref>\"The DC Implosion\", ''The Comics Journal'' #41 (August 1978), pp. 5\u20137.</ref> In September 1978, the [[line (comics)|line]] was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still increased 40 cents.<ref>\"Post-Implosion Fill-In Fallout\", ''The Comics Journal'' #43 (December 1978), p. 13.</ref> By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.\n\nSeeking new ways to boost [[market share]], the new team of publisher Kahn, vice president [[Paul Levitz]], and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end\u2014and following the example of [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Mediascene |authorlink=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |work=Mediascene |issue=11 |date=February 1975 |page='''?''' |quote=Atlas/Seaboard publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] strategy is insidiously simple and outrageous\u2014possibly even considered dirty tactics by the competition\u2014[and consists of] such [things] as higher page rates, artwork returned to the artist, rights to the creation of an original character, and a certain amount of professional courtesy.}}</ref> and such independent companies as [[Eclipse Comics]]\u2014DC began to offer [[royalties]] in place of the industry-standard [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. In addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments.\n\nThese changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George P\u00e9rez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales<ref>MacDonald, Heidi D. \"DC's Titanic Success\", ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 46\u201351.</ref> in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and P\u00e9rez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.\n\n===Modern Age===\n{{Main|Modern Age of Comic Books}}\n\nThis successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics\u2019 Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise - Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/P\u00e9rez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that would shape the DC Universe for the following decades, and separate the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine}}</ref>\n\nTwo DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side]</ref> These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.\n\n===Time Warner unit (1990\u2013present)===\nIn March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.\n\nThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectables\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.\n\nDC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.\n\nOne of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.<ref name=cbr>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21346 \"JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red\"]. Comic Book Resources. March 26, 2009</ref>\n\nDC entered into a publishing agreement with [[Milestone Media]] that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint \u2013 and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] \u2013 with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.\n\n===2000s===\nIn March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.\n\nIn 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.\n\nIn 2005, DC launched its \"[[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]]\" line (evoking the title of the [[All Star Comics|1940s publication]]), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with ''All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''All-Star Superman'', with ''All-Star Wonder Woman'' and ''All-Star Batgirl'' announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |title=Adam Hughes on His New Exclusive & All Star Wonder Woman |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=August 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202046/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |archivedate=August 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nDC licensed characters from the [[Archie Comics]] imprint [[Red Circle Comics]] by 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |date=October 30, 2008 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18636 |title=JMS Gets Brave & Bold with Archie Gang |publisher=ComicBookResources.com}}</ref> They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] followed by a miniseries that lead into two ongoing titles, each lasting 10 issues.<ref name=\"cbr\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120824-DiDio.html |title=20 Answers and 1 Question With Dan DiDio: Holiday Surprise |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=December 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] storyline.

The letters \"DC\" stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication\".\n\nThe November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication\", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC\".\n\nIn November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read \"DC Superman\". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a [[bat]] for \"House of Mystery\". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as [[trademark]]s, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.\n\nDC's \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.\n\nThe July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.\n\nIn December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that would continue in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.\n\nWhen Jenette Kahn became DC's [[Publishing|publisher]] in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nIn July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' #3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise. The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios<ref>[http://www.brainchildstudiosnyc.com/downloads/DC_brandHistory.pdf DC Comics Brand History by Brainchild Studios].

A '''linear Diophantine equation''' equates the sum of two or more [[monomials]], each of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] 1 in one of the variables, to a constant.  An '''exponential Diophantine equation''' is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns.\n\n'''Diophantine problems''' have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an [[algebraic curve]], [[algebraic surface]], or more general object, and ask about the [[lattice point]]s on it.\n\nThe word ''Diophantine'' refers to the [[Greek mathematics#Hellenistic|Hellenistic mathematician]] of the 3rd century, [[Diophantus]] of [[Alexandria]], who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce [[Mathematical symbol|symbolism]] into [[algebra]]. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called '''Diophantine analysis'''.\n\nWhile individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations (beyond the theory of [[quadratic form]]s) was an achievement of the twentieth century.\n\n==Examples==\nIn the following Diophantine equations, {{math|''w''}}, {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} are the unknowns and the other letters are given constants:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} 1}}||This is a linear Diophantine equation.\n|-\n| {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup> + ''x''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} ''y''<sup>3</sup> + ''z''<sup>3</sup>}}|| The smallest nontrivial solution in positive integers is 12<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> = 9<sup>3</sup> + 10<sup>3</sup> = 1729.

The solutions are  described by the following theorem:\n:''This Diophantine equation has a solution'' (where {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are integers) ''if and only if'' {{math|''c''}} ''is a multiple of the [[greatest common divisor]] of'' {{math|''a''}} ''and'' {{math|''b''}}. ''Moreover, if'' {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} ''is a solution, then the other solutions have the form'' {{math|(''x'' + ''kv'', ''y'' \u2212 ''ku'')}}, ''where'' {{math|''k''}} ''is an arbitrary integer, and'' {{math|''u''}} ''and'' {{math|''v''}} ''are the quotients of'' {{math|''a''}} ''and'' {{math|''b''}} ''(respectively) by the greatest common divisor of'' {{math|''a''}} ''and'' {{math|''b''}}.\n\n'''Proof:''' If {{math|''d''}} is this greatest common divisor, [[B\u00e9zout's identity]] asserts the existence of integers {{math|''e''}} and {{math|''f''}} such that {{math|''ae'' + ''bf'' {{=}} ''d''}}. If {{math|''c''}} is a multiple of {{math|''d''}}, then {{math|''c'' {{=}} ''dh''}} for some integer {{math|''h''}}, and {{math|(''eh'', ''fh'')}} is a solution. On the other hand, for every pair of integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, the greatest common divisor {{math|''d''}} of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} divides {{math|''ax'' + ''by''}}. Thus, if the equation has a solution, then {{math|''c''}} must be a multiple of {{math|''d''}}. If {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''ud''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''vd''}}, then for every solution {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}, we have\n:{{math|''a''(''x'' + ''kv'') + ''b''(''y'' \u2212 ''ku'') {{=}} ''ax'' + ''by'' + ''k''(''av'' \u2212 ''bu'') {{=}} ''ax'' + ''by'' + ''k''(''udv'' \u2212 ''vdu'') {{=}} ''ax'' + ''by''}},\nshowing that {{math|(''x'' + ''kv'', ''y'' \u2212 ''ku'')}} is another solution. Finally, given two solutions such that {{math|''ax''<sub>1</sub> + ''by''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''ax''<sub>2</sub> + ''by''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''c''}}, one deduces that {{math|''u''(''x''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>1</sub>) + ''v''(''y''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''y''<sub>1</sub>) {{=}} 0}}. As {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}} are [[coprime]], [[Euclid's lemma]] shows that {{math|''v''}} divides {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, and thus that\nthere exists an integer {{math|''k''}} such that {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''kv''}} and {{math|''y''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''y''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} \u2212''ku''}}. Therefore, {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''kv''}} and {{math|''y''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''ku''}}, which completes the proof.\n\n===Chinese remainder theorem===\n\nThe [[Chinese remainder theorem]] describes an important class of linear Diophantine systems of equations: let {{math|''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''k''</sub>}} be {{math|''k''}} [[pairwise coprime]] integers greater than one, {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>}} be {{math|''k''}} arbitrary integers, and {{math|''N''}} be the product {{math|''n''<sub>1</sub> \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ''n''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that the following linear Diophantine system has exactly one solution {{math|(''x'', ''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} such that {{math|0 \u2264 ''x'' < ''N''}}, and that the other solutions are obtained by adding to {{math|''x''}} a multiple of {{math|''N''}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx&= a_1 + n_1\\,x_1\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nx&=a_k+n_k\\,x_k\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== System of linear Diophantine equations===\nMore generally, every system of linear Diophantine equations may be solved by computing the [[Smith normal form]] of its matrix, in a way that is similar to the use of the [[reduced row echelon form]] to solve a [[system of linear equations]] over a field. Using [[matrix (mathematics)#Notation|matrix notation]] every system of linear Diophantine equations may be written\n:{{math|''A''&thinsp;''X'' {{=}} ''C''}},\nwhere {{math|''A''}} is an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix of integers, {{math|''X''}} is an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 1}} [[column matrix]] of unknowns and {{math|''C''}} is an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 1}} column matrix of integers.\n\nThe computation of the Smith normal form of {{math|''A''}} provides two [[unimodular matrix|unimodular matrices]] (that is matrices that are invertible over the integers and have \u00b11 as determinant) {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V''}} of respective dimensions {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''m''}} and {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}}, such that the matrix\n:{{math|''B'' {{=}} [''b''{{sub|''i'',''j''}}] {{=}} ''UAV''}}\nis such that {{math|''b''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub>}} is not zero for {{math|''i''}} not greater than some integer {{math|''k''}}, and all the other entries are zero. The system to be solved may thus be rewritten as\n:{{math|''B''&thinsp;(''V''{{sup|\u22121}}''X'') {{=}} ''UC''}}.\nCalling {{math|''y''<sub>''i''</sub>}} the entries of {{math|''V''{{sup|\u22121}}''X''}} and {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} those of {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''UC''}}, this leads to the system\n:{{math|''b''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub>&thinsp;''y''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''k''}},\n:{{math|0&thinsp;''y''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for {{math|''k'' < ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}}.\nThis system is equivalent to the given one in the following sense: A column matrix of integers {{math|''x''}} is a solution of the given system if and only if {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''Vy''}} for some column matrix of integers {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|''By'' {{=}} ''D''}}.\n\nIt follows that the system has a solution if and only if {{math|''b''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub>}} divides {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for {{math|''i'' \u2264 ''k''}} and {{math|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''i'' > ''k''}}. If this condition is fulfilled, the solutions of the given system are\n:<math> V\\,\\left[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{d_1}{b_{1,1}}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\frac{d_k}{b_{k,k}}\\\\\nh_{k+1}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\nh_n\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\\,, </math>\nwhere {{math|''h''<sub>''k''+1</sub>, ..., ''h''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are arbitrary integers.\n\n[[Hermite normal form]] may also be used for solving systems of linear Diophantine equations. However, Hermite normal form does not directly provide the solutions; to get the solutions from the Hermite normal form, one has to successively solve several linear equations. Nevertheless, Richard Zippel wrote that the Smith normal form \"is somewhat more than is actually needed to solve linear diophantine equations. Instead of reducing the equation to diagonal form, we only need to make it triangular, which is called the Hermite normal form. The Hermite normal form is substantially easier to compute than the Smith normal form.\"<ref name=\"Zippel1993\">{{cite book|author=Richard Zippel|title=Effective Polynomial Computation|year=1993|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-9375-7|page=50}}</ref>\n\n[[Integer linear programming]] amounts to finding some integer solutions (optimal in some sense) of linear systems that include also [[inequation]]s.

A typical such equation is the equation of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]\n:<math>x^d+y^d -z^d=0.</math>\n\nAs a homogeneous polynomial in {{mvar|n}} indeterminates defines a [[projective hypersurface|hypersurface]] in the [[projective space]] of dimension {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}}, solving a homogeneous Diophantine equation is the same as finding the [[rational point]]s of a projective hypersurface.\n\nSolving a homogeneous Diophantine equation is generally a very difficult problem, even in the simplest non-trivial case of three indeterminates (in the case of two indeterminates the problem is equivalent with testing if a [[rational number]] is the {{mvar|d}}th power of another rational number). A witness of the difficulty of the problem is Fermat's Last Theorem (for {{math|''d'' > 2}}, there is no integer solution of the above equation), which needed more than three centuries of mathematicians efforts for being solved.\n\nFor degrees higher than three, most known results are theorems asserting that there are no solutions (for example Fermat's Last Theorem) or that the number of solutions is finite (for example [[Falting's theorem]]). \n\nFor the degree three, there are general solving methods, which work on almost all equations that are encountered in practice, but no algorithm is known that works for every cubic equation.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Degree two===\nHomogeneous Diophantine equations of degree two are easier to solve. The standard solving method proceed in two steps. One has first to find one solution, or to prove that there is no solution. When a solution has been found, all solutions are then deduced.\n\nFor proving that there is no solution, one may reduce the equation [[modular arithmetic|modulo {{mvar|p}}]]. For example, the Diophantine equation\n:<math>x^2+y^2=3z^2,</math>\ndoes not have any other solution than the trivial solution {{math|(0, 0, 0)}}. In fact, by dividing {{math|''x'', ''y''}} and {{mvar|z}} by their [[greatest common divisor]], one may  suppose that they are [[coprime]]. The squares modulo 4 are congruent to 0 and 1. Thus the left-hand side of the equation is congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and the right-hand side is congruent to 0 or 3. Thus the equality may be obtained only if {{math|''x'', ''y''}} and {{mvar|z}} are all even, and are thus not coprime. Thus the only solution is the trivial solution {{math|(0, 0, 0)}}. This shows that there is no [[rational point]] on a [[circle]] of radius <math>\\sqrt{3},</math> centered at the origin.\n\nMore generally, [[Hasse principle]] allows deciding whether a homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two has an integer solution, and computing a solution if there exist. \n\nIf a non-trivial integer solution is known, one may produce all other solutions in the following way.\n\n====Geometric interpretation====\nLet \n:<math>Q(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)=0</math>\nbe a homogeneous Diophantine equation, where <math>Q(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)</math> is a [[quadratic form]] (that is, a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2), with integer coefficients. The ''trivial solution'' is the solution where all <math>x_i</math> are zero. If <math>(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)</math> is a non-trivial integer solution of this equation, then <math>\\left(a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\right)</math> are the [[homogeneous coordinates]] of a [[rational point]] of the hypersurface defined by {{mvar|Q}}. Conversely, if  <math>\\left(\\frac {p_1}q,\\ldots, \\frac {p_n}q\\right)</math> are homogeneous coordinates of a rational point of this hypersurface, where <math>q, p_1, \\ldots, p_n</math> are integers, then <math>\\left(p_1, \\ldots, p_n\\right)</math> is an integer solution of the Diophantine equation. Moreover, the integer solutions that define a given rational point are all sequences of the form \n:<math>\\left(k\\frac{p_1}d, \\ldots, k\\frac{p_n}d\\right),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|k}} is any integer, and {{mvar|d}} is the greatest common divisor of the <math>p_1.</math>\n\nIt follows that solving the Diophantine equation <math>Q(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)=0</math> is completely reduced to finding the rational points of the corresponding projective hypersurface.\n\n====Parameterization====\n\nLet now <math>A=\\left(a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\right)</math> be an integer solution of the equation <math>Q(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)=0.</math> As {{mvar|Q}} is a polynomial of degree two, a line passing through {{mvar|A}} crosses the hypersurface at a single other point, which is rational if and only if the line is rational (that is, if the line is defined by rational parameters). This allows parameterizing the hypersurface by the lines passing through {{mvar|A}}, and the rational points are the those that are obtained from rational lines, that is, those that correspond to rational values of the parameters.\n\nMore precisely, one may proceed as follows. \n\nBy permuting the indices, one may suppose, without loss of generality that <math>a_n\\ne 0.</math> Then one may pass to the affine case by considering the [[affine algebraic variety|affine hypersurface]] defined by \n:<math>q(x_1,\\ldots,x_{n-1})=Q(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1},1),</math>\nwhich has the rational point\n:<math>R= (r_1, \\ldots, r_{n-1})=\\left(\\frac{a_1}{a_n}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\\right).</math>\n\nIf this rational point is a [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]], that is if all [[partial derivative]]s are zero at {{mvar|R}}, all line passing through {{mvar|R}} are contained in the hypersurface, and one has a [[conical surface|cone]]. The change of variables \n:<math>y_i=x_i-r_i</math>\ndoes not change the rational points, and transforms {{mvar|q}} into a homogeneous polynomial in {{math|''n'' \u2013 1}} variables. In this case, the problem may thus be solved by applying the method to an equation with fewer variables.\n\nIf the polynomial {{mvar|q}} is a product of linear polynomials (possibly with non-rational coefficients), then it defines two [[hyperplane]]s. The intersection of these hyperplanes is a rational [[flat (geometry)|flat]], and contains rational singular points. This case is thus a special instance of the preceding case.\n\nIn the general case, let consider the [[parametric equation]] of a line passing through {{mvar|R}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_2&= r_2+t_2(x_1-r_1)\\\\\n\\vdots&\\\\\nx_{n-1}&= r_{n-1}+t_{n-1}(x_1-r_1).\n\\end{align}</math>\nSubstituting this in {{mvar|q}}, one gets a polynomial of degree two in <math>x_1,</math> that is zero for <math>x_1=r_1.</math> It is thus divisible by <math>x_1-r_1,</math>. The quotient is linear in <math>x_1,</math> and may be solved for expressing <math>x_1</math> as a quotient of two polynomials of degree at most two in <math>t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1},</math> with integer coefficients:\n:<math>x_1=\\frac{f_1(t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1})}{f_n(t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1})}.</math>\nSubstituting this in the expressions for <math>x_2, \\ldots, x_{n-1},</math> one gets, for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' \u2013 1}},\n:<math>x_i=\\frac{f_i(t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1})}{f_n(t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1})},</math>\nwhere <math>f_1, \\ldots, f_n</math> are polynomials of degree at most two with integer coefficients.\n\nThen, one can return to the homogeneous case. Let, for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}, \n:<math>F_i(t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1})=t_1^2 f_i\\left(\\frac{t_2}{t_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{t_{n-1}}{t_1} \\right),</math>\nbe the [[homogenization of a polynomial|homogenization]] of <math>f_i.</math> These quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients form a parameterization of the projective hypersurface defined by {{mvar|Q}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_1&= F_1(t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1})\\\\\n\\vdots&\\\\\nx_n&= F_n(t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1}).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nA point of the projective hypersurface defined by {{mvar|Q}} is rational if and only if it may be obtained from rational values of <math>t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1}.</math> As <math>F_1, \\ldots,F_n</math> are homogeneous polynomials, the point is not changed if all <math>t_i</math> are multiplied by the same rational number. Thus, one may suppose that <math>t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1}</math> are [[coprime integers]]. It follows that the integer solutions of the Diophantine equation are exactly the sequences <math>(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)</math> where, for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}},\n:<math>x_i= k\\,\\frac{F_i(t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1})}{d},</math>\nwhere {{mvar|k}} is an integer, <math>t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1}</math> are coprime integers, and {{mvar|d}} is the greatest common divisor of the {{mvar|n}} integers <math>F_i(t_1, \\ldots, t_{n-1}).</math>\n\nOne could hope that the coprimality of the <math>t_i</math> could imply that {{math|1=''d'' = 1}}. Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown in the next section.\n\n====Example of Pythagorean triples====\nThe equation \n:<math>x^2+y^2-z^2=0</math>\nis probably the first homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two that has been studied. Its solutions are the [[Pythagorean triple]]s. This is also the homogeneous equation of the [[unit circle]]. In this section, we show how the above method allows retrieving [[Euclid's formula]] for generating Pythagorean triples.\n\nFor retrieving exactly Euclid's formula, we start from the solution {{math|(-1, 0, 1)}}, corresponding to the point {{math|(-1, 0)}} of the unit circle. A line passing through this point may be parameterized by its slope:\n:<math>y=t(x+1).</math>\nPutting this in the circle equation \n:<math>x^2+y^2-1=0,</math>\none gets \n:<math>x^2-1 +t^2(x+1)^2=0.</math>\nDividing by {{math|''x'' + 1}}, results in\n:<math>x-1+t^2(x+1)=0,</math>\nwhich is easy to solve in {{mvar|x}}:\n:<math>x=\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.</math>\nIt follows\n:<math>y=t(x+1) = \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}.</math>\nHomogenizing as described above one gets all solutions as \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx&=k\\,\\frac{s^2-t^2}{d}\\\\\ny&=k\\,\\frac{2st}{d}\\\\\nz&=k\\,\\frac{s^2+t^2}{d},\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|k}} is any integer, {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} are coprime integers, and {{mvar|d}} is the greatest common divisor of the three numerators. In fact, {{math|1=''d'' = 2}} if {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} are both odd, and {{math|1=''d'' = 1}} if one is odd and the other is even.\n\nThe ''primitive triples'' are the solutions where {{math|1=''k'' = 1}} and {{math|''s'' > ''t'' > 0}}.\n\nThis description of the solutions differs slightly from Euclid's formula because Euclid's formula considers only the solutions such that {{math|''x'', ''y''}} and {{mvar|z}} are all positive, and does not distinguish between two triples that differ by the exchange of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}},\n\n==Diophantine analysis==\n\n=== Typical questions ===\n\nThe questions asked in Diophantine analysis include:\n\n#Are there any solutions?\n#Are there any solutions beyond some that are easily found by [[List of mathematical jargon#Proof techniques|inspection]]?\n#Are there finitely or infinitely many solutions?\n#Can all solutions be found in theory?\n#Can one in practice compute a full list of solutions?\n\nThese traditional problems often lay unsolved for centuries, and mathematicians gradually came to understand their depth (in some cases), rather than treat them as puzzles.\n\n=== Typical problem ===\nThe given information is that a father's age is 1 less than twice that of his son, and that the digits {{math|''AB''}} making up the father's age are reversed in the son's age (i.e. {{math|''BA''}}). This leads to the equation {{math|10''A'' + ''B'' {{=}} 2(10''B'' + ''A'') \u2212 1}}, thus {{math|19''B'' \u2212 8''A'' {{=}} 1}}. Inspection gives the result {{math|''A'' {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''B'' {{=}} 3}}, and thus {{math|''AB''}} equals 73 years and {{math|''BA''}} equals 37 years. One may easily show that there is not any other solution with {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} positive integers less than 10.\n\nMany well known puzzles in the field of [[recreational mathematics]] lead to diophantine equations.  Examples include the [[Cannonball problem]], [[Archimedes's cattle problem]] and [[The monkey and the coconuts]].\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nIn 1637, [[Pierre de Fermat]] scribbled on the margin of his copy of ''[[Arithmetica]]'': \"It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second into two like powers.\" Stated in more modern language, \"The equation {{math|''a''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''n''</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>''n''</sup>}} has no solutions for any {{math|''n''}} higher than 2.\" And then he wrote, intriguingly: \"I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this proposition, which this margin is too narrow to contain.\" Such a proof eluded mathematicians for centuries, however, and as such his statement became famous as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. It wasn't until 1995 that it was proven by the British mathematician [[Andrew Wiles]].\n\nIn 1657, Fermat attempted to solve the Diophantine equation {{math|61''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} ''y''<sup>2</sup>}} (solved by [[Brahmagupta]] over 1000 years earlier). The equation was eventually solved by [[Euler]] in the early 18th century, who also solved a number of other Diophantine equations. The smallest solution of this equation in positive integers is {{math|''x'' {{=}} 226153980}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} 1766319049}} (see [[Chakravala method]]).\n\n===Hilbert's tenth problem===\n{{main article|Hilbert's tenth problem}}\nIn 1900, [[David Hilbert]] proposed the solvability of all Diophantine equations as [[Hilbert's tenth problem|the tenth]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|fundamental problems]]. In 1970, [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] solved it negatively, by proving that a general [[algorithm]] for solving all Diophantine equations [[proof of impossibility|cannot exist]].\n\n===Diophantine geometry===\n[[Diophantine geometry]], which is the application of techniques from [[algebraic geometry]] in this field, has continued to grow as a result; since treating arbitrary equations is a dead end, attention turns to equations that also have a geometric meaning. The central idea of Diophantine geometry is that of a [[rational point]], namely a solution to a polynomial equation or a [[system of polynomial equations]], which is a vector in a prescribed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}}, when {{math|''K''}} is ''not''  [[algebraically closed]].\n\n===Modern research===\nOne of the few general approaches is through the [[Hasse principle]]. [[Infinite descent]] is the traditional method, and has been pushed a long way.\n\nThe depth of the study of general Diophantine equations is shown by the characterisation of [[Diophantine set]]s as equivalently described as [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]]. In other words, the general problem of Diophantine analysis is blessed or cursed with universality, and in any case is not something that will be solved except by re-expressing it in other terms.\n\nThe field of [[Diophantine approximation]] deals with the cases of ''Diophantine inequalities''. Here variables are still supposed to be integral, but some coefficients may be irrational numbers, and the equality sign is replaced by upper and lower bounds.\n\nThe most celebrated single question in the field, the [[conjecture]] known as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], was solved by [[Andrew Wiles]]<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html Solving Fermat: Andrew Wiles]</ref> but using tools from algebraic geometry developed during the last century rather than within number theory where the conjecture was originally formulated. Other major results, such as [[Faltings's theorem]], have disposed of old conjectures.\n\n===Infinite Diophantine equations===\nAn example of an infinite diophantine equation is:\n:{{math|''n'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>2</sup> + 2''b''<sup>2</sup> + 3''c''<sup>2</sup> + 4''d''<sup>2</sup> + 5''e''<sup>2</sup> + \u2026}},\nwhich can be expressed as \"How many ways can a given integer {{math|''n''}} be written as the sum of a square plus twice a square plus thrice a square and so on?\" The number of ways this can be done for each {{math|''n''}} forms an integer sequence. Infinite Diophantine equations are related to [[theta functions]] and infinite dimensional lattices. This equation always has a solution for any positive {{math|''n''}}. Compare this to:\n:{{math|''n'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>2</sup> + 4''b''<sup>2</sup> + 9''c''<sup>2</sup> + 16''d''<sup>2</sup> + 25''e''<sup>2</sup> + \u2026}},\nwhich does not always have a solution for positive {{math|''n''}}.\n\n==Exponential Diophantine equations==\nIf a Diophantine equation has as an additional variable or variables occurring as [[exponentiation|exponents]], it is an exponential Diophantine equation. Examples include the [[Ramanujan\u2013Nagell equation]], {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 7 {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, and the equation of the [[Fermat-Catalan conjecture]] and [[Beal's conjecture]], {{math|''a''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''n''</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>''k''</sup>}} with inequality restrictions on the exponents. A general theory for such equations is not available; particular cases such as [[Catalan's conjecture]] have been tackled. However, the majority are solved via ad hoc methods such as [[St\u00f8rmer's theorem]] or even [[trial and error]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka]], [[Aryabhata]]'s algorithm for solving linear Diophantine equations in two unknowns\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| first=L.

This led to tremendous advances in [[number theory]], and the study of [[Diophantine equation]]s (\"Diophantine geometry\") and of [[Diophantine approximation]]s remain important areas of mathematical research.

Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and Diophantus, [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \"Hellenized,\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.\"}}</ref> Hellenized [[Babylonia]]n,<ref>D. M. Burton (1991, 1995).

One of the problems (sometimes called his epitaph) states:\n\n:'Here lies Diophantus,' the wonder behold.\n:Through art algebraic, the stone tells how old:\n:'God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of his life,\n:One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife;\n:And then yet one-seventh ere marriage begun;\n:In five years there came a bouncing new son.\n:Alas, the dear child of master and sage\n:After attaining half the measure of his father's life chill fate took him. After consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four years, he ended his life.'\n\nThis puzzle implies that Diophantus' age {{math|''x''}} can be expressed as\n\n:{{math|''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''|6}} + {{sfrac|''x''|12}} + {{sfrac|''x''|7}} + 5 + {{sfrac|''x''|2}} + 4}}\n\nwhich gives {{math|''x''}} a value of 84 years. However, the accuracy of the information cannot be independently confirmed.\n\nIn popular culture, this puzzle was the Puzzle No.142 in ''[[Professor Layton and Pandora's Box]]'' as one of the hardest solving puzzles in the game, which needed to be unlocked by solving other puzzles first.\n\n==''Arithmetica''==\n{{see also|Arithmetica}}\n\n''Arithmetica'' is the major work of Diophantus and the most prominent work on algebra in Greek mathematics. It is a collection of problems giving numerical solutions of both determinate and indeterminate [[equation]]s. Of the original thirteen books of which ''Arithmetica'' consisted only six have survived, though there are some who believe that four Arabic books discovered in 1968 are also by Diophantus.<ref name=\"Books IV-VII of Diophantus' Arithmetica\">{{cite book | title=Books IV to VII of Diophantus' ''Arithmetica'' in the Arabic Translation Attributed to Qusta ibn Luqa | author = J. Sesiano | location = New York/Heidelberg/Berlin | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1982 | page = 502}}</ref> Some Diophantine problems from ''Arithmetica'' have been found in Arabic sources.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that Diophantus never used general methods in his solutions. [[Hermann Hankel]], renowned German mathematician made the following remark regarding Diophantus.\n\n\u201cOur author (Diophantos) not the slightest trace of a general, comprehensive method is discernible; each problem calls for some special method which refuses to work even for the most closely related problems.  For this reason it is difficult for the modern scholar to solve the 101st problem even after having studied 100 of Diophantos\u2019s solutions\u201d <ref>Hankel H., \u201cGeschichte der mathematic im altertum und mittelalter, Leipzig, 1874. (translated to English by Ulrich Lirecht in Chinese Mathematics in the thirteenth century, Dover publications, New York, 1973.</ref>\n\n===History===\nLike many other Greek mathematical treatises, Diophantus was forgotten in Western Europe during the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], since the study of ancient Greek, and literacy in general, had greatly declined.  The portion of the Greek ''Arithmetica'' that survived, however, was, like all ancient Greek texts transmitted to the early modern world, copied by, and thus known to, medieval Byzantine scholars. Scholia on Diophantus by the Byzantine Greek scholar [[John Chortasmenos]] (1370\u20131437) are preserved together with a comprehensive commentary written by the earlier Greek scholar [[Maximos Planudes]] (1260 \u2013 1305), who produced an edition of Diophantus within the library of the [[Chora Monastery]] in Byzantine [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, some portion of the ''Arithmetica'' probably survived in the Arab tradition (see above). In 1463 German mathematician [[Regiomontanus]] wrote:\n\n: \u201cNo one has yet translated from the Greek into Latin the thirteen books of Diophantus, in which the very flower of the whole of arithmetic lies hidden . . . .\u201d\n\n''Arithmetica'' was first translated from Greek into [[Latin]] by [[Rafael Bombelli|Bombelli]] in 1570, but the translation was never published. However, Bombelli borrowed many of the problems for his own book ''Algebra''. The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of ''Arithmetica'' was published in 1575 by [[Guilielmus Xylander|Xylander]]. The best known Latin translation of ''Arithmetica'' was made by [[Bachet]] in 1621 and became the first Latin edition that was widely available. [[Pierre de Fermat]] owned a copy, studied it, and made notes in the margins.\n\n===Margin-writing by Fermat and Chortasmenos===\n[[File:Diophantus-II-8-Fermat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Problem II.8 in the ''Arithmetica'' (edition of 1670), annotated with Fermat's comment which became [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].]]\n\nThe 1621 edition of ''Arithmetica'' by [[Bachet]] gained fame after [[Pierre de Fermat]] wrote his famous \"[[Fermat's Last Theorem|Last Theorem]]\" in the margins of his copy:\n\n:\u201cIf an integer {{math|''n''}} is greater than 2, then {{math|''a''{{sup|''n''}} + ''b''{{sup|''n''}} {{=}} ''c''{{sup|''n''}}}} has no solutions in non-zero integers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}. I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.\u201d\n\nFermat's proof was never found, and the problem of finding a proof for the theorem went unsolved for centuries. A proof was finally found in 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]] after working on it for seven years.  It is believed that Fermat did not actually have the proof he claimed to have. Although the original copy in which Fermat wrote this is lost today, Fermat's son edited the next edition of Diophantus, published in 1670. Even though the text is otherwise inferior to the 1621 edition, Fermat's annotations\u2014including the \"Last Theorem\"\u2014were printed in this version.\n\nFermat was not the first mathematician so moved to write in his own marginal notes to Diophantus; the Byzantine scholar [[John Chortasmenos]] (1370\u20131437) had written \"Thy soul, Diophantus, be with Satan because of the difficulty of your other theorems and particularly of the present theorem\" next to the same problem.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zrGDDwQLo8C&lpg=PA322&ots=DUgiZhE8gF&pg=PA322#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Margins and Metropolis: Authority across the Byzantine Empire|last=Herrin|first=Judith|date=2013-03-18|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=140084522X|page=322|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Other works==\n\nDiophantus wrote several other books besides ''Arithmetica'', but very few of them have survived.\n\n===The ''Porisms''===\nDiophantus himself refers{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} to a work which consists of a collection of [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] called ''The Porisms'' (or ''Porismata''), but this book is entirely lost.\n\nAlthough ''The Porisms'' is lost, we know three lemmas contained there, since Diophantus refers to them in the ''Arithmetica''. One lemma states that the difference of the cubes of two rational numbers is equal to the sum of the cubes of two other rational numbers, i.e. given any {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, with {{math|''a'' > ''b''}}, there exist {{math|''c'' and ''d''}}, all positive and rational, such that\n\n:{{math|''a''{{sup|3}} \u2212 ''b''{{sup|3}} {{=}} ''c''{{sup|3}} + ''d''{{sup|3}}}}.\n\n===Polygonal numbers and geometric elements===\nDiophantus is also known to have written on [[polygonal number]]s, a topic of great interest to [[Pythagoras]] and [[Pythagoreans]]. Fragments of a book dealing with polygonal numbers are extant<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Diophantus.html|title=Diophantus biography|author=|date=|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>.\n\nA book called ''Preliminaries to the Geometric Elements'' has been traditionally attributed to [[Hero of Alexandria]]. It has been studied recently by [[Wilbur Knorr]], who suggested that the attribution to Hero is incorrect, and that the true author is Diophantus.<ref>Knorr, Wilbur: Arithm\u00eatike stoichei\u00f4sis: On Diophantus and Hero of Alexandria, in: Historia Matematica, New York, 1993, Vol.20, No.2, 180-192</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n\nDiophantus' work has had a large influence in history. Editions of  Arithmetica exerted a profound influence on the development of algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries.  Diophantus and his works have also influenced [[Arab mathematics]] and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus' work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra. As far as we know Diophantus did not affect the lands of the Orient much and how much he affected India is a matter of debate.\n\nDiophantus is often called \u201cthe father of algebra\" because he contributed greatly to number theory, mathematical notation, and because Arithmetica contains the earliest known use of syncopated notation.<ref>Carl B. Boyer, A History of Mathematics, Second Edition (Wiley, 1991), page 228</ref>\n\n==Diophantine analysis==\n{{see also|Diophantine equation}}\n\nToday, Diophantine analysis is the area of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most of the problems in Arithmetica lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations: {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' {{=}} ''c''}}, {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} {{=}} ''bx'' + ''c''}}, and {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''c'' {{=}} ''bx''}}. The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while today we have only one case, is that he did not have any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} to all be positive in each of the three cases above.  Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered [[Negative numbers|negative]] or irrational square root solutions \"useless\", \"meaningless\", and even \"absurd\". To give one specific example, he calls the equation {{math|4 {{=}} 4''x'' + 20}} 'absurd' because it would lead to a negative value for {{math|''x''}}. One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations.\n\n==Mathematical notation==\n\nDiophantus made important advances in mathematical notation, becoming the first person known to use algebraic notation and symbolism. Before him everyone wrote out equations completely. Diophantus introduced an algebraic symbolism that used an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown. Mathematical historian Kurt Vogel states:<ref>Kurt Vogel, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901182.html \"Diophantus of Alexandria.\"]  in Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Encyclopedia.com, 2008.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\u201cThe symbolism that Diophantus introduced for the first time, and undoubtedly devised himself, provided a short and readily comprehensible means of expressing an equation... Since an abbreviation is also employed for the word \u2018equals\u2019, Diophantus took a fundamental step from verbal algebra towards symbolic algebra.\u201d\n</blockquote>\nAlthough Diophantus made important advances in symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more general methods. This caused his work to be more concerned with particular problems rather than general situations. Some of the limitations of Diophantus' notation are that he only had notation for one unknown and, when problems involved more than a single unknown, Diophantus was reduced to expressing \"first unknown\", \"second unknown\", etc. in words. He also lacked a symbol for a general number {{math|''n''}}. Where we would write {{math|{{sfrac|12 + 6''n''|''n''{{sup|2}} \u2212 3}}}}, Diophantus has to resort to constructions like:  \"... a sixfold number increased by twelve, which is divided by the difference by which the square of the number exceeds three\".\n\nAlgebra still had a long way to go before very general problems could be written down and solved succinctly.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Erd\u0151s\u2013Diophantine graph]]\n* [[Diophantus II.VIII]]\n* [[Polynomial Diophantine equation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|60em}}\n\n==References==\n* Allard, A. \"Les scolies aux arithm\u00e9tiques de Diophante d'Alexandrie dans le Matritensis Bibl.Nat.4678 et les Vatican Gr.191 et 304\" ''Byzantion'' 53.

His father was a policeman. His mother Julia Pa{{okina}}akonia Lonokahikina Paoa was a deeply religious woman with a strong sense of family ancestry.\n\nEven though not of the formal Hawaiian Royal Family, his parents were from prominent Hawaiian [[ohana]] (family); the Kahanamoku and the Paoa ohana were considered to be lower-ranking nobles, who were in service to the ''[[ali\u02bbi]] nui'' or royalty.<ref name=\"Nendel\"/> His paternal grandfather was Kahanamoku and his grandmother, Kapiolani Kaoeha (sometimes spelled ''Kahoea''), a descendant of [[Alapainui]].

His maternal grandparents Paoa, son of Paoa Hoolae and Hiikaalani, and Mele Uliama were also of ali\u02bbi descent.<ref name=\"Hall\"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Brennan1968\">{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Joe|title=Duke of Hawaii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3DBfTR8QtYHj8C|year=1968|publisher= |location= |pages=74\u201376}}</ref>\n\nGrowing up on the outskirts of Waikiki, Kahanamoku spent his youth as a bronzed beach boy. At Waikiki Beach he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his \"papa nui\", constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian \"olo\" boards. Made from the wood of a [[koa]] tree, it was {{convert|16|ft|m}} long and weighed {{convert|114|lb|kg}}. The board was without a [[Skeg#Surfing|skeg]], which had yet to be invented. In his later career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.\n\nOn August 11, 1911, Kahanamoku was timed at 55.4 seconds in the {{convert|100|yd|m}} [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]], beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor. He also broke the record in the {{convert|220|yd|m|abbr=on}} and equaled it in the {{convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on}}. But the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), in disbelief, would not recognize these feats until many years later. The AAU initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided Kahanamoku.<ref>[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC \"Duke Kahanamoku.

At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in Stockholm, he won a gold medal in the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100-meter freestyle]], and a silver medal with the second-place U.S. team in the [[Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|men's 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay]].  During the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]] in Antwerp, he won gold medals both in the 100 meters (bettering fellow Hawaiian [[Pua Kealoha]]) and in the relay.  He finished the 100 meters with a silver medal during the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris, with the gold going to [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and the bronze to Duke's brother, [[Samuel Kahanamoku]].  At age 34, this was Kahanamoku's last Olympic medal.<ref name=Murphy/> He also was an alternate for the U.S. water polo team at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]].\n\n=== Post Olympic Career ===\n\nBetween Olympic competitions, and after retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions. It was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii, by incorporating surfing exhibitions into these visits as well. His surfing exhibition at Sydney's [[Freshwater Beach]] on December 24, 1914 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Osmond, Gary. | year = 2010 | title = 'Honolulu M\u0101ori': Racial Dimensions of Duke Kahanamoku's Tour of Australia and New Zealand | url =  | journal = New Zealand Journal of History | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 22\u201334 }}</ref> The board that Kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the Freshwater Surf Club.

In this way, he made connections with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing. Kahanamoku was involved with the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]], acting as lifeguard and competing on both swimming and water polo teams.\n\nWhile living in [[Newport Beach, California]] on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while attempting to enter the city's harbor.<ref>{{cite news |author= |author2= |title=Kahanamoku Helps Save 13 in Launch.

Newport's police chief at the time called Duke's efforts \"the most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen\". It also caused U.S. lifeguards to begin using surfboards in their water rescues.<ref name=\"Men's Journal\"/>\n\nIn 1940, he married Nadine Alexander, who accompanied him when he traveled. Kahanamoku was the first person to be inducted into both the [[Swimming Hall of Fame]] and the [[Surfing Hall of Fame]]. The [[Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship]]s are named in his honor. He is a member of the [[United States Olympic Hall of Fame|U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame]]. He served as sheriff of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] from 1932 to 1961, serving 13 consecutive terms. During this period, he also appeared in a number of television programs and films, such as ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955).\n\nKahanamoku was a friend and surfing companion of heiress [[Doris Duke]], who built a home (now a museum) on Oahu named [[Shangri La (Doris Duke)|Shangri-la]].\n\n== ''Duncan v. Kahanamoku'' ==\n{{Further|Duncan v. Kahanamoku}}\nIn 1946, Kahanamoku was the ''[[pro forma]]'' defendant in the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Duncan v. Kahanamoku]]''. While Kahanamoku was a [[military police]] officer during [[World War II]], he arrested Duncan, a civilian [[shipfitter]], for public intoxication. At the time, Hawaii, not yet a state, was being administered under the [[Hawaiian Organic Act]] which effectively instituted [[martial law]] on the island. Duncan was therefore tried by a military tribunal and appealed to the Supreme Court. In a ''post hoc'' ruling, the court ruled that trial by military tribunal was, in this case, [[unconstitutional]].<ref>''[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/327/304/case.html Duncan v.

Reverend [[Abraham Akaka]], the pastor of [[Kawaiahao Church]], performed the service, a group of beach boys sang Hawaiian songs, including \"[[Aloha Oe]]\", and his ashes were scattered into the ocean. The City of Honolulu commemorated this Waikiki Beach burial site in 1990 with a 9-foot cast bronze statue of Kahanamoku by Jan Gordon Fisher that shows Kahanamoku with outstretched arms in front of his surfboard and honorary Hawaiian spears, and includes a dedication plaque and a historic information marker.  The statue's orientation that placed Kahanamoku's back to the sea was initially criticized as being contrary to Hawaiian custom, yet its orientation toward the pedestrian activity and public realm on Kalakaua Avenue created an immensely popular local shrine and tourist locale; the outstretched arms are always adorned with fresh leis.  The Kahanamoku statue receives annual tribute ceremonies and thousands of yearly tourist visits.  In 1997, the historic public artwork ''The Stones of Life'', containing four ancient basaltic stones or p\u014dhaku (circa 1500), was installed nearby.  A 24-hour live web camera is also installed at the statue so that visitors from around the world can be viewed.\n\nHawaii music promoter [[Kimo Wilder McVay]] capitalized on Kahanamoku's popularity by naming his Waikiki showroom \"Duke Kahanamoku's,\" and giving Kahanamoku a financial interest in the showroom in exchange for the use of his name. It was a major Waikiki showroom in the 1960s and is remembered as the home of [[Don Ho]] & The Aliis from 1964 through 1969. The showroom continued to be known as Duke Kahanamoku's until Hawaii showman Jack Cione bought it in the mid-1970s and renamed it Le Boom Boom.\n\nKahanamoku's name is also used by Duke's Canoe Club & Barefoot Bar, {{as of|2016|lc=y}} known as Duke's Waikiki, a beachfront bar and restaurant in the [[Outrigger Hotels & Resorts|Outrigger]] Waikiki on the Beach Hotel. There is a chain of restaurants named after him in California, Florida and Hawaii called Duke's.\n\nOn August 24, 2002, the 112th anniversary of Kahanamoku's birth, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] issued a first-class [[commemorative stamp]] with Duke's picture on it. The First Day Ceremony was held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and was attended by thousands. At this ceremony, attendees could attach the Duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a First Day of Issue postmark. These [[first day cover]]s are very collectible.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209204134/http://www.usps.com/news/2002/philatelic/sr02_048.htm Father Of International Surfing To Be Honored On New Postage Stamp].

The current statutory authorization for the Distinguished Service Medal is Title 10, [[United States Code]], Section 3743.\n\n==Recipients==\n{{see also|Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States)}}\n*Among the first awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for service in World War I, were those to the Commanding Officers of the Allied Armies:\n#Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]]\n#Marshal [[Joseph Joffre]],\n#General [[Philippe Petain]] of France,\n#General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] of France,\n#General Sir [[Arthur Currie]] of Canada,\n#General Sir [[John Monash]] of Australia,\n#Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig]] of Britain,\n#General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy,\n#General [[Cyriaque Gillain]] of Belgium,\n#General [[John Joseph Pershing]] - United States\n#[[Field marshal (Serbia and Yugoslavia)|Field Marshal]] [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]] of Serbia\n\nMore than 2,000 awards were made during World War I, and by the time the United States entered World War II, approximately 2,800 awards had been made.  From July 1, 1941 to June 6, 1969, when the Army stopped publishing awards of the DSM in Department of the Army General Orders, over 2,800 further awards were made.<ref>George H. Apgar (1995), ''Awards of the US Army Distinguished Service Medal 1942-1969'', Planchet Press</ref>\n\nPrior to World War II the DSM was the only decoration for non-combat service in the U.S. Army.  As a result, before World War II the DSM was awarded to a wider range of recipients than during and after World War II.  During World War I awards of the DSM to officers below the rank of brigadier general were fairly common but became rare once the [[Legion of Merit]] was established in 1942. \n\nUntil the first award of the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1965, [[United States Air Force]] personnel received this award as well, as was the case with several other Army decorations until the Air Force fully established its own system of decorations.\n\n===Notable recipients===\nBecause the Army Distinguished Service Medal is principally awarded to general officers, a list of notable recipients would include nearly every general, and some admirals, since 1918, many of whom received multiple awards, as well as a few civilians and sergeants major prominent for their contributions to national defense.\n\nGeneral [[Martin Dempsey]], former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], has the record for the greatest number of awards received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal at six.  He also received three awards of the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]] as well as one award each of the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]], and the [[Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal]], for a total of twelve Distinguished Service Medals. \n\nGenerals of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] are tied with five awards each received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal.  They also each received one award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, for a total of six DSMs each.\n\nGeneral [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] received two awards of the Army DSM and one award each of the Defense DSM, Navy DSM, the Air Force DSM and the Coast Guard DSM, for a total of six DSMs.\n\nGeneral [[Lloyd Austin]] received four awards of the Army DSM and five awards of the Defense DSM for a total of nine DSMs.\n\nAmong notable recipients below flag rank are: X-1 test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]] and X-15 test pilot [[Robert M. White]], who both received the DSM as U.S. Air Force majors; Air Force Major [[Rudolf Anderson]], the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] pilot shot down during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; director [[Frank Capra]], decorated in 1945 as an Army colonel; actor [[James Stewart]], decorated in 1945 as an Army Air Forces colonel (later Air Force Brigadier General); Colonel [[Wendell Fertig]], who led Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines; Colonel (later Major General) [[John K. Singlaub]], who led partisan forces in the Korean War; and Major Maude C. Davison, who led the \"[[Angels of Bataan]] and Corregidor\" during their imprisonment by the Japanese, and Colonel William S. Taylor, Program Manager Multiple Launch Rocket System. Among notable civilian recipients are [[Harry L. Hopkins]], [[Robert S. McNamara]] and [[Henry L. Stimson]].\n\nNotable American and foreign recipients include:\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===United States Army===\n*General of the Armies [[John J.

The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is awarded only while assigned to a joint activity. Normally, such responsibilities deserving of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are held by the most senior officers such as the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the Chiefs and Vice Chiefs of the Services, and Commanders and Deputy Commanders of the [[Combatant Command]]s, the [[Director of the Joint Staff]] etc., whose duties bring them frequently into direct contact with the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], and other senior government officials. In addition, the medal may also be awarded to other service members whose direct and individual contributions to national security or national defense are recognized as being so exceptional in scope and value as to be equivalent to contributions normally associated with positions encompassing broader responsibilities.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/defense_distinguished.aspx]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis decoration takes precedence over the Distinguished Service Medals of the separate services and is not to be awarded to any individual for a period of service for which an [[Army Distinguished Service Medal|Army]], [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Navy]], [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal|Air Force]] or [[Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal]] is awarded.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe medal is gold in color and on the obverse it features a medium blue [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] pentagon (point up). Superimposed on this is an [[Bald eagle|American bald eagle]] with wings outspread facing left grasping three crossed arrows in its talons and on its breast is a shield of the United States. The pentagon and eagle are enclosed within a gold pieced circle consisting, in the upper half of 13 five-pointed stars and in the lower half, a wreath of [[Bay laurel|laurel]] on the left and [[olive]] on the right. At the top is a suspender of five graduated gold rays. The reverse of the medal has the inscription \"''For Distinguished Service''\" at the top in raised letters, and within the pentagon the inscription \"''From The Secretary of Defense To,''\" all in raised letters.\n\nAdditional awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters.\n\n==Notable recipients==\n*[[Jonathan Howe]] (six awards)\n*[[Lloyd Austin]] (five awards)\n*[[Raymond T.

Areas with ravines or forests, such as [[Chambal division|Chambal]] and [[Chilapata Forests]], were once known for dacoits.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"dacoity\", the [[anglicise|anglicized]] version of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''\u1e0dakait\u012b'' (historically spelled ''dakaitee'', [[Hindi]]  \u0921\u0915\u0948\u0924\u0940 or [[Urdu]] \u0688\u06a9\u06cc\u062a\u06cc or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] \u09a1\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a4\u09bf, or Odiya \u0b21\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b5f\u0b24\u0b3f ), comes from ''\u1e0d\u0101k\u016b'' (historically spelled ''dakoo'', [[Hindi]]: \u0921\u093e\u0915\u0942, [[Urdu]]: \u0688\u0627\u06a9\u0648, meaning \"armed robber\") or [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ''\u1e0dakat'' (\u09a1\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a4, or Odiya \u0b21\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b5f\u0b24\u0b3f).\n\nIn [[Urdu language|Urdu]], ''\u1e0d\u0101k\u016b'' \u0688\u0627\u06a9\u0648 is [[Singular number|singular]] and ''\u1e0dakait'' \u0688\u06a9\u06cc\u062a [[plural]] for [[bandit]]s. The crime of banditry is known as ''dakaitee'' \u0688\u06a9\u06cc\u062a\u06cc.\n\nIn [[Hindi]], ''dacoity'' ([[Hindi]]: \u0921\u0915\u0948\u0924\u0940 ''\u1e0dakait\u012b'', [[Urdu]]: \u0688\u06a9\u06cc\u062a\u06cc ''\u1e0dakait\u012b'', [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: \u09a1\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a4\u09bf  ''\u1e0dakati'', or Odiya \u0b21\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b5f\u0b24\u0b3f) means \"armed [[robbery]]\".\n\nThe term '''dacoit''' ([[Hindi]]: \u0921\u0915\u0948\u0924 ''\u1e0dakait'', [[Urdu]]: \u0688\u06a9\u06cc\u062a ''\u1e0dakait'', [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: \u09a1\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a4 ''\u1e0d\u0101k\u0101t'', or Odiya \u0b21\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b5f\u0b24\u0b3f) means \"a [[bandit]]\", according to the ''[[OED]]'' (\"A member of a class of robbers in India and [[Burma]], who plunder in armed bands.\") \n\n==History==\n\nThe dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and [[Chambal Division|Chambal]] regions in [[Madhya Pradesh]] in north-central India.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley has been a popular theme (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley.\n\nThe term is also applied, according to the ''[[OED]]'', to \"pirates who formerly infested the [[Ganges]] between [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Baharampur|Burhampore]]\".\n\nDacoits existed in Burma as well \u2013 [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in \"[[The Taking of Lungtungpen]]\". [[Sax Rohmer]]'s criminal mastermind [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]] also employed Burmese dacoits as his [[henchmen]]. \n\nIndian police forces use \"Known Dacoit\" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.\n\n==Notable Dacoits==\n[[File:A family of Indian dacoits (c. 1900s).jpg|thumbnail|A family of Indian dacoits]]\nNotable dacoits include:\n*[[Gabbar Singh Gujjar]], inspired the famous 1975 film [[Sholay]], based on his life<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32493120}}</ref>                            \n*[[Veerappan]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2t7sAAAAMAAJ&dq=Veerappan+criminal&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=criminal| title= Industrial Economist, Volume 37 | publisher= Industrial Publications | work= Industries | date= 2004 | author= S.

The chief minister of the state, [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]], recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.<ref>[http://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/05/27/indian-women-granted-gun-permits-to-fend-off-armed-robbers/ \"Indian Women Granted Gun Permits to Fend Off Armed Robbers\"]  LearnAboutGuns.com</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Dacoit films===\nAs the dacoits flourished through the 1940s\u20131970s, they were the subject of various [[Hindi films]] made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in [[Bollywood]]. The genre began with [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aurat (1940 film)|Aurat]]'' (1940), which he remade as ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957). ''Mother India'' received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with [[Dilip Kumar]]'s ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' (1961).<ref name=\"Teo\">{{cite book|last=Teo|first=Stephen|title=Eastern Westerns: Film and Genre Outside and Inside Hollywood|date=2017|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317592266|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi8lDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA122|language=en}}</ref> Other popular films in this genre included [[Raj Kapoor]]\u2019s ''[[Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai]]'' (1961) and [[Moni Bhattacharjee]]'s ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963).<ref>{{cite web |title= THE REAL LIFE HERO|url=http://www.screenindia.com/news/THE-REAL-LIFE-HERO/318575/ |date=Jun 6, 2008|publisher=[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]}}</ref>\n\nPakistani actor [[Akmal Khan]] had two dacoit films, ''[[Malangi]]'' (1965) and ''[[Imam Din Gohavia]]'' (1967). Other films in this genre included ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973), ''[[Mera Gaon Mera Desh]]'' (1971), and ''[[Kuchhe Dhaage]]'' (1973) both by [[Raj Khosla]].\n\nThe most famous dacoit film is ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), written by [[Salim-Javed]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], and with its dacoit character [[Gabbar Singh (character)|Gabbar Singh]] played by [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]]. It was a [[masala film]] that combined the dacoit film conventions of ''Mother India'' and ''Gunga Jumna'' with that of [[Spaghetti Western]]s, spawning the [[Curry Western|Dacoit Western]] genre,<ref name=\"Teo\"/> often known as the \"[[Curry Western]]\" genre. ''Sholay'' became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including ''[[Ganga Ki Saugandh]]'' (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.\n\nPunjabi biopic ''[[Jatt Jeona Morh (1991 film)|Jatt Jeona Morh]]'' about the noted dacoit Jatt Jeona Morh, was made in 1991; also in that same year came ''[[Jagga Daku (1991 film)|Jagga Daku]]'', based on a noted outlaw and dacoit during the British Raj, Jagga Daku.\n\nAn internationally acclaimed example of the genre is ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994).\n\nTamil movie, Karthi starrer ''[[Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru]]'' (2017) deals elaborately about Bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director [[H. Vinoth|Vinoth]] did a 2 year research about Bandits to develop the script.\n\nA related genre of crime films are [[Mumbai underworld films]].\n\n===Other media===\nA Hindi novel \u092a\u0948\u0902\u0938\u0920 \u0932\u093e\u0916 \u0915\u0940 \u0921\u0915\u0948\u0924\u0940 (Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity, 1977) was written by [[Surender Mohan Pathak]]; it was translated as ''[[The 65 Lakh Heist]]''.\n\nDacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in ''[[Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties]]''.\n\nThey frequently appeared in the French language ''[[Bob Morane]]'' series of novels by [[Henri Vernes]], principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero's recurring villain, Mr. Ming.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[:Category:Indian robbers]]\n* [[Thuggee]]\n* [[Organised crime in India]]\n* [[The Deceivers]] (historical novel)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Phoolan Devi, with Marie-Therese Cuny, and Paul Rambali, ''The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman's Amazing Journey from Peasant to International Legend'' Guilford, CT: The Lyons Press, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-59228-641-6}}\n*Mala Sen, ''India's Bandit Queen: The true Story of Phoolan Devi'', HarperCollins Publishers (September 1991) {{ISBN|978-0-00-272066-3}}.\n* G.

Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21&nbsp;inches (53&nbsp;cm) wide and 18&nbsp;inches (46&nbsp;cm) high.\n\nThe tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.\n\n=== Davis Food Coop ===\nThe [http://davisfood.coop/ Davis Food Coop] is a Davis institution.

NAD83 coordinates for the campus are {{Coord|38|34|02|N|121|53|12|W}}\n\nThe college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] ceremonies. The {{convert|643|acre|km2}} and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a [[National Park Service]] publication, ''Five Views.'' The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as ''D-Q University''. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.\n\n===Other colleges===\nAn off-campus branch of [[Sacramento City College]] is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.\n\n===Public schools===\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the [[Davis Joint Unified School District]].\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for [[Alternative education|independent study]] (Davis School for Independent Study), three public [[Middle school|junior high schools]] (Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior High School|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and Frances Harper), one main high school ([[Davis Senior High School (California)|Davis Senior High School]]), one [[Alternative school|alternative high school]] (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school ([[Leonardo da Vinci High School]]). Cesar Chavez is a [[Language immersion|Spanish immersion]] school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007\u201308 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students: 1 teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|title=EdData - District Profile - Davis Joint Unified|website=www.ed-data.org|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K\u20136 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis.

writer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Detective stories |author= Philip Pullman, Nick Hardcastle|year=1998|publisher=Kingfisher Publications|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OsgjZkA_pEC&pg=PA96|isbn=0-7534-5636-2}}</ref>\n\nHe was best known for his short stories celebrating the world of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City that grew out of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. To New Yorkers of his generation, a \"Damon Runyon character\" evoked a distinctive social type from the [[Brooklyn]] or [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[demi-monde]]. The adjective \"Runyonesque\" refers to this type of character as well as to the type of situations and dialog that Runyon depicted.<ref>Webber, Elizabeth; Feinsilber, Mike (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ACB81ZeNN5sC&pg=PA479&q=runyonesque Merriam-Webster's dictionary of allusions], page 479\u2013480. {{ISBN|978-0-87779-628-2}}.</ref> He spun humorous and sentimental tales of gamblers, hustlers, actors, and gangsters, few of whom go by [[square (slang)|\"square\"]] names, preferring instead colorful monikers such as  \"Nathan Detroit\", \"Benny Southstreet\", \"Big Jule\", \"Harry the Horse\", \"Good Time Charley\", \"Dave the Dude\", or \"The Seldom Seen Kid\".  His distinctive vernacular style is known as \"Runyonese\": a mixture of formal speech and colorful slang, almost always in present tense, and always devoid of [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]]. He is credited with coining the phrase \"[[Hooray Henry]]\", a term now used in British English to describe an upper-class, loud-mouthed, arrogant twit.\n\nRunyon's fictional world is also known to the general public through the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' based on two of his stories, \"[[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]]\" and \"Blood Pressure\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ebooks-library.com/author.cfm/AuthorID/900 |title = Damon Runyon|work = Authors|publisher = The eBooks-Library|accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> The musical additionally borrows characters and story elements from a few other Runyon stories, most notably \"Pick The Winner\". The film ''[[Little Miss Marker]]'' (and its two remakes, ''[[Sorrowful Jones]]'' and the 1980 ''[[Little Miss Marker (1980 film)|Little Miss Marker]]'') grew from his short story of the same name.\n\nRunyon was also a well-known newspaper reporter, covering sports and general news for decades for various publications and syndicates owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Already famous for his fiction, he wrote a well-remembered \"present tense\" article on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s Presidential inauguration in 1933 for the Universal Service, a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] syndicate, which was merged with the co-owned [[International News Service]] in 1937.\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Damon Runyon House 2012-10-16 11-27-19.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Boyhood home of Damon Runyon in Manhattan, Kansas.]]\nDamon Runyon was born '''Alfred Damon Runyan''' to Alfred Lee and Elizabeth (Damon) Runyan.<ref>Maxine Block, editor. \"Current Biography, 1942 edition.\" H.H. Wilson, 1942, p. 723.</ref> His relatives in his birthplace of [[Manhattan, Kansas]] included several newspapermen.<ref name=house/> His grandfather was a newspaper printer from [[New Jersey]] who had relocated to Manhattan, Kansas in 1855, and his father was editor of his own newspaper in the town. In 1882 Runyon's father was forced to sell his newspaper, and the family moved westward. The family eventually settled in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] in 1887, where Runyon spent the rest of his youth. By most accounts, he attended school only through the fourth grade.<ref>\"The Press: Hand Me My Kady\". ''Time'' magazine, December 23, 1946, n.p.</ref> He began to work in the newspaper trade under his father in Pueblo. In present-day Pueblo, Runyon Field, the Damon Runyon Repertory Theater Company, and [[Runyon Lake]] are named in his honor.\n\nIn 1898, when still in his teens, Runyon enlisted in the U.S. Army to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. While in the service, he was assigned to write for the ''Manila Freedom'' and ''Soldier's Letter''.\n[[File:Runyon-Selective-Service-Registration-1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Runyon's World War I draft registration (September 1918)]]\n\nAfter his military service, he worked for various Colorado newspapers, beginning in Pueblo. His first job as a reporter was in September 1900, when he was hired by the ''Pueblo Star'';<ref>\"The Press: Broadway Columnist.\" ''Time'' magazine, September 30, 1940, n.p.</ref> he then worked in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] area during the first decade of the 1900s: at the ''Denver Daily News'', he served as \"sporting editor\" (what would today be called \"sports editor\") and then worked as a staff writer. His expertise was in covering the semi-professional teams in Colorado; he even briefly managed a semi-pro team in Trinidad, Colorado.<ref>\"An All-Star Team Picked by A.D. Runyon.\" ''Denver Daily News'', September 15, 1907, p. S2.</ref> At one of the newspapers where he worked, the spelling of his last name was changed from \"Runyan\" to \"Runyon\", a change he let stand.\n\nAfter a notable failure in trying to organize a [[Colorado]] [[minor league baseball|minor baseball league]], which lasted less than a week,<ref>Robert Phipps. \"Long Evening Kills League.\" ''Omaha World Herald'', December 21, 1946, p. 7</ref> Runyon moved to New York City in 1910. In his first New York byline, the ''American'' editor dropped the \"Alfred\" and the name \"Damon Runyon\" appeared for the first time. For the next ten years he covered the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] and professional boxing for the ''[[New York American]]''.\n\nHe was the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst newspapers']] baseball columnist for many years, beginning in 1911, and his knack for spotting the eccentric and the unusual, on the field or in the stands, is credited with revolutionizing the way baseball was covered. Perhaps as confirmation, Runyon was inducted into the writers' wing (the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]]) of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1967. He is also a member of the [[International Boxing Hall Of Fame]] and is known for dubbing heavyweight champion [[James J. Braddock]], the \"[[Cinderella Man]]\". Runyon frequently contributed sports poems to the ''American'' on boxing and baseball themes, and also wrote numerous short stories and essays. \n{{Quote box |width=320px |align=left|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote =<poem>\nIf I have all the tears that are shed on Broadway by guys in love, I will have enough salt water to start an opposition ocean to the Atlantic and Pacific, with enough left over to run the Great Salt Lake out of business. But I wish to say I never shed any of these tears personally, because I am never in love, and furthermore, barring a bad break, I never expect to be in love, for the way I look at it love is strictly the old phedinkus, and I tell the little guy as much.\n</poem>\n|source = from \"Tobias the Terrible\",<br> collected in ''More than Somewhat'' (1937)}} \nOne year, while covering spring training in [[Texas]], he met [[Pancho Villa]] in a bar and later accompanied the unsuccessful American expedition into [[Mexico]] searching for Villa. It was while he was in Mexico that he met the young girl whom he eventually married.\n\nGambling, particularly on [[craps]] or horse races, was a common theme of Runyon's works, and he was a notorious gambler himself. One of his paraphrases from a well-known line in [[Ecclesiastes]] ran: \"The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that's how the smart money bets.\"\n\nA heavy drinker as a young man, he seems to have quit drinking soon after arriving in New York, after his drinking nearly cost him the courtship of the woman who became his first wife, Ellen Egan. He remained a heavy smoker.\n\nHis best friend was mobster accountant [[Otto Berman]], and he incorporated Berman into several of his stories under the alias \"Regret, the horse player\". When Berman was killed in a hit on Berman's boss, [[Dutch Schultz]], Runyon quickly assumed the role of damage control for his deceased friend, correcting erroneous press releases (including one that stated Berman was one of Schultz's gunmen, to which Runyon replied, \"Otto would have been as effective a bodyguard as a two-year-old.\").\n\n[[File:The Family Plot of Damon Runyon in Woodlawn Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The family plot of Damon Runyon in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]Runyon's marriage to Ellen Egan produced two children (Mary and Damon, Jr.), but broke up in 1928 over rumors that Runyon had become infatuated with Patrice Amati del Grande, a Mexican woman he had first met while covering the Pancho Villa raids in 1916 and discovered once again in New York, when she called the ''American'' seeking him out. Runyon had promised her in Mexico that if she would complete the education he paid for her, he would find her a dancing job in New York. She became his companion after he separated from his wife. After Ellen Runyon's death, Runyon and del Grande married on July 7, 1932;<ref>New York, New York, Marriage Index 1866-1937</ref> that marriage ended in 1946 when she left him for a younger man.\n\nRunyon died in New York City from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in late 1946, at age 66. His body was cremated, and his ashes were illegally scattered from a [[DC-3]] airplane over Broadway in [[Manhattan]] by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] on December 18, 1946.<ref>''Eddie Rickenbacker: An American Hero in the Twentieth Century'', by W.

Henry]], neatly constructed with professionally wrought endings, but their distinction lay in the manner of their telling, as the author invented a peculiar argot for his characters to speak.  Runyon almost totally avoids the past tense (English humourist [[E.C. Bentley]] thought there was only one instance, and was willing to \"lay plenty of 6 to 5 that it is nothing but a misprint\"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 11</ref> but \"was\" appears in the short stories \"The Lily of St Pierre\"<ref name=\"Broadway, Pan Books 1975, p. 116\">''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 116</ref> and \"A Piece of Pie\";<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 536</ref> \"had\" appears in \"The Lily of St Pierre\",<ref name=\"Broadway, Pan Books 1975, p. 116\"/> \"Undertaker Song\"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 258</ref> and \"Bloodhounds of Broadway\"<ref>''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 85</ref>), and makes little use of the future tense, using the present for both. He also avoided the conditional, using instead the future indicative in situations that would normally require conditional. An example: \"Now most any doll on Broadway will be very glad indeed to have Handsome Jack Madigan give her a tumble\" (''Guys and Dolls'', \"Social error\"). [[E. C. Bentley]]<ref>Introduction to ''More Than Somewhat'', included in omnibus volume ''Runyon on Broadway'' (1950), Constable</ref> comments that \"there is a sort of ungrammatical purity about it [Runyon's resolute avoidance of the past tense], an almost religious exactitude.\"  There is an homage to Runyon that makes use of this peculiarity (\"[[Chronic Offender]]\" by [[Spider Robinson]]) which involves a time machine and a man going by the name \"Harry the Horse\".\n\nHe uses many slang terms (which go unexplained in his stories), such as:\n\n* pineapple = pineapple [[grenade]]\n* roscoe/john roscoe/the old equalizer/that thing = gun\n* shiv = knife\n* noggin = head\n* snoot = nose\n\nThere are many recurring composite phrases such as:\n\n* ever-loving wife (occasionally \"ever-loving doll\")\n* more than somewhat (or \"no little, and quite some\"); this phrase was so typical that it was used as the title of one of his short story collections\n* loathe and despise\n* one and all\n\n[[E.

Bentley]] notes<ref>Introduction to ''Furthermore'', included in omnibus volume ''Runyon on Broadway'' (1950), Constable.</ref> that Runyon's \"telling use of the recurrent phrase and fixed epithet\" demonstrates a debt to [[Homer]].\n\nRunyon's stories also employ occasional rhyming slang, similar to the [[cockney slang|cockney]] variety but native to New York (e.g.: \"Miss Missouri Martin makes the following crack one night to her: 'Well, I do not see any Simple Simon on your lean and linger.' This is Miss Missouri Martin's way of saying she sees no diamond on Miss Billy Perry's finger.\" (from \"Romance in the Roaring Forties\")).\n\nThe comic effect of his style results partly from the juxtaposition of broad slang with mock-pomposity. Women, when not \"dolls\", \"Judies\", \"pancakes\", \"tomatoes\", or \"broads\", may be \"characters of a female nature\", for example. He typically avoided contractions such as \"don't\" in the example above, which also contributes significantly to the humorously pompous effect. In one sequence, a gangster tells another character to do as he is told, or else \"find another world in which to live\".\n\nRunyon's short stories are told in the first person by a protagonist who is never named, and whose role is unclear; he knows many gangsters and does not appear to have a job, but he does not admit to any criminal involvement, and seems to be largely a bystander.  He describes himself as \"being known to one and all as a guy who is just around\".<ref name=\"rob\">''Runyon on Broadway'', Pan Books, 1975, p. 12</ref>  The Damon Runyon Theatre dramatized 52 of Runyon's works in 1949, and for these the protagonist was given the name \"Broadway\", although it was admitted that this was not his real name, much in the way \"Harry the Horse\" and \"Sorrowful Jones\" are aliases.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/OTRR_Damon_Runyon_Singles] Damon Runyon Theater</ref>\n\n==Literary works==\n\n===Books===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*''The Tents of Trouble'' (poems; 1911)\n*''Rhymes of the Firing Line'' (poems; 1912)\n*''Guys and Dolls'' (1932)\n*''Damon Runyon's Blue Plate Special'' (1934)\n*''Money From Home'' (1935)\n*''More Than Somewhat'' (1937)\n*''Furthermore'' (1938)\n*''Take It Easy'' (1938)\n*''My Wife Ethel'' (1939)\n*''My Old Man'' (1939)\n*''The Best of Runyon'' (1940)\n*''A Slight Case of Murder'' (play; with Howard Lindsay, 1940)\n*''Damon Runyon Favorites'' (1942)\n*''Capt.

At this time, Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ([[The Numbers Band]]). They met [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] around 1970, a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt.<ref name=thoughts /> Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band, introducing them to material like the pamphlet \"Jocko Homo Heavenbound\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fw_alden.tripod.com/id1.html |title=Jocko-Homo Heavenbound |website=F.

Devo returned to perform in the Student Governance Center (featured prominently in the film) at the 1974 Creative Arts Festival with a lineup including the Casale brothers, Bob Lewis, Mark Mothersbaugh, and [[Jim Mothersbaugh]] on drums.\n\nThe band continued to perform, generally as a quartet, but with a fluid lineup including Mark's brothers [[Bob Mothersbaugh]] and Jim Mothersbaugh. Bob played electric guitar, and Jim provided percussion using a set of home-made [[electronic drum]]s.

In concert, Devo would often perform in the guise of [[Characters in Devo music videos|theatrical characters]], such as [[Booji Boy]] and the Chinaman. Live concerts from this period were often confrontational, and would remain so until 1977.

Lewis then filed an action in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]], alleging theft of intellectual property. During discovery, Lewis produced articles, promotional materials, documentary evidence and an interview<ref name=lewisinterview/> recorded at the [[Akron Art Museum]] following the premiere of ''In the Beginning was the End'' in which Mothersbaugh and other band members credited Lewis with developing the theory of de-evolution. The band quickly settled for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe band followed up with ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' in 1979, which moved the band more towards electronic instrumentation. While not as successful as their first album, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs \"Blockhead\" and \"The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize\" {{sic}}, as well as a cover of the [[Johnny Rivers]] hit \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\". \"Secret Agent Man\" had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo's first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979, Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' in 1979, performing \"Blockhead\", \"Secret Agent Man\", \"Uncontrollable Urge\", and \"Mongoloid\". Also in 1979, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]]\u2014in conjunction with the LA radio station [[KROQ-FM]]\u2014released ''Devotees'', a tribute album.

They appeared as Dove in the 1980 [[televangelism]] spoof film ''[[Pray TV]]''. They also recorded two albums of their own songs as elevator music for their fan club, Club Devo, released on cassette in 1981 and 1984. These were later re-released on the album ''[[E-Z Listening Disc]]'' (1987), with all but two of the original Club Devo songs. These songs were often played as house music before Devo concerts.\n\nDevo gained a new level of visibility with 1980's ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]''. This album included their best-known hit, \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", which quickly became a [[Top 40]] hit. The album moved to an almost completely electronic sound, with the exception of acoustic drums and Bob Mothersbaugh's guitar. The tour for ''Freedom of Choice'' was ambitious for the band, including dates in Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huboon.com/1980.html |first=Mike |last=Ziegler |title=Devo Live Guide 1980 |website=Huboon.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> The band used a minimalist set including large custom light boxes which could be laid on their back to form a second, smaller stage during the second half of the set. Other popular songs from ''Freedom of Choice'' were \"[[Girl U Want]]\", the [[Freedom of Choice (song)|title-track]], and \"Gates of Steel\". The band released popular music videos for \"Whip It\" and \"Girl U Want\". Devo made two appearances on the TV show ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' in 1980, as well as on ''Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and other shows. The band members often wore red, terraced [[Energy dome]] hats as part of its stage outfit. The dome was first worn during the band's ''Freedom of Choice'' campaign of 1980. It reappeared in the 1981, 1982, and 1988 tours, as well as in most of their performances since 1997.\n\nIn August 1981, the band's ''[[DEV-O Live]]'' EP spent [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s#1981 (Kent Music Report)|three weeks at the top of the Australian charts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1981 |title=Australian Singles chart for 1981 |date=November 5, 2010 |first=Mark |last=Gibson |website=Australian Music History |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> In 1982, they toured Australia and appeared on the TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''. Devo enjoyed continued popularity in Australia, where the nationally broadcast 1970s\u20131980s pop TV show ''Countdown'' was one of the first programs in the world to broadcast their video clips. They were given consistent radio support by Sydney-based non-commercial rock station [[Triple J|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and Brisbane-based independent community station Triple Zed ([[4ZZZ]]), two of the first rock stations outside America to play their recordings. The late-night music program ''Nightmoves'' aired ''The Truth About De-Evolution''.\n\n===1980s hits===\nIn 1981, Devo contributed a cover of \"[[Working in the Coal Mine]]\", recorded during the ''Freedom of Choice'' sessions, to the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''. They offered the song to be used in the film when Warner Bros. refused to include it on the album. Warner then included it as an independent bonus single accompanying their 1981 release, ''[[New Traditionalists]]''. For this album Devo wore self-described \"Utopian Boy Scout uniforms\" topped with a \"New Traditionalist Pomp\"\u2014a plastic half-wig modeled on the hairstyle of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Among the singles from the album was \"[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]\", written as a reaction to their new-found fame from \"Whip It\" and seen as a response to new fans who had misinterpreted the message behind the hit song. The album's accompanying tour featured the band performing an intensely physical show with treadmills and a large Greek temple set. That same year they served as [[Toni Basil]]'s backing band on [[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|''Word of Mouth'']], her debut album, which included versions of three Devo songs, recorded with Basil singing lead.<ref name=\"Top One Hit Wonders: Mickey\">{{cite web |title=Mickey \u2013 Toni Basil |url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/mickey-toni-basil/ |website=Top One Hit Wonders |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Gruber: Mickey\">{{cite web |last=Gruber |first=Xaque |title='Mickey' Turns 30: A Closer Look at the One and Only Toni Basil |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xaque-gruber/toni-basil-mickey-anniversary_b_2080971.html |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]'' followed in 1982. Produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]], the album featured a darker, more sinister sound than its predecessors. According to Gerald Casale, the album's sound was inspired by reviewers alternately describing them as both \"[[Fascism|fascists]]\" and \"[[clown]]s.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-11426-lsdevo-is-like-the-house-band-on-the-titanicrs.html |title=Devo Is Like the House Band on the Titanic |first=Alan |last=Sculley |date=June 30, 2010 |newspaper=[[Shepherd Express]] |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref> The album's tour featured the band performing seven songs in front of a 12-foot high rear-projection screen with synchronized video, an image recreated using [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects in the album's accompanying music videos. Devo also contributed two songs, \"[[Theme from Doctor Detroit]]\" and \"Luv-Luv\" to the 1983 [[Dan Aykroyd]] film ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'', and produced a music video for \"Theme from Doctor Detroit\" featuring clips from the film with live action segments.\n\nDevo released their sixth album, ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'', in 1984 to poor reviews. The album has been criticized for its overuse of the [[Fairlight CMI]] digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]] synthesizer and weak songwriting. However, the band's cover of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" and the accompanying music video received some praise. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''Shout'', Warner Bros. dropped Devo. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, Alan Myers left the band,<ref name=Myers /> causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a ''Shout'' video LP, as well as a tour. In the interim, Mark Mothersbaugh began composing music for the TV show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and released an elaborately packaged solo [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], ''[[Muzik for Insomniaks, Volume 1 and Volume 2|Musik for Insomniaks]]'', which was later expanded and released as two [[Compact disc|CD]]s in 1988.\n\n===Break-up===\nIn 1987, Devo re-formed with former [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] drummer David Kendrick to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film ''[[Slaughterhouse Rock]]'', starring [[Toni Basil]]. The band released the album ''[[Total Devo]]'' in 1988, on [[Enigma Records]]. This album included two songs used in the ''Slaughterhouse Rock'' soundtrack. The song \"Baby Doll\" was used that same year in the comedy film ''[[Tapeheads]]'', with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared. Devo followed this up with a world tour, and released the live album ''[[Now It Can Be Told: DEVO at the Palace]]''. However, ''Total Devo'' was not a commercial success and received poor critical reviews.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/total-devo-19880811 |title=Total Devo |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |date=August 11, 1988 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_spawn_of_devo_the_visiting_kids |title=The Spawn of Devo: Visiting Kids |date=26 April 2012 |website=Dangerousminds.net |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> The band featured Mark's then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob's daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Their record was produced by Bob Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, and Mark also co-wrote some of the songs. Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Rockula]]'', as well as on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. A promotional video was filmed for the song \"Trilobites\".\n\nIn 1990, ''[[Smooth Noodle Maps]]'', Devo's last album for twenty years, was released. It too was a critical and commercial failure which, along with its two singles \"Stuck in a Loop\" and \"Post Post-Modern Man\", hold the distinction of being Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/smooth-noodle-maps-mw0000689854 |title=Devo: Smooth Noodle Maps |website=AllMusic |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}</ref> Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game \"Devo Presents [[Adventures of the Smart Patrol]], \"Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, and it was kind of at that point, We were watching ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' on the bus and said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.' And we just said, 'Things have to change.' So we kind of agreed from there that we wouldn't do live shows anymore.\" Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974\u20131977\u2014''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume One]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]'' (1991)\u2014were released on [[Rykodisc]], as well as an album of early live recordings, ''[[DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years]]''.\n\nFollowing the split, Mark Mothersbaugh established [[Mutato Muzika]], a commercial music production studio, along with Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/are-you-not-devo-you-are-mutato-2151061 |title=Are you not Devo?

Mothersbaugh has had considerable success writing and producing music for television programs, including ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and  ''[[Rugrats]]'', video games, cartoons, and films, where he worked alongside director [[Wes Anderson]]. David Kendrick also worked at Mutato for a period during the early 1990s. Gerald Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]]. In the wake of Devo's dissolution, Bob Mothersbaugh attempted to start a solo career with The Bob I Band, recording an album that was never released.

The band performed on part of the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour in the rotating Mystery Spot. On these tours and most subsequent tours, Devo performed a set-list mostly composed of material from between 1978 and 1982, ignoring their Enigma Records-era material. Also in 1996, Devo released a multimedia CD-ROM [[adventure game]], ''[[Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'' with [[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]]. The game was not a success, but the Lollapalooza tour was received well enough to allow Devo to return in 1997 as a headliner. Devo performed sporadically from 1997 onwards.\n\nThe ''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]'' era outtakes \"Faster and Faster\" and \"One Dumb Thing,\" as well as the ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'' era outtake \"Modern Life,\" were restored, completed and used in the video game ''[[Interstate '82]]'', developed by [[Activision]] and released in 1999. Also that year, Devo performed the theme song to the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Rocket Power]]'', using the alias \"The Wipeouters.\" In 2001, the Wipeouters released an album of [[surf rock]] material, titled ''P'Twaaang!!!''.\n\nIn 2005, Devo recorded a new version of \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\" to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted. During an interview with the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', Gerald Casale said, \"It's just aesthetically offensive. It's got everything a commercial that turns people off has.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Dearmore |first=Kelly |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-08-17/music/jihad-jerry/ |title=Jihad Jerry |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> The song \"[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]\" was also used in a re-recorded form for an ad for [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores. Due to rights issues with their back catalog, Devo has re-recorded songs for films and ads.\n\nIn 2005, Gerald Casale announced his \"solo\" project, [[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers]] (the Evildoers themselves including the other members of Devo), and released the first EP, ''[[Army Girls Gone Wild]]'' in 2006. A full-length album, ''[[Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers#Mine Is Not a Holy War (2006)|Mine Is Not a Holy War]]'', was released on September 12, 2006, after a several-month delay. It featured mostly new material, plus re-recordings of four obscure Devo songs: \"I Need a Chick\" and \"I Been Refused\" (from ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]''), \"Find Out\" (which appeared on the single and EP of \"[[Peek-a-Boo!]]\" in 1982), and \"Beehive\" (which was recorded by the band in 1974, at which point it was apparently abandoned with the exception of one appearance at a special show in 2001).

A band of child performers was assembled and re-recorded Devo songs.

He later traveled to the Middle East and met architect Robert Landsman. Their meeting and his time abroad spurred Chihuly to return to his studies.

After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in a 1979 [[bodysurfing]] accident. No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying \"Once I stepped back, I liked the view,\" and pointed out that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems faster. Chihuly describes his role as \"more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor.\" ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' reporter Erin Glass wrote that she \"wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the very successful entrepreneur Chihuly, whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' as $29 million.\"<ref name=\"San Diego Union-Tribune\">{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk|title='Chihuly' a site-specific explosion of art at Salk|archivedate=30 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730204709/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk/|deadurl=yes|author=Glass, Erin|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=22 April 2010|df=}}</ref> Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''{{vanchor|Chihuly Over Venice}}.''

One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2017, the organization chose to host two international competitions, one in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] and another in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], each a week apart. From 2018 to 2020, it will be held in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] instead of [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].\n\nFIRST has many robotics programs for students in grades K-12, including FLL JR.

In the [[United States]], after the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges. \nDerivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being [[stock]]s (i.e., equities or shares) and [[debt]] (i.e., [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and mortgages).<ref name=\"SimkovicSecret\" /> The oldest example of a derivative in history is thought to be a contract transaction of [[olive]]s, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher [[Thales]], and attested to by [[Aristotle]], who made a profit in the exchange.<ref>{{cite book |first1=George |last1=Crawford |first2=Bidyut |last2=Sen |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NIIVeirctosC&pg=PA7 |title=Derivatives for Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year=1996 |isbn=9780471129943 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>  [[Bucket shop (stock market)|Bucket shops]], outlawed a century ago, are a more recent historical example.\n\n==Basics==\nDerivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties' contractual obligations, and the [[notional amount]]) under which payments are to be made between the parties.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{cite book |last= [[Mark Rubinstein]] |title= Rubinstein on Derivatves|year=1999|publisher=Risk Books |isbn=1-899332-53-7}}</ref>  The assets include [[Commodity|commodities]], stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm's capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm's assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.\n\nFrom the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows, that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in the underlying asset is attached to the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal =Working Paper|pages=10|ssrn=2511541}}</ref> The underlying asset does not have to be acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows derivative designers to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\"/>\n\nThere are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivatives such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]] that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and [[Exchange-traded derivative contract|exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) that are traded through specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges.\n\nDerivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the [[Dojima Rice Exchange]] since the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Rice_FT\">{{cite news\n| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9f45d80-6922-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html\n| date = December 10, 2005\n| title = Sensitive politics over Japan's staple crop delays rice futures plan\n|author1=Kaori Suzuki |author2=David Turner | work = [[The Financial Times]].\n| accessdate = October 23, 2010\n}}</ref> Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as [[forward contract|forward]], [[option (finance)|option]], [[swap (finance)|swap]]); the type of underlying asset (such as [[equity derivative]]s, [[foreign exchange derivative]]s, [[interest rate derivative]]s, commodity derivatives, or [[credit derivative]]s); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]); and their pay-off profile.\n\nDerivatives may broadly be categorized as \"lock\" or \"option\" products. Lock products (such as [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, [[futures contract|futures]], or forwards) obligate the contractual parties to the terms over the life of the contract. [[Option (finance)|Option]] products (such as [[interest rate swaps]]) provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation to enter the contract under the terms specified.\n\nDerivatives can be used either for risk management (i.e. to \"hedge\" by providing offsetting compensation in case of an undesired event, a kind of \"insurance\") or for speculation (i.e. making a financial \"bet\"). This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.\n\nAlong with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010. The Act delegated many rule-making details of regulatory oversight to the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and those details are not finalized nor fully implemented as of late 2012.\n\n==Size of market==\nTo give an idea of the size of the derivative market, ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that as of June 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market amounted to approximately $700 trillion, and the size of the market traded on exchanges totaled an additional $83 trillion.<ref>{{cite news | title = Clear and Present Danger; Centrally cleared derivatives.(clearing houses) | work = The Economist | date = April 12, 2012  | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21552217  | publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd.{{Subscription required}} }}</ref>  For the fourth quarter 2017 the [[European Securities and Markets Authority|European Securities Market Authority]] estimated the size of European [[derivatives market]] at a size of \u20ac660 trillion with 74 million outstanding contracts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-data-analysis-values-eu-derivatives-market-%E2%82%AC660-trillion-central-clearing|title=ESMA data analysis values EU derivatives market at \u20ac660 trillion with central clearing increasing significantly|website=www.esma.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref> \n\nHowever, these are \"notional\" values, and some economists say that this value greatly exaggerates the market value and the true credit risk faced by the parties involved.

Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e., \"[[in the money]]\") or a liability (i.e., \"[[out of the money]]\") at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its [[counterparty]] and is interested in protecting itself in an [[event of default]].\n\nOption products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection ([[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]) over a given time period ([[Option time value|time value]]). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value).  Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e., if it is \"in the money\") or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e., if the option is \"out of the money\").\n\n===Hedging===\n{{Main article|Hedge (finance)}}\n\nDerivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a [[wheat]] farmer and a [[miller]] could sign a [[futures contract]] to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will [[Revocation|renege]] on the contract. Although a third party, called a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]], insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.\n\nFrom another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.\n\nHedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has [[coupon (bond)|coupon payments]], a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.\n[[File:Chicago bot.jpg|right|250px|right|thumb|Derivatives traders at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]]]\n\nDerivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses.<ref>Peterson, Sam (2010), [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/theres-a-derivative-in-your-cereal/60582 \"There's a Derivative in Your Cereal\"], ''The Atlantic''.</ref> For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.<ref>Chisolm, Derivatives Demystified (Wiley 2004)</ref> The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a [[forward rate agreement]] (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a [[notional amount]] of money.<ref>Chisolm, ''Derivatives Demystified'' (Wiley 2004) Notional sum means there is no actual principal.</ref> If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.\n\n===Speculation and arbitrage===\nDerivatives can be used to acquire risk, rather than to hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the underlying asset, betting that the party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is less.\n\nIndividuals and institutions may also look for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a futures contract to sell the asset.\n\nSpeculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when [[Nick Leeson]], a trader at [[Barings Bank]], made poor and unauthorized investments in futures contracts. Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank's management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the [[Kobe earthquake]], Leeson incurred a $1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.<ref name=\"lee\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/375259.stm \"How Leeson broke the bank\"], ''BBC Economy''</ref>\n\n===Proportion used for hedging and speculation===\nThe true proportion of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sergey Chernenko|author2=Michael Faulkender|title=The Two Sides of Derivatives Usage: Hedging and Speculating with Interest Rate Swaps|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1727\u20131754|doi=10.1017/S0022109011000391|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.7302&rep=rep1&type=pdf}}</ref> but it appears to be relatively small.<ref>Knowledge@Wharton (2012).

Products such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]], [[forward rate agreement]]s, [[exotic option]]s \u2013 and other [[exotic derivative]]s \u2013 are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [[hedge fund]]s.  Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.\n\nAccording to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995,<ref name=BIS2007>{{cite report |author1=Ryan Stever |author2=Christian Upper |author3=Goetz von Peter |title= BIS Quarterly Review |publisher=Bank for International Settlements |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0712.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> reported that the \"[[gross market value]], which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices,&nbsp;... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24).\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> [[Position (finance)|Positions]] in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004. The total outstanding notional amount is US$708 trillion (as of June 2011).<ref name=\"afgh\">BIS survey: The [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) semi-annual [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.pdf OTC derivatives market report], for end of June 2008, showed US$683.7 trillion total [[notional amount]]s outstanding of OTC derivatives with a [[gross market value]] of US$20 trillion. ''See also [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.htm Prior Period Regular OTC Derivatives Market Statistics]''.</ref>  Of this total notional amount, 67% are [[interest rate derivative|interest rate contracts]], 8% are [[Credit default swap|credit default swaps (CDS)]], 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other.  Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty risk]], like an ordinary [[contract]], since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.\n\n* '''[[Exchange-traded derivative contract|Exchange-traded derivatives]]''' (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange.<ref name=\"hull\"/> A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes [[initial margin]] from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largest<ref name=\"foweek\">''Futures and Options Week'': According to figures published in F&O Week October 10, 2005. See also [http://www.fow.com FOW Website].</ref> derivatives exchanges (by number of transactions) are the [[Korea Exchange]] (which lists [[KOSPI]] Index Futures & Options), [[Eurex]] (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate & index products), and [[CME Group]] (made up of the 2007 merger of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and the 2008 acquisition of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]). According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world's derivatives exchanges totaled USD 344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> that \"derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion.\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" />\n\n===Common derivative contract===\nSome of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:\n# [[Forward contract|Forwards]]: A tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.\n# [[Futures contract|Futures]]: are [[contract]]s to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.\n# [[Option (finance)|Options]] are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a [[call option]]) or sell (in the case of a [[put option]]) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [[strike price]], and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a [[European option]], the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an [[American option]], the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: [[call option]] and [[put option]]. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. Similarly, the buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.\n# [[Binary option]]s are contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.\n# [[Warrant (finance)|Warrants]]: Apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. These are generally traded over the counter.\n# [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, [[commodities exchange]], stocks or other assets. Another term which is commonly associated with ''swap'' is ''[[swaption]]'', a term for what is basically an option on the forward swap. Similar to call and put options, swaptions are of two kinds: ''receiver'' and ''payer''. In the case of a receiver swaption there is an option wherein one can receive fixed and pay floating; in the case of a payer swaption one has the option to pay fixed and receive floating.\n::Swaps can basically be categorized into two types: \n::*[[Interest rate swap]]: These basically necessitate swapping only interest associated cash flows in the same currency, between two parties.\n::*[[Currency swap]]: In this kind of swapping, the cash flow between the two parties includes both principal and interest. Also, the money which is being swapped is in different currency for both parties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial Markets: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}</ref>\nSome common examples of these derivatives are the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |UNDERLYING\n! colspan=\"5\" |CONTRACT TYPES\n|-\n!

An \"asset-backed security\" is used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets\u2014including collateralized debt obligations and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (Example: \"The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs\".<ref name=\"Securitization\">{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=2013|volume=88|pages=213|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1924831}}</ref>(source: {{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis| title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis|url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf| work=August 2007 |publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=July 13, 2013}})<br>\u2014and sometimes for a particular type of that security\u2014one backed by consumer loans (example: \"As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products\u2014car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others\u2014are called ABS. source {{cite web|last=Vink |first= Dennis| title= ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis| url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007| publisher= Munich Personal RePEc Archive |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}, <br>see also {{cite web|title=What are Asset-Backed Securities? |url= http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&subcatid=16&id=10#sthash.roSaSia3.dpuf| publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=July 13, 2013|quote=Asset-backed securities, called ABS, are bonds or notes backed by financial assets.

The CDO is \"sliced\" into [[tranche|\"tranches\"]], which \"catch\" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Koehler| first1=Christian| title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk |journal=Working Paper| pages=17|ssrn= 2511541}}</ref>  If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most \"junior\" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, [[coupon (bond)|coupon]] payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches paying the lowest and the lowest tranches paying the highest rates to compensate for higher [[default risk]].  As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as \"super senior\"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.<ref name=\"Lemke 2014\">Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nSeparate [[Special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]]\u2014rather than the parent [[investment bank]]\u2014issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration called \"[[CDO-Squared]]\" or the \"CDOs of CDOs\".<ref name=\"Lemke 2014\"/> \nIn the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,<ref>Bethany McLean and [[Joe Nocera]], ''All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis'', Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.120</ref> but by 2006\u20132007\u2014when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level ([[Credit ratings#Corporate credit ratings|BBB or A]]) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually non-prime mortgages.<ref name=\"FCIR-p127\">[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf \"Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States\"], a.k.a. \"The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report\", p.127</ref> These CDOs have been called \"the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain\" for nonprime mortgages,<ref name=\"FCIR-130\">''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.130</ref> and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make non-prime loans<ref name=\"FCIR-133\">''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.133</ref> leading up to the 2007-9 [[subprime mortgage crisis]].\n\n===Credit default swap===\nA '''credit default swap''' ('''CDS''') is a [[Swap (finance)|financial swap]] agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan [[Default (finance)|default]] (by the debtor) or other [[credit event]]. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS \"fee\" or \"spread\") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults.<ref name=\"SimkovicSecret\" /> It was invented by [[Blythe Masters]]  from [[J.P. Morgan & Co.|JP Morgan]] in 1994.\nIn the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the [[face value]] of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan.<ref name=\"LBO CDS\" />  However, anyone with sufficient collateral to trade with a bank or hedge fund can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct [[insurable interest]] in the loan (these are called \"naked\" CDSs).

This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the [[value date]] where the [[Security (finance)|securities]] themselves are exchanged.\n\nThe [[forward price]] of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the [[spot price]], which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the [[spot date]]. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the [[forward premium]] or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], or loss, by the purchasing party. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of [[speculation]], or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.\n\nA closely related contract is a [[futures contract]]; they [[Futures contract#Futures versus forwards|differ in certain respects]]. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets.<ref>[[Wikinvest:Forward Contract|Forward Contract on Wikinvest]]</ref> Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or \"true-ups\" in margin requirements like futures\u2014such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}  In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain \"trigger\" events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually).\n\n===Futures===\nIn [[finance]], a 'futures contract' (more colloquially, '''futures''') is a standardized [[contract]] between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the ''futures price'') with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the ''delivery date'', making it a derivative product (i.e. a financial product that is derived from an underlying asset). The contracts are negotiated at a [[futures exchange]], which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the \"buyer\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Long (finance)|long]]\", and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the \"seller\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Short (finance)|short]]\".\n\nWhile the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the [[Futures contract#Margin|margin]]. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as \"marking to market\". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the [[spot price|spot value]] (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the \"caller\".\n\nA closely related contract is a [[forward contract]]. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.\nUnlike an [[option (finance)|option]], both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures [[position (finance)|position]] can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss..\n\n===Mortgage-backed securities===\nA '''mortgage-backed security''' ('''MBS''') is a [[asset-backed security]] that is secured by a [[mortgage]], or more commonly a collection (\"pool\") of sometimes hundreds of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that \"[[securitization|securitizes]]\", or packages, the loans together into a security that can be sold to investors.<ref name=\"Securitization\" />The mortgages of an MBS may be [[Residential mortgage-backed security|residential]] or [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial]], depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s like [[Fannie Mae]] or [[Freddie Mac]], or they can be \"private-label\", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as \"pass-through\", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).<ref>Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 4 and 5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref>\n\nThe shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as [[tranche]]s (French for \"slices\"), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranches\u2014especially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranches\u2014of an MBS are/were often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations.<ref>Josh Clark, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/mortgage-backed-security.htm \"How can mortgage-backed securities bring down the U.S. economy?\"], How Stuff Works</ref> These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2006\u20132008\n.\nThe total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and most other fixed-income securities, the [[Debt|principal]] in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS's \"factor\", the percentage of the original \"face\" that remains to be repaid.\n\n===Options===\nIn [[finance]], an '''option''' is a contract which gives the ''buyer'' (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [[underlying]] asset or [[financial instrument|instrument]] at a specified [[strike price]] on or before a specified [[expiration (options)|date]]. The ''seller'' has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction\u2014that is to sell or buy\u2014if the buyer (owner) \"exercises\" the option. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy something at a certain price is a \"[[call option]]\"; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell something at a certain price is a \"[[put option]]\". Both are commonly traded, but for clarity, the call option is more frequently discussed.\nOptions valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance. In basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:\n* The first part is the \"intrinsic value\", defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]] and the strike price of the given option.\n* The second part is the \"time value\", which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multivariable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.\n\nAlthough options valuation has been studied since the 19th century, the contemporary approach is based on the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]], which was first published in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title= Options pre-Black Scholes |url= http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last =Black |first= Fischer |first2= Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal =[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637\u2013654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}</ref>\n\nOptions contracts have been known for many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, options were issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing house at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]. Today, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as [[derivative products]] or simply derivatives.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{Citation\n|last=Brealey\n|first=Richard A.\n|author-link=Richard A.

The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the benefits in question can be the periodic interest ([[Coupon (bond)|coupon]]) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to the exchange one stream of [[cash flow]]s against another stream. These streams are called the swap's \"legs\". The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are [[Accrual|accrued]] and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a [[floating interest rate]], [[foreign exchange rate]], equity price, or commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n\nThe cash flows are calculated over a [[notional principal amount]]. Contrary to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]], the notional amount is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.\n\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th | last1=Ross |last2=Westerfield |last3=Jordan |year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding is more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, credit swaps, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s (there are many other types).\n\n==Economic function of the derivative market==\nSome of the salient economic functions of the derivative market include:\n# Prices in a structured [[derivative market]] not only replicate the discernment of the market participants about the future but also lead the prices of [[underlying]] to the professed future level. On the expiration of the [[derivative contract]], the prices of derivatives congregate with the prices of the underlying.  Therefore, derivatives are essential tools to determine both current and future prices.\n# The derivatives market reallocates risk from the people who prefer [[risk aversion]] to the people who have an appetite for risk.\n# The intrinsic nature of derivatives market associates them to the underlying [[spot market]]. Due to derivatives there is a considerable increase in trade volumes of the underlying spot market. The dominant factor behind such an escalation is increased participation by additional players who would not have otherwise participated due to absence of any procedure to transfer risk.\n# As supervision, reconnaissance of the activities of various participants becomes tremendously difficult in assorted markets; the establishment of an organized form of market becomes all the more imperative. Therefore, in the presence of an organized derivatives market, [[speculation]] can be controlled, resulting in a more meticulous environment.\n# Third parties can use publicly available derivative prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts.<ref name=\"CDS\">{{cite journal|ssrn=1632084 |author1=Michael Simkovic |author2=Benjamin Kaminetzky |title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution |publisher=Columbia Business Law Review, Vol. 2011, No. 1, p. 118, 2011 |date=August 29, 2010 |accessdate=}}</ref>\nIn a nutshell, there is a substantial increase in savings and investment in the long run due to augmented activities by derivative [[market participant]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Currency Derivatives: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Valuation==\n[[File:Total world wealth vs total world derivatives 1998-2007.gif|thumb|450px|Total world derivatives from 1998 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm |title=Bis.org |publisher=Bis.org |date=May 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> compared to total world wealth in the year 2000<ref>{{cite web | title = Launch of the WIDER study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth: 5 December 2006 | url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/ | accessdate = June 9, 2009}}</ref>]]\n\n===Market and arbitrage-free prices===\nTwo common measures of value are:\n* [[Market price]], i.e. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract\n* [[Arbitrage]]-free price, meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts (see ''[[rational pricing]]'')\n\n===Determining the market price===\nFor exchange-traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.\n\n===Determining the arbitrage-free price===\n: ''See [[List of finance topics#Derivatives pricing|List of finance topics# Derivatives pricing]].''\nThe arbitrage-free price for a derivatives contract can be complex, and there are many different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of [[financial mathematics]]. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the cost of carry (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.\n\nHowever, for options and more complex derivatives, pricing involves developing a complex pricing model: understanding the [[stochastic process]] of the price of the underlying asset is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical [[valuation of options]] is the [[Black\u2013Scholes formula]], which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock [[Option (finance)|option]] can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the [[binomial options model]].\n\nOTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price derivatives. Since these contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. Most of the model's results are input-dependent (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the pricing inputs).<ref>Boumlouka, Makrem (2009),\"Alternatives in OTC Pricing\", ''Hedge Funds Review'', Oct 30, 2009. http://www.hedgefundsreview.com/hedge-funds-review/news/1560286/otc-pricing-deal-struck-fitch-solutions-pricing-partners</ref>\nTherefore, it is common that OTC derivatives are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).\n\n==Criticisms==\nDerivatives are often subject to the following criticisms:\n\n=== Hidden tail risk ===\nAccording to [[Raghuram Rajan]], a former chief economist of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), \"...&nbsp;it may well be that the managers of these firms [investment funds] have figured out the correlations between the various instruments they hold and believe they are hedged.

However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly.

For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.\n\n===Large notional value===\nDerivatives typically have a '''large notional value'''. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses for which the investor would be unable to compensate. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis was pointed out by famed investor [[Warren Buffett]] in [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s 2002 annual report. Buffett called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator.[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)]\n\n==Financial Reform and Government Regulation==\nUnder US law and the laws of most other developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions that make them a particularly attractive legal form to extend credit.<ref name=\"Secret\">{{cite journal|ssrn=1323190 |title=Michael Simkovic, Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008. |publisher=American Bankruptcy Law Journal, Vol. 83, p. 253 |year=2009 |accessdate=}}</ref> The strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties, in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency however, can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk.

Additionally, the report said, \"[t]he [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,' according to a department spokeswoman.\"<ref>Story, Louise, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?hp \"A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives\"], ''The New York Times'', December 11, 2010 (December 12, 2010, p. A1 NY ed.). Retrieved December 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nFor legislators and committees responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities has been a nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for \"systemically significant\" institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment.<ref>Zubrod, Luke (2011). The Atlantic. \"Will the 'Cure' for Systemic Risk Kill the Economy?\" https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/will-the-cure-for-systemic-risk-kill-the-economy/240600/</ref>  \nIn this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as \"systemically significant\" whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.\n\nOver-the-counter dealing will be less common as the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] comes into effect. The law mandated the clearing of certain swaps at registered exchanges and imposed various restrictions on derivatives.

This means that a bank's obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.\n* [[Counterparty]]: The legal and financial term for the other party in a financial transaction.\n* [[Credit derivative]]: A contract that transfers [[credit risk]] from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as [[credit default swap]]s, credit linked notes and total return swaps.\n* Derivative: A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards and various combinations thereof.\n* [[Exchange-traded derivative contract]]s: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g., [[futures contract]]s and [[Option (finance)|options]]) that are transacted on an organized [[futures exchange]].\n* Gross negative fair value: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank's counter-parties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counter-parties.\n* Gross positive fair value: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counter-parties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counter-party collateral.\n* High-risk mortgage securities: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, as determined by the U.S. [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.\n* [[Notional amount]]: The nominal or [[face amount]] that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.\n* [[over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized futures exchanges.\n* [[Structured note]]s: Non-mortgage-backed [[debt securities]], whose cash flow characteristics depend on one or more indices and / or have embedded forwards or options.\n* Total risk-based capital: The sum of [[Tier 1 capital|tier 1]] plus [[tier 2 capital]]. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, perpetual preferred shareholders equity with noncumulative dividends, [[retained earnings]], and [[minority interest]]s in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of [[subordinated debt]], intermediate-term [[preferred stock]], cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank's [[Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL)|allowance for loan and lease losses]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Finance}}\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Credit derivative]]\n* [[Derivatives law]]\n* [[Equity derivative]]\n* [[Exotic derivative]]\n* [[Financial engineering]]\n* [[Foreign exchange derivative]]\n* [[Freight derivative]]\n* [[Inflation derivative]]\n* [[Interest rate derivative]]\n* [[Property derivatives]]\n* [[Weather derivative]]\n{{Colend}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2=Brown, Gregory W. |author3=Conrad, Jennifer C. |date= August 2011  |title=The Effects of Derivatives on Firm Risk and Value |journal= Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis |volume= 46 |issue=4 |pages=967\u2013999 |doi= 10.1017/s0022109011000275|ssrn = 1550942  |author1= S\u00f6hnke M.

It asserts that a [[monarch]] is subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of [[God]]. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the [[aristocracy]], or any other [[estate of the realm]]. It implies that only God can judge an unjust king and that any attempt to depose, dethrone or restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase \"[[by the Grace of God]]\", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch.\n\n== Origins ==\n\nIn the pagan world,{{Clarify|date=July 2017}} kings were often seen as either ruling with the backing of heavenly powers or perhaps even being divine beings themselves. However, the Christian notion of a divine right of kings is traced to a story found in [[1 Samuel]], where the prophet [[Samuel]] anoints [[Saul]] and then [[David]] as ''[[mashiach]]'' or king over Israel. The anointing is to such an effect that the monarch became inviolable, so that even when Saul sought to kill David, David would not raise his hand against him because \"he was the Lord's anointed\".\n\n[[Adomnan of Iona]] is one of the earliest Christian proponents of this concept of kings ruling with divine right. He wrote of the Irish King [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]]'s assassination and claimed that divine punishment fell on his assassin for the act of violating the monarch. Adomnan also recorded a story about Saint [[Columba]] supposedly being visited by an angel carrying a glass book, who told him to ordain [[Aedan mac Gabrain]] as King of [[Dal Riata]]. Columba initially refused, and  the angel answered by whipping him and demanding that he perform the ordination because God had commanded it. The same angel visited Columba on three successive nights. Columba finally agreed, and Aedan came to receive ordination. At the ordination Columba told Aedan that so long as he obeyed God's laws, then none of his enemies would prevail against him, but the moment he broke them, this protection would end, and the same whip with which Columba had been struck would be turned against the king. Adomnan's writings most likely influenced other Irish writers, who in turn influenced continental ideas as well. [[Pepin the Short]]'s coronation may have also come from the same influence.<ref>Adomnan of Iona. ''Life of St Columba''. Penguin Books, 1995</ref> The Carolingian dynasty and the Holy Roman Emperors also influenced all subsequent western ideas of kingship.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the idea that God had granted earthly power to the monarch, just as he had given spiritual authority and power to the church, especially to the Pope, was already a well-known concept long before later writers coined the term \"divine right of kings\" and employed it as a theory in political science. For example, [[Richard I of England]] declared at his trial during the diet at Speyer in 1193: \"[[s:I am born in a rank which recognizes no superior but God|I am born in a rank which recognizes no superior but God, to whom alone I am responsible for my actions]]\", and it was Richard who first used the motto ''\"[[Dieu et mon droit]]\"'' (\"God and my right\") which is still the motto of the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom]].\n\nWith the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the late 16th century, the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters.  [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], and exerted the power of the throne more than any of his predecessors.  As a political theory, it was further developed by [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] (1567\u20131625), and came to the fore in England under his reign as James I of England (1603\u20131625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715) strongly promoted the theory as well.\n\n=== Scots texts of James VI of Scotland ===\nThe [[Scots language|Scots]] textbooks of the divine right of kings were written in 1597\u20131598 by James VI of Scotland. His ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'', a manual on the powers of a king, was written to edify his four-year-old son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry Frederick]] that a king \"acknowledgeth himself ordained for his people, having received from the God a burden of government, whereof he must be countable\". He based his theories in part on his understanding of the Bible, as noted by the following quote from a speech to parliament delivered in 1610 as James I of England:  \n\n{{quote|The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called gods. There be three principal [comparisons] that illustrate the state of monarchy: one taken out of the word of God, and the two other out of the grounds of policy and philosophy. In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their power after a certain relation compared to the Divine power. Kings are also compared to fathers of families; for a king is truly ''parens patriae'' [parent of the country], the politic father of his people. And lastly, kings are compared to the head of this microcosm of the body of man.<ref name=\"A speech to parliament\">[http://www.thenagain.info/Classes/Sources/JamesI.html A speech to parliament (1610)].</ref>}}\n\nJames's reference to \"God's lieutenants\" is apparently a reference to the text in Romans 13 where Paul refers to \"God's ministers\".\n\n{{quote|(1) upon removing the last just Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

(7) Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.<ref name=\"Romans 13\">{{Bibleverse|Romans|13:1-7|KJV}}</ref>}}\n\n== Western conceptions ==\n{{Main article|Sacred king|Theocracy}}\n[[File:Louis XIV habill\u00e9 en soleil.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Louis XIV of France]] depicted as the Sun King.]]\nThe conception of [[ordination]] brought with it largely unspoken parallels with the [[Anglican]] and [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priesthood]], but the overriding metaphor in James's handbook was that of a father's relation to his children. \"Just as no misconduct on the part of a father can free his children from obedience to the [[Ten Commandments|fifth commandment]]\",<ref>that is, the commandment: \"Honor your father ...\" etc., which is the fifth in the reckoning usual among Jewish, Orthodox, and Protestant denominations, but to be according to the law, yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will ...\"</ref> James also had printed his ''Defense of the Right of Kings'' in the face of English theories of inalienable popular and clerical rights. The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the church. A weaker or more moderate form of this political theory does hold, however, that the king is subject to the church and the pope, although completely irreproachable in other ways; but according to this doctrine in its strong form, only God can judge an unjust king. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act.\n\nOne passage in scripture supporting the idea of divine right of kings was used by [[Martin Luther]], when urging the secular authorities to crush the [[German Peasants' War|Peasant Rebellion of 1525]] in Germany in his ''[[Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants]]'', basing his argument on St. Paul's Epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1\u20137|NKJV}}.\n\nIt is related to the ancient Catholic philosophies regarding monarchy, in which the monarch is God's [[vicegerent]] upon the earth and therefore subject to no inferior power. However, in Roman Catholic jurisprudence, the monarch is always subject to [[Natural law|natural]] and [[divine law]], which are regarded as superior to the monarch. The possibility of monarchy declining morally, overturning natural law, and degenerating into a tyranny oppressive of the general welfare was answered theologically with the Catholic concept of extra-legal [[tyrannicide]], ideally ratified by the pope. Until the [[Papal states|unification of Italy]], the [[Bishop of Rome|Holy See]] did, from the time Christianity became the Roman [[Holy Roman Empire|state religion]], assert on that ground its primacy over secular princes; however this exercise of power never, even at its zenith, amounted to [[theocracy]], even in jurisdictions where the Bishop of Rome was the temporal authority.\n\n[[File:PapalPolitics2.JPG|upright=1.25|right|thumb|''Antichristus'', a woodcut by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], of the pope using the temporal power to grant authority to a ruler contributing generously to the Catholic Church]]\n\n=== Catholic justified permission ===\nCatholic thought justified submission to the monarchy by reference to the following:\n# The Old Testament, in which God chose kings to rule over Israel, beginning with [[Saul]] who was then rejected by God in favor of [[David]], whose dynasty continued (at least in the [[Kingdom of Judah|southern kingdom]]) until the [[Babylonian captivity]].\n# The New Testament, in which the first pope, St. Peter, commands that all Christians shall honour the Roman Emperor ({{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:13\u201320|NKJV}}), even though, at that time, he was still a pagan emperor. St. Paul agreed with St. Peter that subjects should be obedient to the powers that be because they are appointed by God, as he wrote in his Epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1-7|NKJV}}. Likewise, Jesus Christ proclaims in the Gospel of Matthew that one should \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's\"; that is at first, literally, the payment of taxes as binding those who use the imperial [[currency]] (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:15\u201322|NKJV}}). Jesus told [[Pontius Pilate]] that his authority as Roman governor of [[Judaea]] came from heaven according to {{bibleverse||John|19:10\u201311|NKJV}}.\n# The endorsement by the popes and the church of the line of emperors beginning with the Emperors [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], later the Eastern Roman emperors, and finally the Western Roman emperor, [[Charlemagne]] and his successors, the Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]].\n\nThe French Huguenot nobles and clergy, having rejected the pope and the Catholic Church, were left only with the supreme power of the king who, they taught, could not be gainsaid or judged by anyone. Since there was no longer the countervailing power of the papacy and since the Church of England was a creature of the state and had become subservient to it, this meant that there was nothing to regulate the powers of the king, and he became an absolute power. In theory, [[Divine law|divine]], [[Natural law|natural]], customary, and [[constitutional law]] still held sway over the king, but, absent a superior spiritual power, it was difficult to see how they could be enforced, since the king could not be tried by any of his own courts.\n\nSome of the symbolism within the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] ceremony for British monarchs, in which they are [[anointed]] with [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oils]] by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], thereby ''[[Holy Orders|ordaining]]'' them to monarchy, perpetuates the ancient Roman Catholic monarchical ideas and ceremonial (although few Protestants realize this, the ceremony is nearly entirely based upon that of the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, in the UK, the symbolism ends there, since the real governing authority of the monarch was all but extinguished by the Whig revolution of 1688\u201389 (see [[Glorious Revolution]]). The king or queen of the [[United Kingdom]] is one of the last monarchs still to be crowned in the traditional Christian ceremonial, which in most other countries has been replaced by an [[inauguration]] or other declaration.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[File:King Charles I from NPG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles I of England]], with a divine hand moving his crown]]\nThe concept of divine right incorporates, but exaggerates, the ancient Christian concept of \"royal God-given rights\", which teach that \"the right to rule is anointed by God\", although this idea is found in many other cultures, including [[Aryan]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] traditions. In pagan religions, the king was often seen as a kind of god and so was an unchallengeable despot. The ancient Roman Catholic tradition overcame this idea with the doctrine of the \"Two Swords\" and so achieved, for the very first time, a balanced constitution for states. The advent of Protestantism saw something of a return to the idea of a mere unchallengeable despot.\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] condoned extra-legal [[tyrannicide]] in the worst of circumstances:\n{{quote|When there is no recourse to a superior by whom judgment can be made about an invader, then he who slays a tyrant to liberate his fatherland is [to be] praised and receives a reward.|''Commentary on the Magister Sententiarum''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/regicide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064708/http://www.vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/regicide.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Aquinas forbade the overthrow of any morally, Christianly and spiritually legitimate king by his subjects. The only human power capable of deposing the king was the pope. The reasoning was that if a subject may overthrow his superior for some bad law, who was to be the judge of whether the law was bad? If the subject could so judge his own superior, then all lawful superior authority could lawfully be overthrown by the arbitrary judgement of an inferior, and thus all law was under constant threat. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, many philosophers, such as [[Nicholas of Cusa]] and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez|Francisco Suarez]], propounded similar theories. The Church was the final guarantor that Christian kings would follow the laws and constitutional traditions of their ancestors and the laws of the presumptive god and of justice. Similarly, the Chinese concept of [[Mandate of Heaven]] required that the emperor properly carry out the proper [[ritual]]s, consult his ministers, and made it extremely difficult to undo any acts carried out by an ancestor.\n\nThe French prelate [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet]] made a classic statement of the doctrine of divine right in a sermon preached before King Louis XIV:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWf5USWTfWQC&lpg=PA125&dq=bossuet%20sermons%20royalty&pg=PA219&ci=55%2C632%2C772%2C172|title=Sermons choisis de Bossuet|author=[[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet]]|work=Sur le devoir des rois}} p. 219, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWf5USWTfWQC&pg=PA219&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U0FBRrjh8fZ8ViFiVucnPKYolU_ew&ci=55%2C632%2C772%2C172&edge=0 Image]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Les rois r\u00e8gnent par moi, dit la Sagesse \u00e9ternelle: 'Per me reges regnant'; et de l\u00e0 nous devons conclure non seulement que les droits de la royaut\u00e9 sont \u00e9tablis par ses lois, mais que le choix des personnes est un effet de sa providence.}}\n{{quote|Kings reign by Me, says Eternal Wisdom: 'Per me reges regnant' [in Latin]; and from that we must conclude not only that the rights of royalty are established by its laws, but also that the choice of persons [to occupy the throne] is an effect of its providence.}}\n\n==Divine right and Protestantism==\nBefore the Reformation the anointed [[king]] was, within his [[realm]], the accredited vicar of God for secular purposes (see the [[Investiture Controversy]]); after the Reformation he (or she if [[queen regnant]]) became this in Protestant states for religious purposes also.<ref>{{EB1911 |inline=y |last=Phillip |first=Walter Alison |wstitle=King#Divine Right of Kings. |display=King \u00a7 Divine Right of Kings |volume=15 |page=806}}</ref>\n\nIn England it is not without significance that the sacerdotal vestments, generally discarded by the clergy \u2013 dalmatic, alb and stole \u2013 continued to be among the insignia of the sovereign (see [[Coronation of the British monarch]]). Moreover, this sacrosanct character he acquired not by virtue of his \"sacring\", but by hereditary right; the coronation, anointing and vesting were but the outward and visible symbol of a divine grace adherent in the sovereign by virtue of his title. Even Roman Catholic monarchs, like [[Louis XIV]], would never have admitted that their coronation by the archbishop constituted any part of their title to reign; it was no more than the consecration of their title.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}\n\nIn England the doctrine of the divine right of kings was developed to its extremest logical conclusions during the political controversies of the 17th century; its most famous exponent was Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. It was the main issue to be decided by the [[English Civil War]], the [[Cavalier|Royalist]]s holding that \"all Christian kings, princes and governors\" derive their authority direct from God, the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]]s that this authority is the outcome of a contract, actual or implied, between sovereign and people.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}\n\nIn one case the king's power would be unlimited, according to Louis XIV's famous saying: ''\"L' \u00e9tat, c'est moi!\"'',{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}} or limited only by his own free act; in the other his actions would be governed by the advice and consent of the people, to whom he would be ultimately responsible. The victory of this latter principle was proclaimed to all the world by the [[execution of Charles I]]. The doctrine of divine right, indeed, for a while drew nourishment from the blood of the royal \"martyr\";{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}} it was the guiding principle of the [[Anglican Church]] of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]; but it suffered a rude blow when [[James II of England]] made it impossible for the clergy to obey both their conscience and their king. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 made an end of it as a great political force. This has led to the constitutional development of [[the Crown]] in Britain, as held by descent modified and modifiable by parliamentary action.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}\n\n==Divine right in Asia==\nIn early Mesopotamian culture, kings were often regarded as deities after their death. [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur]] was among the first Mesopotamian rulers to declare himself to be divine. This was the direct precursor to the concept of \"Divine Right of kings\", as well as in the Egyptian and Roman religions.\n\n===Mandate of Heaven===\n{{main article|Mandate of Heaven|Son of Heaven}}\n[[File:Amaterasu cave - large - 1856.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Emperor of Japan]] rules as a divine descendant of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]] ]]\nIn [[China]] and [[East Asia]], rulers justified their rule with the philosophy of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which, although similar to the European concept, bore several key differences. While the divine right of kings granted unconditional legitimacy, the Mandate of Heaven was dependent on the behaviour of the ruler, the [[Son of Heaven]]. [[Heaven]] would bless the authority of a just ruler, but it could be displeased with a despotic ruler and thus withdraw its mandate, transferring it to a more suitable and righteous person. This withdrawal of mandate also afforded the possibility of revolution as a means to remove the errant ruler; revolt was never legitimate under the European framework of divine right.\n\nIn China, the [[right of rebellion]] against an unjust ruler had been a part of the political philosophy ever since the [[Zhou dynasty]], whose rulers had used this philosophy to justify their overthrow of the previous [[Shang dynasty]]. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on to the usurper.\n\nIn Japan, the Son of Heaven title was less conditional than its Chinese equivalent. There was no divine mandate that punished the emperor for failing to rule justly. The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], was absolute.<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Beasley|chapter=The Making of a Monarchy|title=The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22560-2|page=29|ref=harv}}</ref> The Japanese emperors traditionally wielded little secular power; generally, it was the duty of the sitting emperor to perform rituals and make public appearances, while true power was held by regents, high-ranking ministers, a commander-in-chief of the emperor's military known as the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', or even retired emperors depending on the time period.\n\n===Sultans in Southeast Asia===\nIn the [[Malay Annals]], the [[raja]]s and [[sultan]]s of the Malay States (today [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Philippines]]) as well as their predecessors, such as the [[Indonesia]]n kingdom of [[Majapahit]], also claimed divine right to rule. The sultan is mandated by God and thus is expected to lead his country and people in religious matters, ceremonies as well as prayers. This divine right is called ''Daulat'' (which means 'state' in Arabic), and although the notion of divine right is somewhat obsolete, it is still found in the phrase ''Daulat Tuanku'' that is used to publicly acclaim the reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] and the other sultans of Malaysia. The exclamation is similar to the European \"[[The king is dead, long live the king!|Long live the King]]\", and often accompanies pictures of the reigning monarch and [[Raja Permaisuri Agong|his consort]] on banners during royal occasions. In [[Indonesia]], especially on the island of [[Java]], the sultan's divine right is more commonly known as the ''way'', or 'revelation', but it is not hereditary and can be passed on to distant relatives.\n\n===South Asian kings===\nIn [[Dravidian culture]], before [[Brahmanism]] and especially during the [[Sangam period]], emperors were known as \u0b87\u0bb1\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bcd (''Iraiyer''), or \"those who spill\", and kings were called \u0b95\u0bcb (''Ko'') or \u0b95\u0bcb\u0ba9\u0bcd (''Kon''). During this time, the distinction between kingship and godhood had not yet occurred, as the [[caste]] system had not yet been introduced. Even in Modern [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the word for temple is '\u0b95\u0bcb\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd', meaning \"king's house\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramanujan|first=A.K.|title=Poems of Love and War: From the Eight Anthologies and the Ten Long Poems of Classical Tamil|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15735-3}}</ref> Kings were understood to be the \"agents of God\", as they protected the world like God did.<ref>{{cite book|last=N.

For instance, the right of a father to respect from his son did not indicate a right for the son to receive a return from that respect; and the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news\n|title = Divine Right of Kings\n|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.\n|publisher = ''BBC''\n|date = 2007-10-11\n|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights often emphasize [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, for example in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].\n\n==Opposition==\n{{further|All men are created equal}}\nIn the sixteenth century, both Catholic and Protestant political thinkers began to question the idea of a monarch's \"divine right\".\n\nThe Spanish Catholic historian [[Juan de Mariana]] put forward the argument in his book ''[[De rege et regis institutione]]'' (1598) that since society was formed by a \"pact\" among all its members, \"there can be no doubt that they are able to call a king to account\".<ref>Baer, Robert V.

The [[Marian Persecutions]] began soon afterwards. In January 1555, the first of nearly 300 Protestants were burnt at the stake under \"Bloody Mary\".
