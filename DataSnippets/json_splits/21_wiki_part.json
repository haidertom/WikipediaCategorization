It forms part of the continental boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and separates [[Anatolia|Asian Turkey]] from [[East Thrace|European Turkey]].

The Marmara further connects to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] seas via the [[Dardanelles]]. Thus, the Bosporus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal, making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].\n\nA common{{when|date=May 2018}} mistake made by those{{who|date=May 2018}} who are unfamiliar with the locale is to assume the Bosporus is a [[river]], when it is, in fact, a narrow sea channel.\n\n=== Formation ===\n{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}\n\nThe exact cause and date of the formation of the Bosporus remain the subject of debate among geologists. One recent hypothesis, dubbed the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]], which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]], postulates that the Bosporus was formed around 5600 BC when the rising waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the [[Black Sea]], which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.\n\nMany geologists,{{who|date=May 2018}} however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.\n\nFrom the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]], or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosporus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them. The Symplegades were defeated when the lyrical hero [[Jason]] obtained successful passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.\n\n=== Present morphology ===\nThe limits of the Bosporus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses of [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north, and between the [[Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 Feneri]] and the [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between these limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Liman\u0131, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[A\u015fiyan]].\n\nThe depth of the Bosporus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shallowest locations are off Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off A\u015fiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"d\" />\n\nThe [[Golden Horn]] is an [[estuary]] off the main strait that historically acted as a moat to protect Old Istanbul from attack, as well as providing a sheltered anchorage for the imperial navies of various empires until the 19th century, after which it became a historic neighborhood at the heart of the city, popular with tourists and locals alike.\n\n=== Newer explorations ===\nIt had been known since before the 20th century that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in a geographic example of \"density flow\", and in August 2010, a continuous 'underwater channel' of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] composition was discovered to flow along the floor of the Bosporus, which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land.<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\">{{cite news |title=Leeds Researchers Study Undersea Rivers with a Yellow Submarine |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803145648/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2 August 2010 |access-date=22 June 2018}}</ref> The study of the [[water erosion|water]] and [[wind erosion]] of the straits relates to that of its formation. Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.\n\nThe 2010 team of scientists, led by the [[University of Leeds]], used a robotic \"yellow submarine\" to observe detailed flows within an \"undersea river\", scientifically referred to as a [[submarine channel]],<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/> for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents\u2014underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets\u2014from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.<ref name=\"leeds.ac.uk\"/>\n\nThe team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:\n\n{{quote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|title=Robotic sub records flow of undersea river \u2013 Futurity|date=2 August 2010|publisher=}}</ref>}}\n\nThe central tenet of the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]] is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosporus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was supported by findings of undersea explorer [[Robert Ballard]], who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the [[flood]] to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, which is how it probably entered most religions.  As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.\n\nThe first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size<ref>Di Iorio, D., and Y\u00fcce, H.

The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.\n\nThe project was led by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons at the [[University of Leeds]], in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the [[Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University|Institute of Marine Sciences]]. The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].\n\n== History ==\nAs part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].\n\n=== Ancient Greek, Persian, Roman and Byzantine eras (pre-1453) ===\n[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|thumb|250px| Map of Constantinople (modern-day [[Istanbul]]), designed in 1422 by [[Florence|Florentine]] cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]].

The Greek city-state of [[Athens]] in the 5th century BC, which was dependent on grain imports from [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara|Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].\n\nPersian King [[Darius I]] the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed through the Bosporus, then marched towards the [[River Danube]].

Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarised the straits area. The reversion was formalised under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of 20 July 1936. That convention, which is still in force, treats the straits as an international shipping lane save that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non\u2013Black Sea states.\n\nTurkey was neutral in the [[Second World War]] until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German [[auxiliaries|auxiliary vessels]] were permitted to transit. In diplomatic conferences, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] representatives had made known [[Turkish Straits crisis|their interest]] in Turkish concession of Soviet naval bases on the straits. This, as well as Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey in the Russo\u2013Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921), were considerations in Turkey's decision to abandon [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality in foreign affairs]].

Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosporus and the Dardanelles straits. In 2011 Turkey planned a 50&nbsp;km canal through [[Silivri]] as a second waterway, reducing risk in the Bosporus.<ref name=\"Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass\">\"[http://www.nce.co.uk/news/water/turkey-to-build-bosphorus-bypass/8614313.article Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass]\" ''[[New Civil Engineer]]'', 20 April 2011.

Between its northern limits at [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] and its southern ones at [[Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 Feneri]] and [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u0130nciburnu Feneri]], there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[A\u015fiyan]] requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yenik\u00f6y, Istanbul|Yenik\u00f6y]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. Compounding these difficult changes in trajectory, the rear and forward sight lines at [[Kandilli, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Kandilli]] and [[Yenik\u00f6y, Istanbul|Yenik\u00f6y]] are also completely blocked prior to and during the course alteration, making it impossible for ships approaching from the opposite direction to see around these bends. The risks posed by geography are further multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city. As such, all the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane.\n\nIn 2011, the Turkish Government discussed creating a large-scale canal project roughly {{convert|80|km|mi}} long that runs north-south through [[Silivri|the western edges of Istanbul Province]] as a second waterway between the Black Sea and the Marmara, intended to reduce risk in the Bosphorus.<ref name=\"Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass\" /><ref name=\"ing.dk\" /> This [[Kanal \u0130stanbul]] project currently continues to be debated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=\u0130stanbul Canal project to open debate on Montreux Convention |date=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430073318/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-debates-whether-international-treaty-is-obstacle-to-plan-to-bypass-the-bosporus/2011/04/29/AFcaFrCF_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Turkey debates whether international treaty is obstacle to plan to bypass the Bosporus |date=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= Turkey's Ambitious Canal Proposal | url= http://www.stratfor.com/image/turkeys-ambitious-canal-proposal | publisher=[[STRATFOR]] | date= May 16, 2013| accessdate=2013-05-16|quote=Registry required.}}</ref>\n\n=== Land ===\nTwo [[suspension bridge]]s and a [[cable-stayed bridge]] cross the Bosphorus.

The names of all the municipalities in the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] are also of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] origin, except for [[Evere]], which is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]].\n\n=== Pronunciation ===\nIn [[French language|French]], ''Bruxelles'' is pronounced {{IPA-fr|b\u0281ys\u025bl|}} (the ''x'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|s}}, like in [[English language|English]]) and in Dutch, ''Brussel'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|\u02c8br\u028fs\u0259l|}}. Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as ''Bruxellois'' and in Dutch as ''Brusselaars''. In the [[Brabantian dialect]] of Brussels, they are called ''Brusseleers'' or ''Brusseleirs''.\n\nOriginally, the written ''x'' noted the group {{IPAc-en|k|s}}. In the [[Belgian French]] pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the ''k'' eventually disappeared and ''z'' became ''s'', as reflected in the current [[Dutch orthography|Dutch spelling]], whereas in the more conservative [[French orthography|French form]], the spelling remained. The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|k|s}} in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels' usage. In [[France]], the pronunciations {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025bl|}} and {{IPA-fr|b\u0281yks\u025blwa|}} (for ''bruxellois'') are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fortifications of Brussels|Belgian Revolution|Francization of Brussels|Brussels and the European Union#History|Timeline of Brussels}}\n:''See also: [[:fr:Histoire de Bruxelles|History of Brussels]] (in French)''\n[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels {{circa}} 979]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Quote box\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| quote = {{flagicon image|Armoiries de Vianden 3.svg}} [[County of Leuven]] c. 1000\u20131183<br />{{flagicon image|Royal Arms of Belgium.svg}} [[Duchy of Brabant]] 1183\u20131430<br />{{flagicon image|Flag of the Low Countries.svg}} [[Burgundian Netherlands]] 1430\u20131482<br />{{flagicon image|Bandera cruz de Borgo\u00f1a 2.svg}} [[Spanish Netherlands]] 1482\u20131714<br />{{flagicon image|Austrian Low Countries Flag.svg}} [[Austrian Netherlands]] 1714\u20131746<br />{{flagicon image|Royal Standard of the King of France.svg}} [[Kingdom of France]] 1746\u20131749<br />{{flagicon image|Austrian Low Countries Flag.svg}} [[Austrian Netherlands]] 1749\u20131794<br />{{flag|French First Republic}} 1795\u20131804<br />{{flagicon image|Flag of France (1794\u20131815, 1830\u20131958).svg}} [[First French Empire]] 1804\u20131815<br />{{flag|Netherlands|name=United Kingdom of the Netherlands}} 1815\u20131830<br />{{flag|Belgium|name=Kingdom of Belgium}} 1830\u2013present\n| align = right\n| width = 24em\n| fontsize = 90%\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n}}\n\nThe history of Brussels is closely linked to that of [[Western Europe]]. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone Age]], with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of [[megalith]]s, [[dolmen]]s and [[Menhir|standing stones]] (''Plattesteen'', ''Tomberg''). During [[late antiquity]], the region was home to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered near the centre.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_decouverte-majeure-a-bruxelles-des-vestiges-romains-retrouves-sur-le-site-de-tour-et-taxis?id=9048235|title=Bruxelles: des vestiges romains retrouv\u00e9s sur le site de Tour et Taxis|date=6 August 2015|work=RTBF Info|access-date=28 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/news/les-romains-de-tour-et-taxis|title=Les Romains de Tour & Taxis \u2014 Patrimoine \u2013 Erfgoed|website=patrimoine.brussels|language=fr|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> Following the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]].\n\nThe origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref> The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[Lambert I of Leuven]], Count of [[County of Leuven|Leuven]], gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (''Treurenberg'', ''[[Coudenberg]]'' and [[Sablon (Brussels)|''Sablon'']] areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]] (1225), replacing an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]]. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the early 13th century, Brussels got [[Fortifications of Brussels|its first walls]],<ref>{{cite web |language=nl |url=http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |title=Zo ontstond Brussel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120140134/http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |trans-title=This is how Brussels originated |publisher=Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie [Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels]}}</ref> and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected, between 1356 and 1383. Traces of it can still be seen today, mostly because the ''[[small ring]]'', a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.\n\n=== Early modern ===\n[[File:Brussel.1610.a.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Brussels {{circa}} 1610|alt=]]\nIn the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] with [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]] perished in the [[Battle of Nancy]]. Through the marriage of his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the [[Low Countries]] fell under [[Habsburg]] sovereignty. Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Burgundian Netherlands]], also known as the [[Seventeen Provinces]], and flourished. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] succeeded as Duke of Brabant. In 1506, he became [[Crown of Castile|King of Castile]], and hence the period of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] began.\n\nIn 1516, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who had been heir of the Low Countries since 1506, was declared [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] in the [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula]]. Upon the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519, Charles became the new ruler of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and was subsequently elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731. In the 17th century, the city was a capital of the [[lace]] industry.\n[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Place]] after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]\nIn 1695, during the [[Nine Years' War]], King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings \u2013 a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.\n\nFollowing the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Brussels [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of [[Napoleon]] on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Southern Netherlands joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], under [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.\n\n=== Late modern ===\n[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Wappers]] (1834)]]\nIn 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] took place in Brussels, after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at [[La Monnaie]] theatre. The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]], ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.\n\nFollowing independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies put into orbit by the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the building of the [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The [[Free University of Brussels]] was established in 1834. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] with [[Mechelen]].\n[[File:Bruxelles, Place Royale, -Brussels, Belgium--LCCN2001697909.jpg|thumb|[[Place Royale (Brussels)|Place Royale]], late 19th century]]\nDuring the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The [[Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor [[Jules Anspach]], its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings of ''[[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann|hausmannien]]'' style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]] (1873), the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] (1883) and [[Saint Mary's Royal Church]] (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. The [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|International Exposition of 1897]] contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]]), in the suburb of [[Tervuren]], was connected to the capital by the construction of an [[Avenue de Tervueren|11-km long grand alley]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference]]\nDuring the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the [[Solvay Conference]] on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the [[Brussels International 1910|Brussels International Exposition of 1910]], the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the [[Expo '58]]. During [[World War I]], Brussels was an [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During [[World War II]], it was again [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied by German forces]], and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] on 3 September 1944. The [[Brussels Airport]], in the suburb of [[Zaventem]], dates from the occupation.\n\nAfter the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the [[North\u2013South connection]], linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro|''premetro'']] was finished in 1969, and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the [[European Union]], and many modern buildings were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of ''[[Brusselization|Brusselisation]]''.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThe Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989, after a constitutional reform in 1988. It is one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]], along with [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]], and has bilingual status.<ref name=\"Belgian Constitution\" /><ref name=\"CIRB-creation\" /> The [[yellow iris]] is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylised version in shown on its official flag.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&la=F&nm=1991031159&table_name=titre |language=fr |title=LOI \u2013 WET |website=www.ejustice.just.fgov.be |access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Brussels has become an important venue for international events.

The [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]], where the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of Belgium]] exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside the [[Brussels Park]] (not to be confused with the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], the official home of the Belgian Royal Family).

Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education, as well as a [[Common Community Commission|Common Community]] for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social [[welfare]].\n\nSince the splitting of [[Brabant (province)|Brabant]] in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the [[Provinces of Belgium|provinces]] of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].\n\n===Institutions===\n{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}\n[[File:Parlement r\u00e9gion Bruxelles-Capitale.JPG|left|thumb|[[Brussels Parliament building]]]]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region|parliament]] of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking \u2013 parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region|minister-president]], four ministers and three [[Secretary of state|state secretaries]]. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact [[Ordinance (Belgium)|ordinances]] (French: ''ordonnances'', Dutch: ''ordonnanties''), which have equal status as a national legislative act.\n\n19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.\n\n===Agglomeration of Brussels===\nBefore the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the ''Brussels Agglomeration''. The ''Brussels Agglomeration'' was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wet houdende organisatie van de agglomeraties en de federaties van gemeenten|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&cn=1971072630&table_name=wet|website=Belgi\u00eblex.be|publisher=FOD Justitie|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Brussels Agglomeration'' had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.\n\nAfter the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the ''Brussels Agglomeration'' was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.\n\n==French and Flemish communities==\n{{Main|French Community Commission|Flemish Community Commission}}\n[[File:Communities_of_Belgium.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Communities_of_Belgium.svg|thumb|Communities of Belgium:\n{{legend|#fab274|[[Flemish Community]] / Dutch language area}}{{legend striped|#fab274|#f2536b|Flemish & French Community / bilingual language area|up=yes}}{{legend|#f2536b|[[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] / French language area}}{{legend|#40bb6a|[[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]] / German language area}}]]\nThe [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the [[French Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire fran\u00e7aise'' or ''COCOF'') and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: ''Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie'' or ''VGC''). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]]. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nThe French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).<ref>Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.<ref>Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution</ref> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical [[federalism]]. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.\n\n===Common Community Commission===\nA bi-communitarian public authority, the [[Common Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire commune, COCOM'', Dutch: ''Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC'') also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers \u2013 not the secretaries of state \u2013 of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact [[by-law]]s. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities).

It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne square, it lies today in the northwest of the region, on the [[Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal]] (commonly called ''Willebroek Canal),'' which connects Brussels to [[Antwerp]] via the [[Scheldt]]. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the [[Brussels\u2013Charleroi Canal]], in the very heart of the capital, creates a north-south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] ([[Wallonia]]). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important [[Canal inclined plane|inclined plane]] of [[Ronqui\u00e8res inclined plane|Ronqui\u00e8res]] and the lifts of [[Str\u00e9py-Bracquegnies]].\n\nThe importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year \u2013 almost 2,000 per day \u2013 which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.port.brussels/en|title=Port of Brussels|website=Port of Brussels|language=en|access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Train===\n{{Further|List of railway stations in Belgium}}[[File:Gare de Bruxelles-Midi Station Brussel-Zuid.jpg|thumb|left|Main hall of [[Brussels-South railway station]], home to the [[Eurostar]] train service to [[London]]]]\n[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ''([[Intercity-Express|ICE]] train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured)'']]\nThe Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|North]], which are the busiest of the country.<ref name=\":2\"/> Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to [[London]] by [[Eurostar]] trains via the [[Channel Tunnel]] (1hr 51min); to [[Amsterdam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distcalculator.com/distance-between/277151/Brussels-Belgium-and-Amsterdam-The-Netherlands|title=Distance between Brussels, Belgium and Amsterdam, The Netherlands|work=Distances Technology|accessdate=11 Feb 2018}}</ref> by [[Thalys]] and ''InterCity'' connections; to Amsterdam, [[Paris]] (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively {{as of|lc=y|2015|April|6}}), and [[Cologne]] by [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne (2hr 59min) and [[Frankfurt]] (3hr 16min) by the German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]].\n\nThe train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the [[North\u2013South connection]], with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground.

In 2006, a [[Community bicycle program|public bicycle-sharing programme]] was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by ''[[Villo!]]''. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by ''Collecto'', a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the ''Zen Car'' electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.\n\n===Road network===\n[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi]]/[[Wetstraat]] is one of the city's main streets]]\n\nIn medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chauss\u00e9e de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du March\u00e9 aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat).

In 1925, after years of conducting research and development under [[Western Electric]], [[AT&T|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T Corporation), Western Electric divided ownership of the newly formed Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n\nResearchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), [[information theory]], the [[Unix]] operating system, and the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[S (programming language)|S]]. Nine [[Nobel Prize]]s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.\n\n==Origin and historical locations==\n\n=== Bell's personal research after the telephone ===\nIn 1880, the [[France|French government]] awarded [[Alexander Graham Bell]] the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 [[French franc|francs]], approximately US$10,000 at that time (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1879|r=-4}}}} in current dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) for the [[invention of the telephone]]. Bell used the award to fund the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] (''Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory'') in  [[Washington, D.C.]], in collaboration with [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin [[Chichester Bell]].<ref name=\"Bruce1990\">Bruce, Robert V.

[[Alexander Graham Bell]], Thomas Sanders, and Gardiner Hubbard formed the Bell Patent Association when filing the first patents for the telephone in 1876. A year later, the first telephone company was formed as Bell Telephone Company and later became a part of the American Bell Telephone Company. By 1889, its own subsidiary company, [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) took control of American Bell and the Bell System. American Bell held a controlling interest in Western Electric which was the manufacturing arm of the business whereas AT&T was doing research into the service providers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Telephone Enterprise|last=Garnet|first=Robert|publisher=The John's Hopkins University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=1\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/about/history-bell-labs/|title=Nokia Bell Labs History|last=|first=|date=20 July 2018|website=Nokia Bell Labs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1884, the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] created the Mechanical Department from the Electrical and [[Patent]] Department formed a year earlier.\n\n===Formal organization and location changes===\n[[File:Bell Laboratories West Street.jpg|alt=463 West Street New York Bell Labs|thumb|The original home of Bell Laboratories beginning in 1925, 463 West Street, New York.]]\nIn 1896, Western Electric bought property at [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|463 West Street]] to station their manufacturers and engineers who had been supplying AT&T with their product. This included everything from [[telephone]]s, [[telephone exchange]] switches, and transmission equipment. In 1925, Bell Laboratories was developed to better consolidate the research activities of the Bell System. Ownership was evenly split between [[Western Electric]] and [[AT&T]] and throughout the next decade, the [[AT&T]] Research and Development branch moved into West Street. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the [[Bell Telephone Company]], U.S. government work, and a few workers were assigned to basic research. The first president of research at Bell Labs was [[Frank B. Jewett]] who stayed there until 1940.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donofrio|first=Angelo|date=May\u2013June 1966|title=West Street Story|url=|journal=Bell Labs Reporter|volume=15|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Idea Factory|last=Gertner|first=Jon|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Manufacturing the Future|last=Adams, Butler|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Bell Labs engineers and scientists had begun to move to other locations away from the congestion and environmental distractions of New York City, and in 1967 Bell Laboratories headquarters was officially relocated to [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill,]] New Jersey.

Shewhart]] proposed the [[control chart]] as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewhart's methods were the basis for [[statistical process control]] (SPC): the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including [[Six Sigma]].\n\nIn 1927, a Bell team headed by [[Herbert E. Ives]] successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line [[television]] images of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] from Washington to New York. In 1928 the [[thermal noise]] in a resistor was first measured by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B. Johnson]], and [[Harry Nyquist]] provided the theoretical analysis; this is now termed ''Johnson noise''. During the 1920s, the [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]] was invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] at the laboratories. Bell Labs' [[Claude Shannon]] later proved that it is unbreakable.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:Green Banks - Jansky Antena.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1932]]\n\nIn 1931, a foundation for [[radio astronomy]] was laid by [[Karl Jansky]] during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance [[Shortwave bands|shortwave communications]]. He discovered that [[radio]] waves were being emitted from the center of the [[galaxy]]. In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]].<ref>[http://www.stokowski.org/Harvey%20Fletcher%20Bell%20Labs%20Recordings.htm Leopold Stokowski, Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Laboratories Experimental Recordings], Stokowski.org.

During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee \u2013 Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.\n\nIn 1947, the [[transistor]], probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]] (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, [[Richard Hamming]] invented [[Hamming code]]s for [[error detection and correction]]. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, \"[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]\", one of the founding works in [[information theory]], was published by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]], but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of [[History of cryptography|modern cryptography]] with his 1949 paper ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]''.\n\n====Calculators====\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-10-01|title=George Stibitz|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stibitz#Other|journal=Wikipedia|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irvine|first=M.

The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD [[Microwave radio relay]], [[Direct Distance Dialing]], E-[[repeaters]], [[Wire spring relay]]s, and [[5XB switch|improved switching]] systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the [[Karnaugh map]] as a tool to facilitate management of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebraic]] expressions. In 1954, the first modern [[solar cell]] was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 [[TAT-1]], the first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.<!-- What was Bell Labs' involvement in that?--> A year later, in 1957, [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC]], one of the first computer programs to play [[electronic music]], was created by [[Max Mathews]]. New [[greedy algorithm]]s developed by [[Robert C. Prim]] and [[Joseph Kruskal]], revolutionized [[network planning and design|computer network design]].

Bennett, Jr.|William Bennett]] and [[Donald Heriot]] successfully operated the first [[gas laser]], the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. Also in 1960, [[Dawon Kahng]] and [[Martin Atalla]] invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor ([[MOSFET]]); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the [[Large-scale integration|large-scale integrated circuits]] (LSIs) underlying today's information society. In 1962, the [[electret microphone]] was invented by [[Gerhard Sessler|Gerhard M. Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West]]. Also in 1962, [[John R. Pierce]]'s vision of [[communications satellite]]s was realized by the launch of [[Telstar]]. In 1964, the [[Carbon dioxide laser]] was invented by [[Kumar Patel]]. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[cosmic microwave background]], for which they were awarded the [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/ Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978]. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. Ken C. Knowlton invented the computer animation language [[BEFLIX]]. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] was developed by [[J.R. Arthur]] and [[A.Y. Cho]]; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] created the computer operating system [[UNIX]] for the support of telecommunication switching systems as well as general purpose computing. From 1969 to 1971, [[Aaron Marcus]], the first graphic designer involved with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone. In 1969, the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) was invented by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]], for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|New York City site]] was sold and became the [[Westbeth Artists Community]] complex.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:The C Programming Language logo.svg|left|thumb|125px|The C programming language was developed in 1972.]]\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the [[personal computing]] revolution. In 1972, [[Dennis Ritchie]] developed the compiled programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] as a replacement for the interpreted language [[B (programming language)|B]] which was then used in a [[worse is better]] rewrite of UNIX.  Also, the language [[AWK]] was designed and implemented by [[Alfred Aho]], [[Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]] of Bell Laboratories.\n\nIn 1970, [[A. Michael Noll]] invented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized [[telephone exchange]] switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by [[Erna Schneider Hoover]], who received one of the first [[software patent]]s for it. In 1976, [[Optical fiber]] systems were first tested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and in 1980, the first single-chip [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]], the [[Bellmac 32]]A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.\n\nThe 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; [[1ESS switch|1A]]/[[4ESS switch|#4 TOLL]] Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}<!-- Fact tag for the whole paragraph -->\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Bell Labs logo, 1984-1995.png|frame|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1995]]\n\nIn 1980, the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[CDMA]] digital cellular telephone technology was patented.

This type of antenna became an important component in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. In 1984, [[Karmarkar's algorithm]] for linear programming was developed by mathematician [[Narendra Karmarkar]]. Also in 1984, [[Modification of Final Judgment|a divestiture agreement]] signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: [[Bellcore]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created [[local exchange carrier]]s. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. ''Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.'' became a wholly owned company of the new [[AT&T Technologies]] unit, the former Western Electric. The [[5ESS Switch]] was developed during this transition. In 1985, [[laser cooling]] was used to slow and manipulate atoms by [[Steven Chu]] and team. In 1985, the modeling language ''A Mathematical Programming Language'' [[AMPL]] was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] \"For contribution over decades to modern communication systems\". During the 1980s, the operating system ''[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]'' was developed extending the UNIX model. Also, the [[Radiodrum]], an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented. In 1988, [[TAT-8]] became the first transatlantic [[fiber-optic cable]]. Bell Labs in Freehold, NJ developed the 1.3-micron fiber, cable, splicing, laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.\n\nArthur Ashkin invented optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers. A major breakthrough came in 1987, when Ashkin used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. He immediately began studying biological systems and optical tweezers are now widely used to investigate the machinery of life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Lucent Technologies logo.svg|thumb|200px|Lucent Logo bearing the \"Bell Labs Innovations\" tagline]]\n\nIn 1991, the 56K [[modem]] technology was patented by Nuri Da\u011fdeviren and his team. In 1994, the [[quantum cascade laser]] was invented by [[Federico Capasso]], [[Alfred Cho]], Jerome Faist and their collaborators. Also in 1994, [[Peter Shor]] devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron [[lithography]], which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The operating system [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the then-new [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] programming language [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]]. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970116221538/http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/]</ref>\n\nIn 1996, AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment manufacturing business, into a new company named [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]]. AT&T retained a small number of researchers who made up the staff of the newly created [[AT&T Labs]].\n\nIn 1997, the smallest then-practical transistor (60 [[nanometer]]s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first [[Optical IP Switching|optical router]] was invented.\n\n===2000s===\n[[Image:Alcatel Lucent Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Pre-2013 logo of Alcatel-Lucent, parent company of Bell Labs]]\n\n2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which [[DNA machine]] prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered [[Dye laser|organic laser]] invented; a large-scale map of cosmic [[dark matter]] was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes [[Organic electronics|plastic transistors]] possible, was invented.\n\nIn 2002, physicist [[Sch\u00f6n scandal|Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n was fired]] after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.\n\nIn 2003, the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.njnano.org/resources/index.shtml New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium.

On 1 December 2006, the merged company, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive [[U.S. government]] contracts.\n\nIn December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.\n\nAs of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics research, according to a report by the scientific journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html |title=Access : Bell Labs bottoms out : Nature News |publisher=Nature.com |author=Geoff Brumfiel |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907044552/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080820/full/454927a.html| archivedate= 7 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2008/08/bell-labs-kills/|first = Priya|last = Ganapati|title = Bell Labs Kills Fundamental Physics Research|date = 2008-08-27|accessdate = 2008-08-28|website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828233520/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html|archivedate = 28 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl = no}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Willard Boyle and George Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention and development of the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics - Press Release |website=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:Nokia Bell Labs sign.jpg|thumb|250px|Nokia Bell Labs entrance sign at New Jersey headquarters in 2016]]\nIn February 2013, Gee Rittenhouse, former Head of Research returned from his position as Chief Operating Officer of Alcatel-Lucent's Software, Services, and Solutions business to become the 12th President of Bell Labs.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Gee Rittenhouse to take over as President of world-famous research institution Bell Labs |url=https://www.alcatel-lucent.com/press/2013/002793 |location=Paris |publisher=Alcatel-Lucent |agency= |date=February 18, 2013 |access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2013, Alcatel-Lucent announced the appointment of [[Marcus Weldon]] as President of Bell Labs.

The brain is located in the [[head]], usually close to the sensory organs for [[sense]]s such as [[Visual perception|vision]]. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the [[cerebral cortex]] contains approximately 10\u201320 billion [[neuron]]s,<ref name=\"pmid27187682\">{{Cite journal|last=von Bartheld|first=Christopher S.|last2=Bahney|first2=Jami|last3=Herculano-Houzel|first3=Suzana|date=2016-12-15|title=The search for true numbers of neurons and glial cells in the human brain: A review of 150 years of cell counting|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|volume=524|issue=18|pages=3865\u20133895|doi=10.1002/cne.24040|issn=1096-9861|pmc=5063692|pmid=27187682}}</ref> and the estimated number of neurons in the [[cerebellum]] is 55\u201370 billion.<ref name=\"pmid27187682\" /> Each neuron is connected by [[synapse]]s to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long [[protoplasm]]ic fibers called [[axon]]s, which carry trains of signal pulses called [[action potential]]s to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\n\n[[Physiology|Physiologically]], the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called [[hormone]]s. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Some basic types of responsiveness such as [[reflex]]es can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral [[ganglion|ganglia]], but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.\n\nThe operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The new century of the brain |journal=Scientific American |date=March 2014 |volume=310 |issue=3 |pages=38\u201345 |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/faculty/yuste/Publications/Yuste_Church_SciAm14.pdf |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0314-38 |pmid=24660326 |last1=Yuste |first1=Rafael |last2=Church |first2=George M. |bibcode=2014SciAm.310c..38Y |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190157/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/faculty/yuste/Publications/Yuste_Church_SciAm14.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df=}}</ref> Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.\n\nThis article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the [[human brain]] insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.

Neurons are created in special zones that contain [[stem cell]]s, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 4-->\n\nFor vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar across all species.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 1--> As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of [[ectoderm]] running along the midline of the back is [[cellular differentiation|induced]] to become the [[neural plate]], the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the [[neural groove]], and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the [[neural tube]], a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the [[prosencephalon|forebrain]], [[mesencephalon|midbrain]], and [[rhombencephalon|hindbrain]]. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the [[cerebrum|telencephalon]] (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the [[diencephalon]] (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the [[metencephalon]] (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the [[myelencephalon]] (which will contain the [[medulla oblongata]]). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 1-->\n\nOnce a neuron is in place, it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a [[growth cone]], studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of [[gene]]s create products that influence axonal pathfinding.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 5 and 7-->\n\nThe synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In many parts of the brain, axons initially \"overgrow\", and then are \"pruned\" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 12--> In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the [[retina]] to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.<ref name=Wong>{{cite journal |last=Wong |first=R |year=1999 |title=Retinal waves and visual system development |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=22 |pages=29\u201347 |pmid=10202531 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.22.1.29}}</ref>\n\nSimilar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.<ref name=Wong />\n\nIn humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.<ref name=\"Purves 1985\"/><!--Ch. 6--> There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult [[neurogenesis]] is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life.

A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.<ref name=CarewCh1>{{cite book |last=Carew |first=TJ |title=Behavioral Neurobiology: the Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87893-092-0 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=wEMTGwAACAAJ |chapter=Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Perception===\n[[File:Hearing mechanics cropped.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing showing the ear, inner ear, and brain areas involved in hearing. A series of light blue arrows shows the flow of signals through the system.|Diagram of signal processing in the [[auditory system]].]]\nThe human brain is provided with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the [[Magnetoception|magnetic field sense]] of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.\n\nEach sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells,<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 21--> such as light-receptive neurons in the [[retina]] of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the [[cochlea]] of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their signals to a [[sensory system|first-order sensory nucleus]] dedicated to one specific [[Stimulus modality|sensory modality]]. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the [[thalamus]], the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and [[Multisensory integration|integrated]] with signals coming from other sensory systems.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 21-->\n\n===Motor control===\n[[Motor system]]s are areas of the brain that are involved in [[motor control|initiating body movements]], that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by [[motor neuron]]s in the spinal cord and hindbrain.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch 34--> Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many [[reflex]] responses, and contain [[central pattern generator|pattern generators]] for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 36 and 37-->\n\nThe brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the [[red nucleus]], which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the [[primary motor cortex]], a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the [[pyramidal tract]]. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 33-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ Major areas involved in controlling movement\n|-\n!

Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 45-->\n\nA key component of the arousal system is the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the [[optic nerves]] from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, [[circadian rhythm]]s: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of \"clock genes\". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Antle |first=MC |title=Orchestrating time: arrangements of the brain circadian clock |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |year=2005 |volume=28 |pages=145\u2013151 |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/silver/publications2/149%20antle%20et%20al.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=15749168 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.01.003 |last2=Silver |first2=R |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031120051/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/silver/publications2/149%20antle%20et%20al.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the [[reticular formation]], a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 45-->\n\nSleep involves great changes in brain activity.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 47--> Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kleitman |first=N |year=1938 |others=revised 1963, reprinted 1987 |title=Sleep and Wakefulness |publisher=The University of Chicago Press, Midway Reprints series |isbn=978-0-226-44073-6}}</ref> but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There are two types of sleep: ''[[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]'' (with dreaming) and ''[[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]]'' (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called [[slow wave sleep]], activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.<ref name=\"Kandel 2000\"/><!--Ch. 47-->\n\n===Homeostasis===\n[[File:LocationOfHypothalamus.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section of a human head, showing location of the [[hypothalamus]].]]\n\nFor any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others.<ref name=Dougherty/> The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body\u2014the [[milieu int\u00e9rieur]], as pioneering physiologist [[Claude Bernard]] called it\u2014is known as [[homeostasis]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for \"standing still\").<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gross |first=CG |year=1998 |title=Claude Bernard and the constancy of the internal environment |journal=The Neuroscientist |volume=4 |pages=380\u2013385 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1177/107385849800400520 |issue=5}}</ref> Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain.

Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the [[pituitary gland]], a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=P |title=Hypothalamic control of pituitary hormone |publisher=Neuroscience Online |url=http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s4/chapter02.html |accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Motivation===\n[[File:Basal ganglia.svg|thumb|right|350px|Components of the basal ganglia, shown in two cross-sections of the human brain.

Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively.

Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kolb |first=B |last2=Whishaw |first2=I |title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology |year=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-7167-9586-5 |chapter=Ch. 1}}</ref>\n\nComputational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation. On one hand, it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as ''biologically realistic neural networks''. On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified \"units\" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity.

Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called ''pneumata psychikon'', usually translated as \"animal spirits\".<ref name=Finger14/> Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical ''res cogitans'', but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finger |first=S |title=Origins of Neuroscience |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-514694-3 |pages=193\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nThe first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of [[Luigi Galvani]] (1737 \u2013 1798), who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract.

Traditional legend says [[Byzas]] from [[Megara]] (a city-state near [[Athens]]) founded Byzantium in 667 BC when he sailed northeast across the [[Aegean Sea]]. The tradition tells that Byzas, son of King [[Nisos]] (\u039d\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2), planned to found a colony of the [[Dorians|Dorian]] Greek city of [[Megara]]. Byzas consulted the [[Delphic oracle|oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]], which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the \"Land of the Blind\".  Leading a group of Megarian colonists, Byzas found a location where the [[Golden Horn]], a great natural harbor, meets the [[Bosporus]] and flows into the [[Sea of Marmara]], opposite [[Chalcedon]] (modern day [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]]). He adjudged the Chalcedonians blind not to have recognized the advantages the land on the [[Europe]]an side of the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] had over the Asiatic side. In 667 BC he founded Byzantium at their location, thus fulfilling the oracle's requirement.\n\nIt was mainly a trading city due to its location at the [[Black Sea]]'s only entrance. Byzantium later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side.\n\nThe city was taken by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] at the time of the [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|Scythian campaign]] (513 BC) of King [[Darius I]] (r. 522-486 BC), and was added to the administrative province of [[Skudra]].{{sfn|Balcer|1990|pages=599-600}} Though [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] control of the city was never as stable as compared to other cities in [[Thrace]], it was considered, alongside [[Sestos]], to be one of the foremost Achaemenid ports on the European coast of the Bosporus and the [[Hellespont]].{{sfn|Balcer|1990|pages=599-600}}\n\nByzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. As part of [[Sparta]]'s strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens, Sparta took the city in 411 BC. The [[Athenian military]] later took the city in 408 BC.<ref>\"Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean,\" Oxford University Press, 2nd Edition, 2004, p. 302</ref>\n\nAfter siding with [[Pescennius Niger]] against the victorious [[Septimius Severus]], the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k1thG1smoSMC&pg=PA8 ''Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Istanbul'' Robert Bator, Chris Rothero p.8]</ref> Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus, now emperor, and quickly regained its previous prosperity. It was bound to [[Marmara Ere\u011flisi|Perinthos]] during the period of Septimius Severus. The location of Byzantium attracted [[Constantine I (emperor)|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] who, in 330 AD, refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by Rome itself. (See [[New Rome|Nova Roma]].) After his death the city was called [[Constantinople]] (Greek \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, ''Konstantinoupolis'', \"city of Constantine\").\n\nThis combination of imperialism and location would affect Constantinople's role as the nexus between the continents of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. It was a commercial, cultural, and diplomatic centre. With its strategic position, Constantinople controlled the major trade routes between Asia and Europe, as well as the passage from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. On May 29, 1453, the city fell to the [[Ottoman Turks]], and again became the capital of a powerful state, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Turks called the city \"Istanbul\" (although it was not officially renamed until 1930); the name derives from \"eis-ten-polin\" (Greek: \"to-the-city\"). To this day it remains the largest and most populous city in [[Turkey]], although [[Ankara]] is now the national capital.\n\n===Emblem===\n{{main|Star and crescent}}\nBy the late [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or early Roman period (1st century BC), the [[star and crescent]] motif was associated to some degree with Byzantium; even though it became more widely used as the royal emblem of [[Mithradates VI Eupator]] (who for a time incorporated the city into his empire).<ref>Andrew G. Traver, ''From Polis to Empire, The Ancient World, [[circa|ca.]] 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p257</ref>\n\nSome Byzantine coins of the 1st century BC and later show the head of [[Artemis]] with bow and quiver, and feature a crescent with what appears to be an eight-rayed star on the reverse. \nAccording to accounts which vary in some of the details, in 340 BC the Byzantines and their allies the [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] were under siege by the troops of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]]. On a particularly dark and wet night Philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky. This light is occasionally described by subsequent interpreters as a meteor, sometimes as the moon, and some accounts also mention the barking of dogs. However, the original accounts mention only a bright light in the sky, without specifying the moon.<ref>\"In 340 BC, however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon. In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to [[Hecate]], they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]\" William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003 p5-6; \"If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was [[Hecate]]. [[Hecate]] had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of \"liminal places,\" in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. [[Hecate]]'s importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions. Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history. A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate [[Hecate]]'s defensive aid.\" Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p126-127</ref> To commemorate the event the Byzantines erected a statue of [[Hecate]] ''lampadephoros'' (light-bearer or bringer). This story survived in the works of [[Hesychius of Miletus]], who in all probability lived in the time of [[Justinian I]]. His works survive only in fragments preserved in [[Photius]] and the tenth century lexicographer [[Suda|Suidas]]. The tale is also related by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]].\n\nDevotion to [[Hecate]] was especially favored by the Byzantines for her aid in having protected them from the incursions of Philip of Macedon. Her symbols were the crescent and star, and the walls of her city were her provenance.<ref>Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p15</ref>\n\nIt is unclear precisely how the symbol Hecate/Artemis, one of many goddesses<ref>\"In 324 Byzantium had a number of operative cults to traditional gods and goddesses tied to its very foundation eight hundred years before. Rhea, called \"the mother of the gods\" by Zosimus, had a well-ensconced cult in Byzantium from its very foundation. [...] Devotion to [[Hecate]] was especially favored by the Byzantines [...] Constantine would also have found Artemis-Selene and Aphrodite along with the banished Apollo Zeuxippus on the Acropolis in the old Greek section of the city. Other gods mentioned in the sources are Athena, Hera, Zeus, Hermes, and Demeter and Kore. Even evidence of Isis and Serapis appears from the Roman era on coins during the reign of Caracalla and from inscriptions.\" Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, p16</ref> would have been transferred to the city itself, but it seems likely to have been an effect of being credited with the intervention against Philip and the subsequent honors.  This was a common process in ancient Greece, as in ''Athens'' where the city was named after ''Athena'' in honor of such an intervention in time of war.\n\nLater, while under the Romans, cities in the [[Roman Empire]] often continued to issue their own coinage. \"Of the many themes that were used on local coinage, celestial and astral symbols often appeared, mostly stars or crescent moons.\"<ref>Michael R. Molnar, ''The Star of Bethlehem'', Rutgers University Press, 1999, p48</ref> The wide variety of these issues, and the varying explanations for the significance of the star and crescent on Roman coinage precludes their discussion here. It is, however, apparent that by the time of the Romans, coins featuring a star or crescent in some combination were not at all rare.\n\n==People==\n*[[Homerus of Byzantium|Homerus]], tragedian, lived in the early 3rd century BC\n*[[Philo of Byzantium|Philo]], engineer, lived ca. 280 BC\u2013ca. 220 BC\n*[[Epigenes of Byzantium]], astrologer, lived in the 3rd\u20132nd century BC\n*[[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], a scholar who flourished in [[Alexandria]], 3rd\u20132nd century BC\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constantinople]] details the history of the city before the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest of 1453]].\n* [[Istanbul]] details the history of the city from 1453 on, and describes the modern city.\n* [[Sarayburnu]] is the geographic location of ancient Byzantium.\n* [[Timeline of Istanbul history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = BYZANTIUM | last = Balcer | first = Jack Martin | authorlink = | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/byzantium-byzantion-contact-with-the-achaemenids-ca | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. IV, Fasc. 6 | pages = 599\u2013600 | location = | publisher = | year = 1990 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan, ''Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium'' (Hambledon/Continuum, London, 2007). {{ISBN|978-1-84725-179-4}}\n*Jeffreys, Elizabeth and Michael, and Moffatt, Ann, ''Byzantine Papers: Proceedings of the First Australian Byzantine Studies Conference, Canberra, 17\u201319 May 1978'' (Australian National University, Canberra, 1979).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205132031/http://www.istanbulinfolink.com/the_city/istanbul/history_1.htm Istanbul Historical Information - Istanbul Informative Guide To The City].

One of his intentions was therefore to get the whole of Berlin. However, this action had risks behind it. ''The risks that we are taking are justified.

These allowed visits by West Berliners, other West Germans, Western foreigners and Allied personnel into East Berlin, as well as visits by GDR citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into West Berlin, provided that they held the necessary permits. These crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it (East Germans, West Germans, West Berliners, other countries). The most famous was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] and Zimmerstra\u00dfe, also known as [[Checkpoint Charlie]], which was restricted to Allied personnel and foreigners.<ref name=\"harrison206\">{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|pp=206\u201314}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other border crossings existed between West Berlin and surrounding East Germany. These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany (Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]], Denmark), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's [[exclave]]s (see ''[[Steinst\u00fccken]]'').\n\nFour [[autobahn]]s connected West Berlin to West Germany, the most famous being the [[Bundesautobahn 2|Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn]], which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin. Access to West Berlin was also possible by railway (four routes) and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers.<ref name=\"thoughtco.com\"/><ref name=\"cnn.com\"/><ref name=\"history.howstuffworks.com\">https://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/berlin-wall1.htm</ref>\n\nNon-German Westerners could cross the border at [[Berlin Friedrichstra\u00dfe railway station|Friedrichstra\u00dfe station]] in East Berlin and at Checkpoint Charlie. When the Wall was erected, Berlin's complex public transit networks, the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] and [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]], were divided with it.<ref name = \"cgqmzv\"/> Some lines were cut in half; many stations were shut down. Three western lines traveled through brief sections of East Berlin territory, passing through eastern stations (called ''{{lang|de|Geisterbahnh\u00f6fe}},'' or [[ghost station]]s) without stopping. Both the eastern and western networks converged at {{lang|de|Friedrichstra\u00dfe}}, which became a major crossing point for those (mostly Westerners) with permission to cross.<ref name=\"history.howstuffworks.com\"/><ref name=\"mashable.com\">https://mashable.com/2014/11/06/berlin-wall-fence/#h6xI9DEA5PqH</ref>\n\n===Crossing===\n[[File:Berlin travel orders.png|thumb|Travel orders to go to Berlin as used by U.S. forces in the 1980s.]]\nWest Germans and citizens of other Western countries could generally visit East Germany, often after applying for a [[visa (document)|visa]]<ref name=willis>{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Jim|title=Daily Life behind the Iron Curtain|date=19 March 1946|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9780313397639|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-I99V70m0sC&pg=PT45&lpg=PT45&dq=visa+to+visit+west+germany+from+east#v=onepage&q=visa%20to%20visit%20west%20germany%20from%20east&f=false|accessdate=5 November 2014|ref=willis}}</ref> at an East German embassy several weeks in advance. Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nWest Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all \u2013 all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year ({{lang|de|Passierscheinregelung}}). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nIn 1971, with the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]], agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nEast Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the Wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:\n* Elderly pensioners could travel to the West starting in 1965\n* Visits of relatives for important family matters\n* People who had to travel to the West for professional reasons (for example, artists, truck drivers, musicians, writers, etc.){{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFor each of these exceptions, GDR citizens had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of [[East German Mark]]s into [[Deutsche Mark]]s (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (''[[Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsgeld]]'', or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nCitizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]] Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nThe Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the [[Military Liaison Missions]] accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in [[Potsdam]].<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:\n\n;Transit between West Germany and West Berlin:\n* '''Road:''' the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn (A2) (checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively). Soviet military personnel manned these checkpoints and processed Allied personnel for travel between the two points. Military personnel were required to be in uniform when traveling in this manner.\n* '''Rail:''' Western Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces were forbidden to use commercial train service between West Germany and West Berlin, because of GDR passport and customs controls when using them. Instead, the Allied forces operated a series of official (duty) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin. When transiting the GDR, the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee, just outside West Berlin. In addition to persons traveling on official business, authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space-available basis. The trains traveled only at night, and as with transit by car, Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/> (See [[History of the Berlin S-Bahn]].)\n\n;Entry into and exit from East Berlin:\n* [[Checkpoint Charlie]] (as a pedestrian or riding in a vehicle)\n\nAs with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.\n\nOrdinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstra\u00dfe train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\n===Defection attempts===\n{{further|List of deaths at the Berlin Wall}}\n[[File:East German Guard - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[National People's Army|NVA]] soldier [[Conrad Schumann]] [[defection|defecting]] to West Berlin during the Wall's early days in 1961.]]\nDuring the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin.

In an October 1973 order later discovered by researchers, guards were instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals and needed to be shot: \"Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used\".<ref name=\"BBCSept2007\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6943093.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2007 |quote=A newly discovered order is the firmest evidence yet that the [[communist regime]] gave explicit shoot-to-kill orders, says Germany's director of Stasi files. |title=E German 'licence to kill' found}}</ref>\n\nEarly successful escapes involved people jumping the initial barbed wire or leaping out of apartment windows along the line, but these ended as the Wall was fortified. East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up. On 15 August 1961, [[Conrad Schumann]] was the first East German border guard to escape by jumping the barbed wire to West Berlin.<ref>\"Conrad Schumann, 56, Symbol of E.

Engels stole a Soviet [[armored personnel carrier]] from a base where he was deployed and drove it right into the Wall. He was fired at and seriously wounded by border guards. But a West German policeman intervened, firing his weapon at the East German border guards.

He was shot and bled to death, in full view of the Western media, on 17 August 1962.

The speech is considered one of Kennedy's best, both a notable moment of the [[Cold War]] and a high point of the [[New Frontier]].

This time, however, the East German authorities allowed people to leave, provided that they did so by train through East Germany. This was followed by [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] within East Germany itself. Protest demonstrations spread throughout East Germany in September 1989. Initially, protesters were mostly people wanting to leave to the West, chanting {{lang|de|\"Wir wollen raus!\"}} (\"We want out!\"). Then protestors began to chant {{lang|de|\"Wir bleiben hier!\"}} (\"We are staying here!\"). This was the start of what East Germans generally call the \"[[Peaceful revolution (German)|Peaceful Revolution]]\" of late 1989.<ref name=\"unknown 2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mauerfall09.de |title=20 Jahre Mauerfall |accessdate=9 April 2009 | author=unknown | year=2009| publisher=Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH|language=de}}</ref> The protest demonstrations grew considerably by early November. The movement neared its height on 4 November, when half a million people gathered to demand political change, at the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]], East Berlin's large public square and transportation hub.<ref>Henslin, 07</ref>\n\nThe longtime leader of East Germany, [[Erich Honecker]], resigned on 18 October 1989 and was replaced by [[Egon Krenz]] that day. Honecker had predicted in January of that year that the Wall would stand for 50 or 100 more years<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>{{dead link|date=September 2018}} if the conditions that had caused its construction did not change.\n\nThe wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West kept increasing. By early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia, or via the West German Embassy in Prague. This was tolerated by the new Krenz government, because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. To ease the difficulties, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, travel.

As ARD and ZDF had broadcast to [[Tal der Ahnungslosen|nearly all of East Germany]] since the late 1950s and had become accepted by the East German authorities, the news was broadcast there as well simultaneously. Later that night, on ARD's ''[[Tagesthemen]]'', anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] proclaimed, \"This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone.

At first, they were ordered to find the \"more aggressive\" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany\u2014in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through \"as Schabowski said we can\".<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIt soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens.

Crowds gathered on both sides of the historic crossings waiting for hours to cheer the bulldozers that tore down portions of the Wall to reconnect the divided roads. While the Wall officially remained guarded at a decreasing intensity, new border crossings continued for some time, including the Brandenburg Gate on 22 December 1989.

From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Helligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until that December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7 million tonnes of building rubble was produced by the demolition. Unofficially, the demolition of the [[Bornholmer Stra\u00dfe]] began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and - after 3 October 1990 - 600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, 184&nbsp;km of wall, 154&nbsp;km border fence, 144&nbsp;km signal systems and 87&nbsp;km barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenberg border wall, completing the job in November 1991.

They belong to different families of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and can cover a wide range of musical roles. Since producing low pitches usually requires a long air column or string, the string and wind bass instruments are usually the largest instruments in their families or instrument classes. In musical compositions, such as [[song]]s and pieces, these are the lowest parts of the [[harmony]]. In [[choral music]] without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singers. In an [[orchestra]], the [[bassline]]s are played by the [[double bass]] and [[cello]]s, [[bassoon]] or [[contrabassoon]], low [[brass instrument|brass]] such as the [[tuba]] and [[bass trombone]], and the [[timpani]] (kettledrums). In many styles of [[traditional music]] such as [[Bluegrass (music)|Bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and in styles such as [[Rockabilly]] and [[Big Band]] and [[Bebop]] [[jazz]], the bass role is filled by the [[upright bass]]. In most [[rock music|rock]] and [[popular music|pop]] bands and in [[jazz fusion]] groups, the bass role is filled by the [[electric bass]]. In some 20th and 21st century pop genres, such as 1980s pop, [[hip hop music]] and [[Electronic Dance Music]], the bass role may be filled with a [[bass synthesizer]].\n\n==Musical role==\nWhen bass notes are played in a [[musical ensemble]] such an [[orchestra]], they are frequently used to provide a [[counterpoint]] or counter-[[melody]], in a [[harmony|harmonic]] context either to outline or juxtapose the progression of the [[chord (music)|chord]]s, or with [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] to underline the [[rhythm]]. In popular music, the bass part, which is called the \"[[bassline]]\", typically provides harmonic and rhythmic support to the band. The bass player is a member of the [[rhythm section]] in a band, along with the [[drum kit|drummer]], [[rhythm guitar]]ist, and, in some cases, a [[keyboard instrument]] player (e.g., [[piano]] or [[Hammond organ]]). The bass player usually plays the root or fifth of the chord (and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord) and accents the strong beats. \"The bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. It does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of a entire work.\"<ref>Cadwallader, Allen (1998). ''Analysis of Tonal Music: A Schenkerian Approach'', p. 45. {{ISBN|0195102320}}.</ref>\n\n==Kinds of bass harmony==\nIn [[classical music]], different forms of bass are: ''basso concertante'', or ''basso recitante''; the bass voice of the chorus; the bass which accompanies the softer passages of a composition, as well as those passages which employ the whole power of the ensemble, generally played by the [[violoncello]]s in orchestral music; ''contrabass'' (\u201cunder bass\u201d), is described as that part which is performed by the [[double bass]]es; violoncellos often play the same line an octave higher, or a different melodic or rhythmic part which is not a bassline when double basses are used; ''basso ripieno''; that bass which joins in the full passages of a composition, and, by its depth of tone and energy of stroke, affords a powerul contrast to the lighter and softer passages or movements.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Bass (music)}}</ref> [[Basso continuo]] was an approach to writing music during the [[Baroque music]] era (1600-1750).\n\n==Instruments==\nAs seen in the [[musical instrument classification]] article, categorizing instruments can be difficult. For example, some instruments fall into more than one category. The [[cello]] is considered a [[tenor]] instrument in some orchestral settings, but in a [[string quartet]] it is the bass instrument.\n\nExamples grouped by general form and playing technique include:\n*'''[[Double bass]]''' from the [[viol]] or violin family (usually the instrument referred to as a \"bass\" in [[European classical music]] and [[jazz]].

Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''[[Day beacon|daybeacon]]s''.\n\nHandheld beacons are also employed in [[aircraft marshalling]], and are used by the marshal to deliver instructions to the crew of aircraft as they move around an active airport, heliport or aircraft carrier.\n\n== For defensive communications ==\n[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|16th-century beacon hut in Culmstock, Devon, England]]\n\nClassically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]] and were part of a [[relay league]].\n\nSystems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. The ancient Romans used beacons and beacons figure on several occasions on the [[column of Trajan]].\n\nIn the 10th century, during the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] used a [[Byzantine beacon system|beacon system]] to transmit messages from the border with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], across [[Anatolia]] to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]] in the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. It was devised by [[Leo the Mathematician]] for Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, [[Michael III]].<ref name=\"ODB\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Foss | first = Clive | authorlink=  | title = Beacon | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |year=1991 | encyclopedia =[[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=273\u2013274}}</ref> Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the beacon system in Anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]].<ref name=\"ODB\" />\n\nIn Scandinavia many [[hill fort]]s were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In Finland, these beacons were called ''vainovalkeat'', \"persecution fires\", or ''vartiotulet'', \"guard fires\", and were used to warn Finn settlements of imminent raids by the Vikings.\n\nIn [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching English raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in England were named Beacon Hill after such beacons. In the [[Scottish border]]s country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]] and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network.<ref>Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, p. 53</ref> The [[Great Wall of China]] is also a beacon network.\n\nIn Spain, the border of [[Granada]] in the territory of the [[Crown of Castile]] had a complex beacon network to warn against Moorish raiders and military campaigns.<ref>Els almog\u00e1vers a la frontera amb el sarrains en el segle XIV.

[[Emergency vehicle]]s such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.\n\nThe color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, security personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with [[Automotive lamp types|halogen bulbs]] similar to those used in vehicle [[headlamp]]s, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Evaluation of Light-Emitting Diode Beacon Light Fixtures \n |journal=Lighting Research Center \u2013 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute \n |date=December 2009 \n |first=John \n |last=Bullough \n |author2=Nicholas P Skinner \n |id= \n |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2010-06-05 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729142629/https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-07-29 \n |df= \n}}</ref> Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle's engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.\n\n== Other uses ==\nBeacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events.\n\nThe Mishna describes a system of fire beacons used by the high court in [[Jerusalem]] to communicate the declaration of a new month to Jews in Israel and Babylon.<ref>Mishna Rosh Hashana 2:1-3</ref>\n\nBeacons have also allegedly been abused by [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]]. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground. There are, however, no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking.\n\nIn wireless networks, a [[Electric beacon#IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi beacons|beacon]] is a type of [[Frame (networking)|frame]] which is sent by the access point (or WiFi router) to indicate that it is on.\n\nBluetooth based beacons periodically send out a data packet and this could be used by software to identify the beacon location.

The new genre quickly became popular in Britain replacing Punjabi folk singers due to it being heavily influenced in Britain by the infusion of rock music and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive Punjabi folk music. It indicated the development of a self-conscious and distinctively rebellious [[British Asian]] [[youth culture]] centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with British culture and [[racism|racist]] elements in British society had resulted in [[Social alienation|alienation]] in many [[Minority group|minority ethnic groups]], fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for British Punjabi males to assert their masculinity.<ref name = \"htyxku\">Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\" In ''Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music''</ref><ref>[http://www.sehyon.com/bhangra.htm Sehyon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->], a composer of Bhangra music</ref><ref name=\"xucwva\">{{cite web|url=https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/sharma_noisy-asians.pdf|title=Moodle.brandeis.edu|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f2bb9fc-d03b-11da-b160-0000779e2340.html|title=Subscribe to read|website=www.ft.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, distributed by record labels such as [[Multitone Records]], Bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the UK, but no artists reached the Top 40 UK Chart despite these artists outselling popular British ones; most of the Bhangra cassette sales were not through the large UK record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the Official UK Charts Company for creating their rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dholclips.com|title=\u82b8\u80fd\u4eba\u611b\u7528\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30b3\u30f3\u7279\u96c6\u2503\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30bf\u30af\u30c8colors|website=www.dholclips.com}}</ref>\n\nThe group Alaap formed in 1977 co-founded by [[Channi Singh]] and Harjeet Gandhi both hail from [[Southall]], a Punjabi area in London.

The primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff, played out usually on a synthesizer, harmonium, accordion or a guitar.  The folk instruments were rarely used.\n\nOne of the biggest Bhangra stars of the last several decades is [[Malkit Singh]] and his band Golden Star. Singh was born in June 1963 in the village of [[Hussainpur]] in Punjab. He attended the [[Lyallpur Khalsa College]], [[Jalandhar]], in Punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree. There he met his mentor, Professor Inderjit Singh, who taught him Punjabi folk singing and Bhangra dancing. Due to Singh's tutelage, Malkit entered and won song contests during this time. In 1983, he won a gold medal at the [[Guru Nanak Dev University]] in [[Amritsar]], Punjab, for performing his song \"Gurh Nalon Ishq Mitha\", which later featured on his first album, ''Nach Gidhe Wich'', released in 1984. This album was created with the assistance of Bhangra musician, Tarlochan Singh Bilga. The band has toured 27 countries. Malkit has been awarded the MBE by the British Queen for his services to Bhangra music.\n\nBhangra boy band, the [[Sahotas]], composed of five brothers from [[Wolverhampton]]. Their music is a fusion of Bhangra, rock and dance.\n\n[[Heera Group UK|Heera]], formed by Bhupinder Bhindi and fronted by Kumar and Dhami, was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tM7vvmV1SWcC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=Heera,+formed+by+Bhupinder+Bhindi+and+fronted+by+Kumar+and+Dhami,+was+one+of+the+most+popular+bands+of+the+1980s&source=bl&ots=BgmRgZyy0q&sig=vY7-s5B0esU_ZPjs6un06QCT4JM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibxeOc-OXZAhXIL48KHQPuBcUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Heera,%20formed%20by%20Bhupinder%20Bhindi%20and%20fronted%20by%20Kumar%20and%20Dhami,%20was%20one%20of%20the%20most%20popular%20bands%20of%20the%201980s&f=false|title=Folk Dances of Punjab|last=Walia|first=Aarohi|date=2008|publisher=Unistar Books|isbn=9788171426027|language=en}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The group established itself with the albums ''Jag Wala Mela'', produced by [[Kuljit Bhamra]], and ''Diamonds from Heera'', produced by Deepak Khazanchi, on Arishma records. These albums are notable for being amongst the first Bhangra albums to mix Punjabi drums and Punjabi synthesizers with traditional British instruments successfully.\n\nBands like Alaap and Heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into Bhangra, because it enabled \"Asian youth to affirm their identities positively\" within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression. However, some believe that the progression of Bhangra music created an \"intermezzo culture\" post-India's partition, within the unitary definitions of Southeast Asians within the diaspora, thus \"establishing a brand new community in their home away from home\".<ref name=\"bdnvra\">Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\" In ''Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music'', ed.

Some Asian artists, such as [[Mick St Clair]], [[Bally Sagoo]], [[Talvin Singh]], Badmarsh, Black Star Liner are creating their own form of British [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\nThis era also brought about Bhangra art, which, like the Bhangra music it represented was rebellious.  Unlike folk music art, which consisted of a picture of the folk singer, Bhangra recordings had details such as distinctive artwork, logos, clever album names and band/musician listings (who played what).\n\n===Folk backlash===\nIn the mid 1990s, however, many artists returned to the original, traditional folk beats away from Bhangra music, often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi. This time also saw the rise of several young Punjabi folk singers as a backlash to Bhangra music.  They were aided by DJs who mixed hip hop samples with folk singing.\n\nBeginning around 1994, there was a trend towards the use of samples (often sampled from mainstream hip hop) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments, such as the tumbi and dhol.  Using folk instruments and hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from Punjab, Punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of Bhangra music.\n\nPioneering DJs instrumental in the decline of Bhangra were [[Mick St Clair]], [[Bally Sagoo]] and [[Panjabi MC]]. As DJs who were initially hired by Bhangra labels to remix the original recordings on the label's roster (OSA and Nachural respectively), they along with the record labels quickly found that remixing folk singers from India was much cheaper than working with outsourced Bhangra bands.\n\nA pioneering folk singer that was instrumental in Bhangra's demise was [[Jazzy B]], who debuted in 1992. Having sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, ''Folk and Funky'', he is now one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world, with a vocal style likened to that of [[Kuldip Manak]].\n\nOther influential folk artists include [[Surinder Shinda]] - famous for his \"Putt Jattan De\" - [[Harbhajan Mann]], [[Manmohan Waris]], Meshi Eshara, [[Sarbjit Cheema]], [[Hans Raj Hans]], [[Sardool Sikander]], Anakhi, Sat Rang, XLNC, [[B21 (band)|B21]], Shaktee, Sahara, [[Paaras]], PDM, Amar Group, Sangeet Group, and [[Bombay Talkie (band)|Bombay Talkie]]. Late Alam Lohar contributions of notably Jugni and Mirza Sahiban. A DJ to rise to stardom with many successful hits was Panjabi MC.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Bhangra music had largely declined and been replaced with Punjabi folk singers. The same folk singers which Bhangra bands had replaced a decade earlier were being utilized by DJs to make relatively inexpensive live music on laptops. This \"[[Folkhop]]\" genre was short lived as records could not be officially released due to nonclearance copyrights on samples used to create the \"beat\".  This continued until the end of the century. Folk-hop record labels such Hi-Tech were investigated by BPI (British Phonographic Industry) for copyright infringement by way of uncleared samples on releases by Folk DJs such as DJ Sanj.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/bpi-acts-after-sampling-complaints/027974|title=BPI acts after sampling complaints - News - Music Week|website=www.musicweek.com}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the decade, Bhangra continued to decline, with folk-hop artists such as Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian signing with international recording labels Sony and Island. Moreover, Multitone Records, one of the major recording labels associated with Bhangra in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, was bought by BMG. A recent{{when|date=July 2015}} [[Pepsi]] commercial launched in Britain featured South Asian actors and Punjabi folk music.\n\n===2000s remixes===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\nPunjabi folk remixed with hip-hop, known as [[Folkhop]], is most often produced when folk vocals are purchased online to be remixed in a studio. Folk vocals are usually sung to traditional melodies, that are often repeated with new lyrics.\n[[File:Hot seasons Punjabi Folk dance.webm|thumb|left|450px|Punjabi folk remixed]]\nSome South Asian DJs, especially in America, have mixed Punjabi folk music with house, [[reggae]], and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] to add a different flavor to Punjabi folk. These remixes continued to gain popularity as the 1990s came to an end. This movement was established and proliferated by DJs such as Mick St Clair, Punjabi MC and DJ Rekha. DJ Rekha, originally from the UK, now resides in New York City running a club event series called Basement Bhangra. These monthly events exhibit house and hip hop bhangra remixes.\n\nA notable remix artist is [[Bally Sagoo]], a Punjabi-Sikh, Anglo-Indian raised in [[Birmingham]], England. Sagoo described his music as \"a bit of tablas, a bit of the Indian sound. But bring on the bass lines, bring on the funky-drummer beat, bring on the [[James Brown]] samples\", to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1997. He was recently signed by [[Sony]]. [[Daler Mehndi]], a Punjabi singer from India has a type of music known as \"folk pop\". Mehndi has released tracks such as \"Bolo Ta Ra Ra\" and \"Ho Jayegee Balle Balle\". His song \"[[Tunak Tunak Tun]]\" was released in 1998.\n\n==Canada and the United States==\n[[File:MissPooja2.jpg|thumb|[[Miss Pooja]] famous for her numerous album releases ]]\n\nPunjabi immigrants have encouraged the growth of Punjabi folk music in the Western Hemisphere rather than Bhangra music. The Bhangra industry has grown in North America much less than in the United Kingdom. Indian Lion, a Canadian folk artist explains what he thinks has caused this:\n\n{{quote|The reason there's a lot of bands in England is because there's a lot of work in England.

Traditional Punjabi folk lyrics are generally more complex and often tell the tales of Punjabi history. There are many Bhangra songs devoted to Punjabi pride themes and Punjabi heroes. The lyrics are tributes to the cultural traditions of Punjab. In particular, many Bhangra tracks have been written about [[Udham Singh]] and [[Bhagat Singh]]. Less serious topics include beautiful women with their colourful [[Dupatta|duppattas]]. Lyrics can also be about crops and the coming of a new season.

[[Pandit Dinesh]] and [[Kuljit Bhamra]] were trained exponents of Indian percussion and helped create the current British music, mainly with tabla and dholki for bands like Alaap and [[Heera Group UK|Heera]].\n\n15-year-old percussionist Bhupinder Singh Kullar, a.k.a.

Songs such as \"Dhola veh Dhola\" (Satrang) and albums such as ''Bomb the Tumbi'' (Safri Boyz) contained this new style.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n[[Sunil Kalyan]] of [[Southall]], London, was a session musician on many songs and albums, playing the tabla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunilkalyan.com/|title=SunilKalyan.com Official site of the Bhangra percussion legend. Tabla, Dholak, Dhol and other percussion, Music Production & more! Southall, London.|website=sunilkalyan.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Sukhshinder Shinda]] later introduced his style of dhol playing with the album ''Dhol Beat''. He added a very clean style of dhol playing and helped create the sound for artists such as Jaswinder Singh Bains and [[Bhinda Jatt]].\n\nAnother notable{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} percussionist was [[:Parvinder Bharat]] [[:(Parv)]] of [[Wolverhampton]]. Parv had played for many bhangra bands from the 80's, playing with bands such as, Satrang, Pardesi and then eventually joining the internationally acclaimed DCS. After leaving DCS, Parv continued to experiment with his art which resulted in a European tour with none other than the legend that is Stevie Wonder.\n\n==Cultural impact and resurgence of Punjabi folk music in the West==\n\nThe third and fourth generation are generally unable to speak Punjabi if their parents could hardly speak it. There is a move towards [[Folk music of Punjab|Punjabi folk music]] which is the purest form of Punjabi music.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Much of the youth struggle to understand the lyrics, although, there are some children and young adults who have maintained their folk roots. Another reason why some fans express an anti-folk sentiment is that many folk songs were written for the dominate [[Jat people|Jatts]] clan whereas Sikhs don't believe in castes, so they disapproved of [[Folk music of Punjab|Punjabi folk music]]. However, today with artists like Tru-Skool, [[Jazzy B]], PMC, [[Sukhshinder Shinda]], Surinder Shinda, Pappi Gill, Nachattar Gill, Pammi Bai and [[Diljit Dosanjh]], Punjabi folk has increased in popularity although it is fused in some cases{{vague|date=November 2016}}. iTunes has catalogs of many Punjabi folk singers available.\n\nAnother cause of the resurgence of Punjabi folk music is due to the increased popularity of Bhangra in areas like the U.K. Canada and U.S.A. Bhangra has become more accessible through social media platforms i.e. youtube and Instagram, for the younger generation. In addition, multiple universities, across the UK, USA, and Canada, have teams as well as academies being set up by senior dancers separate from universities. This resurgence has led to a desire for more traditional folk songs and beats, but also a learning opportunity for kids of their cultures.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Music of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Asian Underground]]\n*[[Multitone records]]\n*[[List of bhangra artists]]\n*[[Dhol]]\n*[[Music of Punjab]]\n*[[Punjab region]]\n*[[Punjabi culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bhangra}}\n*[http://www.gabroo.tv Where Bhangra Lives]\n*[http://www.simplybhangra.com Bhangra News, Music Videos & Interviews]\n*[http://www.bhangra.org www.Bhangra.org]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090913221449/http://houseofbhangra.co.uk/ House Of Bhangra]\n*[http://www.realbhangra.com Real Bhangra]\n*[http://www.desiblock.com Punjabi Video Songs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023931/http://www.indiamusic.com/ India Music - The first ever Indian Music domain and web site registered.]\n{{Punjab, India}}\n\n[[Category:Punjabi music]]\n[[Category:Indian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Pakistani styles of music]]\n[[Category:Punjabi words and phrases]]\n[[Category:British culture]]\n[[Category:Indian diaspora in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Pakistani diaspora in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Dance music]]\n[[Category:Bhangra (music)| ]]\n[[Category:Punjabi diaspora]]", "sha1": "3fk8istg1tpsem6gavhd0w9plk8jdec"}}, {"title": "Beastie Boys", "ns": "0", "id": "3735", "revision": {"id": "866685701", "parentid": "866684733", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T21:56:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "THX1136", "id": "18985517"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* 1997\u20132001: Hello Nasty */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2017}}\n{{Use American English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Beastie Boys\n| background      = group_or_band\n| image           = Beastie Boys 2009 (6184423405).jpg\n| image_size      = 290\n| landscape       = yes\n| alt             = A group of three men on a stairwell behind a light background\n| caption         = The Beastie Boys in 2009; from left to right: [[Ad-Rock]], [[Adam Yauch|MCA]] and [[Mike D]]\n| origin          = [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], U.S.\n| genre           = {{flatlist|\n* [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]\n* [[rap rock]]\n* {{nowrap|[[alternative hip hop]]}}\n* [[hardcore punk]] \n}}\n| years_active    = {{Start date|1981}}\u2013{{End date|2012}}<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Gordon |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/55404-mike-d-says-beastie-boys-wont-be-making-any-more-music/ |title=Mike D Says Beastie Boys Won't Be Making Any More Music |publisher=Pitchfork.com |date=June 2, 2014 |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604090323/http://pitchfork.com/news/55404-mike-d-says-beastie-boys-wont-be-making-any-more-music/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n| label           = {{flatlist|\n* [[Rat Cage Records|Rat Cage]]\n* [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]]\n* [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]\n* {{nowrap|[[Grand Royal]]}}\n}}\n| associated_acts = {{flatlist|\n* [[Rick Rubin]]\n* [[Run-DMC]]\n* [[Dust Brothers]]\n* [[Mario Caldato Jr.]]\n* [[LL Cool J]]\n* [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]\n* [[Kurtis Blow]]\n* [[The Fat Boys]]\n* [[Luscious Jackson]]\n* [[Whodini]]\n* [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\n* [[Biz Markie]]\n* [[Nas]]\n}}\n| website         = {{URL|beastieboys.com}}\n| past_members = <!--Members are to be listed first by order of which they joined the band (Ad-Rock comes last as non-founding member) and then alphabetically surname, as per Wikipedia guidelines.-->\n* [[John Berry (musician)|John Berry]]\n* [[Mike D|Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond]]\n* [[Kate Schellenbach]]\n* [[Adam Yauch|Adam \"MCA\" Yauch]]\n* [[Ad-Rock|Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Beastie Boys''' were an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group from New York City formed in 1981.

Diamond]]''. In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling [[James Newton]]'s \"Choir\" in their track, \"Pass the Mic\". The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song \"Choir\". In the decision, the judge found that:\n\n{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newton v.

The [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the [[British Empire]] and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the dispersal of some of the islands' population and culture throughout the world, and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with six counties remaining in the UK as [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nThe term \"British Isles\" is [[British Isles naming dispute|controversial]] in Ireland,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rasBRQwwOIIC&pg=PA7 Social work in the British Isles by Malcolm Payne, Steven Shardlow] When we think about social work in the British Isles, a contentious term if ever there was one, what do we expect to see?</ref> where there are nationalist objections to its usage.<ref name=\"postwarculture\">{{Citation|first1=Alistair|last1=Davies|first2=Alan|last2=Sinfield|title=British Culture of the Postwar: An Introduction to Literature and Society, 1945\u20131999|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-12811-0|page=9|quote=Some of the Irish dislike the 'British' in 'British Isles', while a minority of the Welsh and Scottish are not keen on 'Great Britain'. ...

Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern [[European mainland]]. There are however, fewer numbers of [[species]], with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular.

Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state [[Afforestation|forestation programmes]]. Almost all land outside urban areas is [[Arable land|farmland]]. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. [[Oak]], [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[beech]] are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, [[pine]] and [[birch]] are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of [[grass]]es and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and [[marsh]]es host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].\n\nMany larger animals, such as [[wolf]], bear and the European [[moose|elk]] are today extinct. However, some species such as [[red deer]] are protected. Other small mammals, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]] have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the [[common chaffinch]], [[common blackbird]], [[house sparrow]] and [[common starling]]; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[perch]] and [[Esox|pike]]. Sea fish include [[Squalidae|dogfish]], [[cod]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[pollock]] and [[Bass (fish)|bass]], as well as [[mussels]], crab and [[oysters]] along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nFew species of [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]] are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three [[snakes]] are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with [[weasels]], [[European polecat|polecat]]s, [[wildcats]], most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and [[common toad]]s also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of [[woodlouse]] native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\n\nDomestic animals include the [[Connemara pony]], [[Shetland pony]], [[English Mastiff]], [[Irish wolfhound]] and many varieties of [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km\u00b2 of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]\n\nEngland has a generally high population density, with almost 80% of the total population of the islands.

Ireland for most of its history had much the same population density as Great Britain (about one third of the total population). However, since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an [[Irish diaspora]] that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.\n\nThe linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich,<ref>{{Citation|title=Languages of the British Isles Past and Present|isbn=0-233-96666-8|author=WB Lockwood|publisher=Ladysmith|location=British Columbia|year=1975|quote=An introduction to the rich linguistic heritage of Great Britain and Ireland.}}</ref> with twelve languages from six groups across four branches of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Language family|family]].

Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\n\nAt the time of the [[Roman Empire]], about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic dialects]] of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as [[Gaels|Hiberni]], the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as [[Picts]] and the southern two thirds by [[Britons (historical)|Britons]].\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|The [[Alfred Jewel]] (9th century)]]\n[[Anglo-Saxons]] arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being [[History of Ireland (400\u2013800)#Ecclesiastical history|Christianised]]\u2014traditionally by the Romano-Briton, [[Saint Patrick]]. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entered a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]] (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of [[monasteries]] and [[universities]]. These were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of a similar nature.\n\n[[Viking]] invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the [[Channel Islands]] to this day.  A century later, the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], a provincial king, and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of [[King of England]] and [[Lord of Ireland]] became entwined in one person.\n\n[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|left|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]\n\nBy the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.\n\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a [[revolutionary republic]] in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\n\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with the six counties that formed [[Northern Ireland]] remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main article|Politics in the British Isles}}\n{{See also|Ireland\u2013United Kingdom relations|Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland\u2013Isle of Man relations|Politics of the Isle of Man|Politics of Jersey|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Alderney|Politics of Sark|}}\n\n[[File:British Isles terms.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Subdivisions of the British Isles<br>See also [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_13.svg diagrammatic version]]]\n\nThere are two [[sovereign state]]s in the isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called ''the Republic of Ireland'', governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming [[Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply ''the United Kingdom'', which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name=\"gov.je\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Counties of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and [[Northern Ireland]] in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have \"[[Devolution|devolved]]\" governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For [[judicial]] purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[English law|England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\n\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[member of parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].\n\nIreland and the United Kingdom are both part of the European Union (EU). The Crown dependencies are not a part of the EU, but do participate in certain aspects that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU.<ref name=\"gov.je\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union \u2013 Isle of Man Government \u2013 Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925081145/http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the [[Schengen Area]], that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union, and is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\".<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole\u2014for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112024357/http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland peace process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland.

The [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ({{lang-ga|Tion\u00f3l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h\u00c9ireann}}) predates the British\u2013Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).\n\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\n\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including [[History of golf|golf]], [[History of association football|association football]], [[History of cricket|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and [[darts]], as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is [[association football]]. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]].

Linguistically, Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a [[language isolate]] to any other known living language. The Basques are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit, the Basque Country. The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% (751,500) of Basques in all territories. Of these, 93.2% (700,300) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% (51,200) are in the French portion.<ref name=inkesta2016/>\n\nNative speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the [[French Basque Country|three \"ancient provinces\"]] in France. [[Gipuzkoa]], most of [[Biscay]], a few municipalities of [[\u00c1lava]], and the northern area of [[Navarre]] formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of \u00c1lava, the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish, either because Basque [[Language shift|was replaced]] by Spanish over the centuries, in some areas (most of \u00c1lava and central Navarre), or because it was possibly never spoken there, in other areas (parts of the [[Enkarterri]] and southeastern Navarre).\n\nUnder [[Restoration (Spain)|Restorationist]] and [[Francoist Spain]], public use of Basque was frowned upon, often regarded as a sign of [[Basque separatism|separatism]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Francisco Franco|url=http://www.history.com/topics/francisco-franco}}</ref> this applied especially to those regions that did not support Franco's uprising (such as Biscay or Gipuzkoa).

They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used\u2014and easily understood by all Basque speakers\u2014in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies from region to region and from school to school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consejoescolar.educacion.navarra.es/attachments/article/368/Informe%20del%20Sistema%20Educativo%20en%20Navarra%202011-2012.pdf |title=Navarrese Educational System.

The [[origin of the Basques]] and of their languages is not conclusively known, though the most accepted current theory is that early forms of Basque developed prior to the arrival of [[Indo-European languages]] in the area, including the [[Romance languages]] that geographically surround the Basque-speaking region. Basque has adopted a good deal of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.\n\nThe [[Basque alphabet]] uses the [[Latin script]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Names of the language==\n{{See also|Basques#Etymology of the word Basque}}\nIn Basque, the name of the language is officially ''Euskara'' (alongside various [[Basque dialects#Dialectal divergence|dialect]] forms).\n\nIn French, the language is normally called ''basque'', though in recent times ''euskara'' has become common. Spanish has a greater variety of names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as ''el vasco'', ''la lengua vasca'', or ''el euskera''. Both terms, ''vasco'' and ''basque'', are inherited from Latin [[ethnonym]] ''[[Vascones]]'', which in turn goes back to the Greek term \u03bf\u1f50\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (''ouask\u014dnous''), an ethnonym used by [[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (23 CE, Book III).<ref name=Trask>[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish term ''Vascuence'', derived from Latin ''vascon\u012dce'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=vascuence|title=Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola|publisher=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|accessdate=22 November 2008}}</ref> has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well-liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in [[Huesca]] in 1349 stated that ''Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercader\u00eda ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en '''basquen\u00e7''': et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol''\u2014essentially penalising the use of Arabic, Hebrew, or Basque in marketplaces with a fine of 30 [[Solidus (coin)|sols]] (the equivalent of 30 sheep).<ref>O'Callaghan, J. ''A History of Medieval Spain'' (1983) Cornell Press {{ISBN|978-0801492648}}</ref>\n\n==History and classification==\n{{main|History of the Basque language}}\nBasque is geographically surrounded by [[Romance languages]] but is a [[language isolate]] unrelated to them, and indeed, to any other language in the world. It is the last remaining descendant of one of the [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of Western Europe, the others being extinct outright.<ref name=\"Trask\"/> Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the traditional [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins, but an early form of the Basque language likely was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.\n\nAuthors such as [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] have noted that the words for \"knife\" (''aizto''), \"axe\" (''aizkora''), and \"hoe\" (''aitzur'') derive from the word for \"stone\" (''haitz''), and have therefore concluded that the language dates to [[prehistoric Europe]] when those tools were made of stone.<ref>''Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society'', volumes 52\u201356 (1942), page 90</ref><ref>Kelly Lipscomb, ''Spain'' (2005), page 457</ref> Others find this unlikely: see [[Origin of the Basques#The aizkora controversy|the ''aizkora'' controversy]].\n\nLatin inscriptions in [[Gallia Aquitania]] preserve a number of words with [[cognate]]s in the reconstructed [[proto-Basque language]], for instance, the personal names ''Nescato'' and ''Cison'' (''neskato'' and ''gizon'' mean \"young girl\" and \"man\", respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the [[Roman Republic]]'s conquests in the western [[Pyrenees]]. Some authors even argue for [[late Basquisation]], that the language moved westward during [[Late Antiquity]] after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire ]] into the northern part of [[Hispania]] into what is now [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].<ref name=\"Trask\"/>\n\nRoman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] and [[Tartessian language]]s became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later [[Gascon language|Gascon]] (a branch of [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) in the northeast, [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the southeast and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the southwest.\n\n===Hypotheses concerning Basque's connections to other languages===\nThe statistical improbability and chronological difficulty of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many [[pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. Almost all hypotheses concerning the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are:\n* [[Iberian language|Iberian]]: another ancient language once spoken in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], shows several similarities with [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and Basque. However, not enough evidence exists to distinguish geographical connections from linguistic ones. Iberian itself remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]].

Pokorny, P. Kretschmer and several other linguists encompasses the Basco-Iberian hypothesis.\n* [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: Linking Basque to the [[Kartvelian languages]] is now widely discredited. The hypothesis was inspired by the existence of the ancient [[Kingdom of Iberia]] in the [[Caucasus]] and further by some typological similarities between the two languages.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hualde, Joseba Lakarra, Robert Lawrence Trask (1995), ''Towards a history of the Basque language'', p. 81.

The Basque language became the main everyday language, {{Where|date=January 2013}} while other languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[French language|French]], or [[Latin]] were preferred for the administration and high education.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the southern part of Navarre, the southwestern part of [[\u00c1lava]], and the western part of Biscay, and including some parts of [[B\u00e9arn]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|location=Zarautz (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1|page=17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of \u00c1lava\u2014including its capital city [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=Arabako euskara|year=2012|publisher=Elkar|location=Andoain (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-15337-72-0|page=21}}</ref>\u2014and a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces, Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed its border northwards. In the [[French Basque Country]], Basque was still spoken in all the territory except in [[Bayonne]] and some villages around, and including some bordering towns in [[B\u00e9arn]].\n\nIn the 20th century, however, the rise of [[Basque nationalism]] spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments in the [[Southern Basque Country]], it has recently made a modest comeback. In the Spanish part, Basque-language schools for children and Basque-teaching centres for adults have brought the language to areas such as [[Enkarterri]] and the [[Ribera d'Ebre]] in Navarre, where it is not known if it has ever been spoken before; and in the French Basque Country, these schools and centres have almost stopped the decline of the language.\n\n===Official status===\n[[File:Navarra - Zonificacion linguistica.png|thumb|Official status of the Basque language in Navarre]]\nHistorically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region. However, Basque was explicitly recognised in some areas. For instance, the ''[[fuero]]'' or charter of the Basque-colonised [[Ojacastro]] (now in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the [[13th century|13th]] and [[14th century|14th]] centuries.\n\nThe [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] states in Article 3 that the [[Spanish language]] is the official language of the nation, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other [[languages of Spain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#I2 |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Spanish Constitutional Court |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620064544/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#I2 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The Statute of Navarre establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre, but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the French Basque Country and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognised on the other side of the border.\n\nThe positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre.

Substrate theories are often difficult to prove (especially in the case of phonetically plausible changes like /f/ to /h/). As a result, although many arguments have been made on both sides, the debate largely comes down to the a priori tendency on the part of particular linguists to accept or reject substrate arguments.\n\nExamples of arguments against the substrate theory,<ref name=Trask/> and possible responses:\n# Spanish did not fully shift {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}, instead, it has preserved {{IPA|/f/}} before consonants such as {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/\u027e/}} (cf ''fuerte'', ''frente''). (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|[f]}} in these words might be a secondary development from an earlier sound such as {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[\u0278]}} and learned words (or words influenced by written Latin form). Gascon does have {{IPA|/h/}} in these words, which might reflect the original situation.)\n# Evidence of Arabic loanwords in Castilian points to {{IPA|/f/}} continuing to exist long after a Basque substrate might have had any effect on Castilian. (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|/f/}} in these words might be a late development.  Many languages have come to accept new phonemes from other languages after a period of significant influence.  For example, French lost /h/ but later regained it as a result of Germanic influence, and has recently gained {{IPA|/\u014b/}} as a result of English influence.)\n# Basque regularly developed Latin {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/b/}}.\n# The same change also occurs in parts of Sardinia, Italy and the Romance languages of the Balkans where no Basque substrate can be reasonably argued for. (On the other hand, the fact that the same change might have occurred elsewhere independently does not disprove substrate influence. Furthermore, parts of [[Sardinia]] also have prothetic /a/ or /e/ before initial /r/, just as in Basque and Gascon, which may actually argue for some type of influence between both areas.)\n\nBeyond these arguments, a number of [[nomadic]] groups of Castile are also said to use or have used Basque words in their jargon, such as the [[gacer\u00eda]] in [[Segovia (province)|Segovia]], the [[minga\u00f1a]], the Galician [[fala dos arxinas]]<ref>Varela Pose, F.J.

The subject of an [[intransitive verb]] is in the [[absolutive case]] (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the [[ergative case]] (shown by the suffix ''-k''). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.\n\nThe [[auxiliary verb]], which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this [[polypersonal agreement]] is found only in Basque, some [[languages of the Caucasus]], [[Mordvinic languages]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] (all non-Indo-European). The ergative\u2013absolutive alignment is also rare among European languages\u2014occurring only in some languages of the Caucasus\u2014but not infrequent worldwide.\n\nConsider the phrase:\n\n:''{{Audio|martinek1.ogg|Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.}}''\n:{{interlinear|lang=eu\n|Martin-ek egunkari-ak erosten di-zki-t\n|Martin-ERG newspaper-PL buy-GER AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO[(s)he/it_SBJ]\n|\"Martin buys the newspapers for me.\" }}\n\n''Martin-ek'' is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending ''-k'' (with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-e-''). ''Egunkariak'' has an ''-ak'' ending, which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is ''erosten dizkit'', in which ''erosten'' is a kind of gerund (\"buying\") and the auxiliary ''dizkit'' means \"he/she (does) them for me\". This ''dizkit'' can be split like this:\n* ''di-'' is used in the present tense when the verb has a subject (ergative), a direct object (absolutive), and an indirect object, and the object is him/her/it/them.\n* ''-zki-'' means the absolutive (in this case the newspapers) is plural, if it were singular there would be no infix; and\n* ''-t'' or '-da-' means \"to me/for me\" (indirect object).\n* in this instance there is no suffix after ''-t''. A zero suffix in this position indicates that the ergative (the subject) is third person singular (he/she/it).\n\nThe phrase \"you buy the newspapers for me\" would translate as:\n\n:''{{Audio|Zuekegunkariak.ogg|Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue}}''\n:{{interlinear|lang=eu\n|Zu-ek egunkari-ak erosten di-zki-da-zue\n|you-ERG newspaper-PL buy-GER AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO-you(pl.).SBJ\n|}}\n\nThe auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'\n* ''di-'' indicates that the main verb is transitive and in the present tense\n* ''-zki-'' indicates that the direct object is plural\n* ''-da-'' indicates that the indirect object is me (to me/for me; -t becomes -da- when not final)\n* ''-zue'' indicates that the subject is you (plural)\n\nThe pronoun ''zuek'' 'you (plural)' has the same form both in the nominative or absolutive case (the subject of an intransitive sentence or direct object of a transitive sentence) and in the ergative case (the subject of a transitive sentence). In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant, e.g. ''dizkidazue'' in ''zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue'' 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped, e.g. ''zuek'' in ''egunkariak erosten dizkidazue'' 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: ''egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue'' 'it is you (pl.) who buys the newspapers for me', or ''egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue'' 'it is me for whom you buy the newspapers'.\n\nModern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a ''nor'' (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori'' (absolutive\u2013dative) paradigm, as in the sentence ''Aititeri txapela erori zaio'' (\"The hat fell from grandfather['s head]\").<ref>[http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut (Basque) INFLECTION \u00a71.4.2.2. Potential paradigms: absolutive and dative.]</ref> Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for antipassive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned (notice that Basque lacks a passive voice, and displays instead an [[antipassive voice]] paradigm), and also has a ''nor-nork'' (absolutive\u2013ergative) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori-nork'' (absolutive\u2013dative\u2013ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the ''dizkidazue'' example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of ''nor-nori-nork'' in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. The most ubiquitous auxiliary, ''izan,'' can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.\n\nThere are more persons in the singular (5) than in the [[plural]] (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons\u2014[[T\u2013V distinction|informal]] masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun ''hi'' is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a ''-k'', the feminine uses an ''-n.'' This is a property rarely found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for \"listener\" (the [[allocutive]]) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation calls for the familiar masculine, the form is augmented and modified accordingly. Likewise for the familiar feminine.\n(''Gizon bat etorri da'', \"a man has come\"; ''gizon bat etorri duk'', \"a man has come [you are a male close friend]\", ''gizon bat etorri dun'', \"a man has come [you are a female close friend]\", ''gizon bat etorri duzu'', \"a man has come [I talk to you (Sir / Madam)]\")<ref name=\"hitano\">[http://www.hiru.com/es/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aspecto, tiempo y modo] in Spanish, [http://www.hiru.com/eu/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aditzen aspektua, tempusa eta modua]{{dead link|date=March 2013}} in Basque.</ref>\nNotice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong, since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it was originally the second person plural, later came to be used as a formal singular, and then later still the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.\n\nAll the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms in total, called [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: perfect (various suffixes), habitual<ref name=\"ARKing\">{{cite book |last=King |first=Alan R. |year=1994 |title=The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction |page=393 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |isbn=0-87417-155-5}}</ref> (suffix ''-t[z]en''), and future/potential (suffix. ''-ko/-go''). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix ''-tu'' in the perfect, adapted from the Latin perfect passive ''-tus'' suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.\n\nWithin a verb phrase, the periphrastic verb comes first, followed by the auxiliary.\n\nA Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number (indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural: ''euskaldun'' [Basque speaker], ''euskalduna'' [the Basque speaker, a Basque speaker], ''euskaldunak'' [Basque speakers, the Basque speakers], and ''euskaldunok'' [we Basque speakers, those Basque speakers]). These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again.  It has been estimated that, with two levels of [[recursion]], a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.<ref>[Agirre et al., 1992]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Word\n!Case\n!Result\n!meaning\n|-\n|etxe\n|\n|etxe\n|house\n|-\n|etxe\n|a\n|etxea\n|the house\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak\n|etxeak\n|the houses\n|-\n|etxe\n|a + ra\n|etxera\n|to the house\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak + ra\n|etxeetara\n|to the houses\n|-\n|etxe\n|a + tik\n|etxetik\n|from the house\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak + tik\n|etxeetatik\n|from the houses\n|-\n|etxe\n|a + (r)aino\n|etxeraino\n|until the house\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak + (r)aino\n|etxeetaraino\n|until the houses\n|-\n|etxe\n|a + n\n|etxean\n|in the house\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak + n\n|etxeetan\n|in the houses\n|-\n|etxe\n|a + ko\n|etxeko\n|of the house (belonging to)\n|-\n|etxe\n|ak + ko\n|etxeetako\n|of the houses (belonging to)\n|}\n\nWhen we use cases with a proper name \"Mikel\" (Michael)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Word\n!Case\n!Result\n!meaning\n|-\n|Mikel\n|(r)en\n|Mikelen\n|of Mikel\n|-\n|Mikel\n|(r)engana\n|Mikelengana\n|to Mikel\n|-\n|Mikel\n|(e)kin\n|Mikelekin\n|with Mikel\n|}\n\nWithin a noun phrase, modifying adjectives follow the noun.

The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic\u2013focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] is stated first, then the [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, ''What is this?'' can be translated as ''Zer da hau?'' or ''Hau zer da?'', but in both cases the question tag ''zer'' immediately precedes the verb ''da''. This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word ''galdegai'' (focus) is used.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle ''ez'' must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: ''Aitak frantsesa irakasten du,'' \"Father teaches French,\" in the negative becomes ''Aitak ez du frantsesa irakasten,'' in which ''irakasten'' (\"teaching\") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Central vowel|Central]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|i<br>{{IPAslink|i}} || || u<br>{{IPAslink|u}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|e<br>{{IPAslink|e\u031e|e}} || || o<br>{{IPAslink|o\u031e|o}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n| || a<br>{{IPAslink|\u00e4|a}} ||\n|}\nThe Basque language features five vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ (the same that are found in [[Spanish phonology#Vowels|Spanish]], [[Asturian language#Vowels|Asturian]] and [[Aragonese language#Vowels|Aragonese]]).

With the laminal alveolar fricative {{IPA-eu|s\u033b|}}, the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth.  This is the usual {{IPA|/s/}} in most European languages. It is written with an orthographic {{angbr|z}}. By contrast, the [[voiceless apicoalveolar fricative]] {{IPA-eu|s\u033a|}} is written {{angbr|s}}; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth and friction occurs at the tip (apex). For example, ''zu'' \"you\" (singular, respectful) is distinguished from ''su'' \"fire\". The affricate counterparts are written {{angbr|tz}} and {{angbr|ts}}. So, ''etzi'' \"the day after tomorrow\" is distinguished from ''etsi'' \"to give up\"; ''atzo'' \"yesterday\" is distinguished from ''atso'' \"old woman\".\n\nIn the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical {{angbr|s}} and the alveolar affricate {{angbr|tz}} are used.\n\nBasque also features postalveolar sibilants ({{IPA|/\u0283/}}, written {{angbr|x}}, and {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, written {{angbr|tx}}), sounding like English ''sh'' and ''ch''.\n\nThere are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and [[motherese]] (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, ''tanta'' \"drop\" vs. ''ttantta'' {{IPA|/canca/}} \"droplet\". A few common words, such as ''txakur'' {{IPA|/t\u0283akur/}} \"dog\", use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: ''zakur''\u2014\"big dog\". Many  Basque dialects exhibit a derived palatalisation effect, in which coronal onset consonants change into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the {{IPA|/n/}} in ''egin'' \"to act\" becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: {{IPA|/e\u0261ina/}} = {{IPA|[e\u0261i\u0272a]}} \"the action\", {{IPA|/e\u0261ines/}} = {{IPA|[e\u0261i\u0272es]}} \"doing\".\n\n[[File:Diaphonej.svg|thumb|Regional realisations of {{Angbr|j}}]]\nThe letter {{angbr|j}} has a variety of realisations according to the regional dialect: {{IPA|[j, d\u0292, x, \u0283, \u025f, \u029d]}}, as pronounced from west to east in south Bizkaia and coastal Lapurdi, central Bizkaia, east Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, south Navarre, inland Lapurdi and Low Navarre, and Zuberoa, respectively.<ref>Trask, R.

In older loans, initial ''r-'' took a [[Prothesis (linguistics)|prosthetic]] ''e-'', resulting in ''err-'' (''Erroma'' \"Rome\", ''Errusia'' \"Russia\"), more rarely ''irr-'' (for example ''irratia'' \"radio\", ''irrisa'' \"rice\").\n\n===Stress and pitch===\n{{main|Pitch-accent language#Basque}}\nBasque features great dialectal variation in accentuation, from a weak [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] in the western dialects to a marked stress in central and eastern dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement.<ref>Hualde, J.I. (1986), [http://www.ehu.eus/ojs/index.php/ASJU/article/viewFile/7813/7007 \"Tone and Stress in Basque: A Preliminary Survey\"]. ''Anuario del Seminario Julio de Urquijo'' XX-3, 1986, pp. 867-896.</ref> Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms), e.g. ''bas\u00f3\u00e0'' (\"the forest\", absolutive case) vs. ''b\u00e1so\u00e0'' (\"the glass\", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish ''vaso''); ''bas\u00f3\u00e0k'' (\"the forest\", ergative case) vs. ''b\u00e1so\u00e0k'' (\"the glass\", ergative case) vs. ''b\u00e1soak'' (\"the forests\" or \"the glasses\", absolutive case).\n\nGiven its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard [[orthography]] and [[Euskaltzaindia]] (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a [[Syntagmatic structure|syntagma]], and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.\n\nThis scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} that differentiates its sound from the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodical]] patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some ''Euskaldun berriak'' (\"new Basque-speakers\", i.e. second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, e.g. pronouncing ''nire ama'' (\"my mum\") as ''nire \u00e1ma'' (\u2013 \u2013 \u00b4 \u2013), instead of as ''nir\u00e9 am\u00e0'' (\u2013 \u00b4 \u2013 `).\n\n===Morphophonology===\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nThe combining forms of nominals in final /-u/ vary across the regions of the Basque Country.  The /u/ can stay unchanged, be lowered to an /a/, or it can be lost. Loss is most common in the east, while lowering is most common in the west. For instance, ''buru'', \"head\", has the combining forms ''buru-'' and ''bur-'', as in ''buruko'', \"cap\", and ''burko'', \"pillow\", whereas ''katu'', \"cat\", has the combining form ''kata-'', as in ''katakume'', \"kitten\". Michelena suggests that the lowering to /a/ is generalised from cases of Romance borrowings in Basque that retained Romance stem alternations, such as ''kantu'', \"song\" with combining form ''kanta-'', borrowed from Romance ''canto'', ''canta-''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Basque Phonology|last=Hualde|first=Jose Ignacio|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1991|isbn=978-0-415-05655-7|location=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThrough contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Gascon language|Gascon]], among other languages. There are a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: ''lore'' (\"flower\", from ''florem''), ''errota'' (\"mill\", from ''rotam'', \"[mill] wheel\"), ''gela'' (\"room\", from ''cellam''), ''gauza'' (\"thing\", from ''causa'').\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Basque alphabet}}\n[[File:Ascain St\u00e8le disco\u00efdale.jpg|thumb|An example of Basque lettering in a funerary stela.]]\nBasque is written using the [[Latin script]] including ''[[\u00f1]]'' and sometimes ''[[\u00e7]]'' and ''[[\u00fc]]''. Basque does not use ''Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy '' for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by [[Euskaltzaindia]]) does include them for loanwords:<ref>[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/arauak/dok/Araua_0017.pdf Basque alphabet]</ref>\n: Aa Bb Cc (and, as a variant, \u00c7\u00e7) Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn \u00d1\u00f1 Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz\n\nThe phonetically meaningful [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''dd, ll, [[rr (digraph)|rr]], ts, tt, tx, tz'' are treated as pairs of letters.\n\nAll letters and digraphs represent unique [[phoneme]]s. The main exception is when ''l'' and ''n'' are preceded by ''i'', that in most dialects palatalises their sound into /[[\u028e]]/ and /[[\u0272]]/, even if these are not written. Hence, ''[[Ikurri\u00f1a]]'' can also be written ''Ikurrina'' without changing the sound, whereas the proper name ''Ainhoa'' requires the mute ''h'' to break the palatalisation of the ''n''.\n\n''H'' is mute in most regions, but it is pronounced in many places in the northeast, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.\nIts acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardisation process because the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.\n\n[[File:Basquefontsample.png|thumb|left|The letters of the alphabet in a Basque style font.]]\nIn [[Sabino Arana]]'s (1865\u20131903) alphabet,<ref name=\"Arana\">''Lecciones de ortograf\u00eda del euskera bizkaino'', Arana eta Goiri'tar Sabin, Bilbao, Bizkaya'ren Edestija ta Izkerea Pizkundia, 1896 (Sebasti\u00e1n de Amorrortu).</ref> digraphs {{Angle bracket|ll}} and {{Angle bracket|rr}} were replaced with ''[[\u013a]]'' and ''[[\u0155]]'', respectively.\n\nA typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.\nIt derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterised by thick [[serif]]s.\n\n===Number system used by millers===\n[[File:Errotarienzenbakiak.jpg|thumb|An example of the number system employed by millers.]]\nBasque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin.<ref>Aguirre Sorondo ''Tratado de Molinolog\u00eda \u2013 Los Molinos de Guip\u00fazcoa'' Eusko Ikaskuntza 1988 {{ISBN|84-86240-66-2}}</ref> In this system the symbols are arranged either along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.\n\nThe system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, [[vigesimal]]. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Fractions are relatively common, especially {{1/2}}.\n\nThe exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a '''V''' shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines. This system is no longer in general use but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.\n\n==Examples==\n=== Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===\n{|\n|-\n|| ''Gizon-emakume guztiak aske jaiotzen dira, duintasun eta eskubide berberak dituztela; eta ezaguera eta kontzientzia dutenez gero, elkarren artean senide legez jokatu beharra dute.''\n||\n|| {{IPA-eu|\u0261is\u033bonemakume \u0261us\u033btiak as\u033ake jajots\u033ben di\u027ea {{!}} duintas\u033aun eta es\u033akubide berbe\u027eak ditus\u033btela {{!}} eta es\u033ba\u0261ue\u027ea eta konts\u033bients\u033bia dutenes\u033b \u0261e\u027eo {{!}} elkaren artean s\u033aenide leges\u033b jokatu beara dute}}\n||\n|| All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Ulvaeus studied business and law at [[Lund University]] after doing his [[Swedish Armed Forces|military service]] with comedian Magnus Holmstr\u00f6m.\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Hootenanny Singers.jpg|thumb|left|Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus with [[The Hootenanny Singers]]]]\nBefore gaining international recognition with [[ABBA]], Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-[[schlager]] band [[Hootenanny Singers]], early known as the \"West Bay Singers\", who had an enormous following in [[Scandinavia]]. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the [[Hep Stars]], and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group's keyboard player, [[Benny Andersson]]. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: \"Isn't It Easy To Say\", a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: \"A Flower In My Garden\", recorded by [[Hep Stars]], and their first \"real\" hit \"Ljuva Sextiotal\", for which [[Stig Anderson]] wrote lyrics. The latter, a cabar\u00e9t-style ironic song about the 1960s, was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for the [[Eurovision|Eurovision Song Contest]], but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva [[Brita Borg]]. Another hit came in 1969 with \"Speleman\", also recorded by Hep Stars.\n\nWhile filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Bj\u00f6rn met an eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]]. Benny had himself met his future spouse, a 23-year-old jazz and schlager vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], only weeks before.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at [[Polar Record Company]] (headed by future manager [[Stig Anderson]]), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of \"A Flower in My Garden\" (\"''Fr\u00f6ken Bl\u00e5klint''\") was one of Bj\u00f6rn & Benny's first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song \"She's My Kind of Girl\", which became their first single as a duo.  It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden (and by chance a top-ten hit in Japan two years later).\n\nThe Hootenanny Singers entered [[Svensktoppen]], the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with \"Omkring Tiggarn Fr\u00e5n Luossa\", a cover of an old folk-schlager song.  It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Bj\u00f6rn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano.\n\nAfter ABBA, Ulvaeus and Andersson created the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', a collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/05/1025667057155.html |title=\t\nHappily ABBA after |date=6 July 2002 |first=Peter |last=Paphides |publisher=smh.com.au |accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref> ''[[Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la]]'' (based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]), and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (based on ABBA songs).\n\nTogether with Andersson, Ulvaeus was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] in the category \"Outstanding Music\" (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category \"Best Orchestrations\" (for the musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest in [[Istanbul]], thirty years after ABBA had won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]] in [[Brighton]], UK,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Libby|title=Abba's Eurovision win in Brighton remembered 40 years on|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-26901044|work=BBC|date=5 April 2014}}</ref> Ulvaeus appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video\". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split. In fact, they each filmed their appearances separately.\n\nUlvaeus also shared with Andersson \"The Special International [[Ivor Novello]] Award\" from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]], \"The Music Export Prize\" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),<ref>[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 \"The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to...\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314085034/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |date=14 March 2012 }}.

The couple decided to separate in late 1978, and their divorce was finalised in July 1980. Ulvaeus then married music journalist Lena K\u00e4llersj\u00f6 on 6 January 1981. This marriage produced two daughters: Emma (born in 1982) and Anna (born in 1986).\n\nUlvaeus and K\u00e4llersj\u00f6 currently live in [[Stockholm]]. From 1984 to 1990 they lived in the UK, where Ulvaeus founded an IT business with his brother.\n\nHe is also one of four people (including [[Per Gessle]]) who own NoteHeads, a Swedish company which publishes the [[Scorewriter|music notation program]] [[Igor Engraver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noteheads.com/noteheads/noteheads.html |title=Noteheads.com \u2013 Corporate |accessdate=29 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005121/http://www.noteheads.com/noteheads/noteheads.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nUlvaeus is a member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]'s Swedish member organisation [[Humanisterna]], and was awarded their annual prize, ''Hedenius-priset'', in 2006.

Since 2001, he has been active with his own band [[Benny Anderssons orkester]].\n\n==Early life==\nG\u00f6ran Bror Benny Andersson was born in the [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastan]] district of [[Stockholm]], to civil engineer G\u00f6sta Andersson (1912\u20131973) and his wife Laila (1920\u20131971). His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948. Andersson's musical background comes from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the [[accordion]], and at six, Benny got his own. Father G\u00f6sta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish [[folk music]], [[traditional music]], and the odd [[schlager]]. Benny recalls the first records he bought were \"Du Bist Musik\" by Italian schlager singer [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Elvis Presley]]'s  \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\". He was especially impressed by the flip side \"Treat Me Nice\" as this featured a piano.  This variety of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.\n\nWhen Andersson was ten he got his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Gr\u00f6nvall, with whom he had two children: Peter (born 1963) and Hel\u00e9ne (born 1965). In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined \"Elverkets Spelmanslag\" (\"The Electricity Board Folk Music Group\"), the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire was mainly instrumentals, one of his numbers was \"[[Baby Elephant Walk]]\", and he wrote his first songs.\n\n==Career==\n===Hep Stars (1964\u20131969)===\nIn October 1964 he joined the [[Hep Stars]] as keyboardist and they made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit \"Cadillac\", eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits \"No Response\", \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", \"Consolation\", \"It's Nice To Be Back\" and \"She Will Love You\" amongst others.\n\n===Before ABBA (1969\u20131972)===\nAndersson met [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] in June 1966, and the two started writing songs together, their first being \"Isn't It Easy To Say\", eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote several songs and submitted \"Hej, Clown\" for the 1969 [[Melodifestivalen]] \u2013 the Swedish [[Eurovision Song Festival]] finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest he met vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], and they soon became a couple. Around the same time his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]].\n\nThe personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus' songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Bj\u00f6rn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (a hit with Brita Borg) and \"Speleman\" (a hit for the Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the girls' voices convinced the songwriters to model their 'group' on various [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] acts such as [[Blue Mink]], [[Middle of the Road (band)|Middle of the Road]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Thus, [[ABBA]] came to life.\n\n===ABBA (1972\u20131982)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson at The Eddy Go Round Show 1975.png|thumb|200px|left|Andersson on 'The Eddy Go Round Show' in 1975.]]\n{{Main|ABBA}}\nThe group's breakthrough came with winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Sweden with \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of No. 1 hits.\n\n===After ABBA: ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and ''Mamma Mia!'' (1983\u2013present)===\nAfter ABBA Andersson continued writing music with Ulvaeus. Their first project was the [[stage musical]] ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', written with [[Tim Rice]]. The ''Chess'' concept album \u2013 with vocals by [[Elaine Paige]], [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Murray Head]] and Swedes [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Skifs]] \u2013 was released in October 1984, selling two million copies worldwide. The Paige/Dickson duet \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" became a major UK No. 1 hit, and Murray Head's \"[[One Night in Bangkok]]\" gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US No. 3 hit.\n\n''Chess'' was staged in London's West End [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in May 1986 and received mixed to positive reviews, running for about three years. A revised staging on Broadway in April 1988 received poor reviews, running for two months.\n\nIn 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister [[Anders Glenmark|Anders]] and [[Karin Glenmark]], featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], and a second album with more music by Bj\u00f6rn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit \"[[Mio My Mio (song)|Mio My Mio]]\"; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', for which Andersson co-produced the music.\n\nIn 1987, Andersson released his first solo album ''Klinga Mina Klockor'' (\"Chime, My Bells\"). All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the ''[[Orsa Spelm\u00e4n]]'' (Orsa Folk Musicians) on fiddles. A second solo album followed: ''November 1989''.\n\nIn 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish No. 1 hit with \"Lassie\", sung by female cabaret group [[Ainbusk]], for whom he also wrote the [[Svensktoppen]] hits \"\u00c4lska Mig\" and \"Dr\u00f6mmarnas Golv\". He decided to produce an album with [[Josefin Nilsson]] from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album ''Shapes'', featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.\n\nIn 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.\n\nFrom the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995, ''[[Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la]]'' premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled ''Kristina'', was staged in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for one night in April 2010.\n\nAndersson's next project was ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around 24 of ABBA's songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster, with versions in several languages being played in many countries, including the UK (West End premiere in April 1999), Canada ([[Royal Alexandra Theatre|Toronto]] premiere in 2000), the USA (Broadway premiere in 2001), and Sweden ([[Swedish language]] premiere in 2005).\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video\". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Frida's appearance was filmed separately.\n\nA film version of ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the ABBA songs with musicians from the original ABBA recording sessions. ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia! The Movie]]'' has become the most successful film musical of all time, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.\n\n===Benny Anderssons Orkester (2001\u2013present)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson Orkester.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Benny Anderssons Orkester at a concert in Minnesota in 2006]]\nAndersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (\"Benny Andersson's orchestra\", BAO), with fellow Swedes [[Helen Sj\u00f6holm]] (of ''Kristina from Duvem\u00e5la'') and [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] (of ''Chess''), with lyrics to new material sometimes written by [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]]. BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.\n\nBAO recently achieved a new record in Sweden on the [[Svensktoppen]] chart by staying there for 243 weeks with the song \"''Du \u00e4r min man''\" (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by Sj\u00f6holm.<ref>[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 ''Rekord p\u00e5 Svensktoppen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423084057/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 |date=23 April 2009 }}, [[Sveriges Radio]]. Retrieved 5 April 2009.</ref>\n\n===New compositions (1984\u2013present)===\nAndersson composes primarily for his band BAO, with vocalists Sj\u00f6holm and K\u00f6rberg, but he keeps his older material alive by re-visiting it, as in ''Mamma Mia!'' and the Swedish version of ''Chess''.\n\nFor a compilation album of the Glenmark duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], Andersson had Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two songs from 1984 and 1987.\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote seven songs for Andersson's BAO 2011 album ''O Klang Och Jubeltid'', performed as usual by vocalists Sj\u00f6holm, K\u00f6rberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO, now named \"The Benny Andersson Band\", released their first international record, the album ''The Story of a Heart''. It was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel Hotel Rival, titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled \"''Jag vill bli gammal''\" (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show \"''Your Days Are Numbered''\", which was never recorded and released but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song \"''Innan Gryningen''\" (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] was performed live, but not yet recorded and released. In 2007, they wrote the new song \"''Han som har vunnit allt''\" (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor and singer [[Anders Ekborg]].  Ulvaeus wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Andersson's solo albums ''I Walk with You Mama'' (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989) and ''After the Rain'' (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie Von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak''. Barbara Dickson recorded an Ulvaeus and Andersson song called \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the song eventually was released by Australian ''Mamma Mia!'' musical star Anne Wood's album of ABBA covers, ''Divine Discontent''. As of October 2012, Ulvaeus had mentioned writing new material with Andersson for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO box), and Andersson is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, ''Hj\u00e4lp S\u00f6kes'' (\"''Help is Wanted''\") together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013.\nAndersson has also written music for a documentary film about [[Olof Palme]], re-recording the track \"Sorgmarch\" from his last album as a theme throughout the film.\nThe song \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\", recorded 2004 by Helen Sj\u00f6holm with BAO, has also been performed in concert in English (lyrics by Ylva Eggehorn) by opera [[baritone]] [[Bryn Terfel]].\nOn 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the [[EBU]] and the [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that Andersson, along with Ulvaeus and the Swedish DJ and record producer [[Avicii]], had composed the anthem for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=abbas_benny_bjoern_and_aviccii_to_write_eurovision_anthem|title=ABBA's Benny, Bj\u00f6rn and Avicii to write 'Eurovision anthem'|work=[[EBU]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nA new album of Andersson compositions presented in a choral style was released on September 18, 2015. \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\" was produced in Andersson's Mono Music studio, under the direction of choirmaster Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvist, who died before the album's release. Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvists Choir, conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin, performed two concerts at Skeppsholmen on September 20, featuring Benny Andersson on piano. The album includes songs in Swedish and English from a range of Andersson's projects, such as ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and BAO.\n\n===Film music===\nAndersson has written music to several films for screen and television; the first attempt in the early 1970s for the Swedish erotica movie ''The Seduction of Inga''; the film was not a success, but the 'Bj\u00f6rn & Benny' single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song renamed in Japan as \"The Little Girl of the Cold Wind\").\n\nIn 1987, Andersson wrote music and co-produced the soundtrack with Anders Eljas for the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', based on Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]]s ''[[Mio, My Son]]''. The title song became a huge hit in Sweden for [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]].\n\nIn 2000, he wrote the music for fellow Swede (no relation) [[Roy Andersson]]'s film ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''  (the music later re-recorded, featuring new lyrics, with BAO! with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm). He also wrote the theme for Roy Andersson's next film, ''[[You, the Living]]'', from 2007.\n\nAndersson worked on the film adaptation of ''Mamma Mia!''. He also wrote the film score for the 2012 documentary ''[[Palme (film)|Palme]]'' about Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/filmare-spanar-in-personen-palme |title=Filmare spanar in personen Palme |publisher=DN.SE |date= |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> He later won a [[Guldbagge Award]] for Best Original Score, for that film at the [[48th Guldbagge Awards]].<ref name=\"sydsvenskan\">{{cite web|title=Nomineringarna till Guldbaggen|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/nomineringarna-till-guldbaggen/|publisher=Sydsvenskan.se|language=Swedish|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nTogether with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] in a category \"Outstanding Music\" (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category \"Best Orchestrations\" (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. Andersson/Ulvaeus also won a [[Touring Broadway Awards|Touring Broadway Award]] for the musical \"Mamma Mia\" (best score).\n\nDuring his post-ABBA career Andersson won four Swedish [[Grammis]] awards, and together with Ulvaeus received the \"Special International\" [[Ivor Novello]] award from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', twice \"The Music Export Prize\" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |title=The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to |publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314085034/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> as well as the \"Lifetime Achievement\" award from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF). In 2002, Andersson was given an honorary professorship by the Swedish Government for his \"ability to create high-class music reaching people around the world\".\n\nIn 2007, he was elected a member of [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]], and in 2008 received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Stockholm University]] Faculty of Humanities for contributing importantly both to the preservation and the growth of the Swedish folk music tradition.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Andersson appeared on stage in New York with former wife Anni-Frid Lyngstad to accept ABBA's award of induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. \"If you live in a country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists,\" he said. \"It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, you can hear it in the Russian folk songs, you can hear in the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, you can see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and you can hear it in the voice of Jussi Bj\u00f6rling. And you can hear in the sound of Frida and Agnetha on some of our songs too.\"\n\nIn 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the [[Lule\u00e5 Tekniska Universitet]] Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ltu.se/research/akh/Hedersdoktorer/Benny-Andersson-Filosofie-hedersdoktor-2012-1.96016?l=en |title=Benny Andersson, Honorary Doctor of Philosophy 2012 \u2013 LTU \u2013 Lule\u00e5 University of Technology |publisher=Ltu.se |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAndersson won the Swedish \"Guldbaggen\" award in 2012 as composer of the music for the film \"Palme\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://guldbaggen.se/nominering/benny-andersson |title=B\u00e4sta Musik 2012 Vinnare |publisher=guldbaggen.se |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|300px|Andersson with Lyngstad in 1976]]\nAndersson was engaged to Christina Gr\u00f6nvall. In 1963, they had a son, Peter Gr\u00f6nvall, and in 1965, a daughter, Hel\u00e9ne. They split in 1966 and Christina kept custody of the children as Andersson was then at the peak of his Hep Stars' success.

Page 2535.</ref>\n\nOriginally, [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available. Since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, \u03c0/4-[[DQPSK]] (differential quadrature phase-shift keying) and 8-DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices. Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous [[bit rate]] of 1{{nbsp}}[[data rate units|Mbit/s]] is possible. The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe \u03c0/4-DPSK and 8-DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3{{nbsp}}Mbit/s respectively. The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a ''BR/EDR radio''.\n\nBluetooth is a [[packet switching|packet-based protocol]] with a [[master/slave (technology)|master/slave architecture]]. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a [[piconet]]. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5s intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625{{nbsp}}[[\u00b5s]], and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250{{nbsp}}\u00b5s. In the simple case of single-slot packets, the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.\n\nThe above excludes Bluetooth Low Energy, introduced in the 4.0 specification, which [[Bluetooth Low Energy#Radio interface|uses the same spectrum but somewhat differently]].\n\n=== Communication and connection ===\nA master BR/EDR Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum. <!-- This sentence contains redundant text, repeated from the previous paragraph. --> The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master\u2014as an initiator of the connection\u2014but may subsequently operate as the slave).\n\nThe Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a [[scatternet]], in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.\n\nAt any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is (in theory) supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is possible. The specification is vague as to required behavior in scatternets.<ref>{{Cite journal |last3=Patil |last2=Koul |last=Kurawar |first3=Viki Tukaram |first2=Ayushi |first=Arwa |date=August 2014 |title=Survey of Bluetooth and Applications |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology |volume=3 |pages=2832\u20132837 |issn=2278-1323}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Ranges of Bluetooth devices by class\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! colspan=2 | {{abbr|Max.|Maximum}} permitted power\n! rowspan=2 | {{abbr|Typ.|Typical}} range<ref name=\"bluetooth1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Basics.aspx |title=Basics &#124; Bluetooth Technology Website |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date=23 May 2010 }}</ref> <br />(m)\n|-\n!

Most Bluetooth applications are for indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and signal fading due to signal reflections make the range far lower than specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products.\n\nMost Bluetooth applications are battery-powered Class&nbsp;2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class&nbsp;1 or Class&nbsp;2 device as the lower-powered device tends to set the range limit.

Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high-speed cabling for general [[local area network]] access in work areas or home. This category of applications is sometimes called [[wireless local area network]]s (WLAN). Bluetooth was intended for portable equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless [[personal area network]] (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting, and also works for fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).\n\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth serves well in simple applications where two devices need to connect with a minimal configuration like a button press, as in headsets and remote controls, while Wi-Fi suits better in applications where some degree of client configuration is possible and high speeds are required, especially for network access through an access node. However, Bluetooth access points do exist, and ad-hoc connections are possible with Wi-Fi though not as simple as with Bluetooth. [[Wi-Fi Direct]] was recently developed to add a more Bluetooth-like ad-hoc functionality to Wi-Fi.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Devices===\n[[File:Drone 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle with a 100&nbsp;m range.]]\nBluetooth exists in numerous products such as telephones, [[Wireless speaker|speakers]], tablets, media players, robotics systems, laptops, and console gaming equipment as well as some high definition [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], [[modem]]s, [[hearing aid]]s<ref name=\"Bluetooth Hearing Aids\">{{Cite web |title=Bluetooth hearing aids: Hearing aids with Bluetooth technology use today\u2019s wireless technology to help you easily stay connected to iOS and Android phones, televisions, tablets and other favorite audio devices. |last=Mroz |first=Mandy |date=2018-05-21 |website=Healthy Hearing |access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref> and even watches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/Pages/Watch.aspx |title=Watch |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918122452/http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/pages/watch.aspx |archive-date=18 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Given the variety of devices which use the Bluetooth, coupled with the contemporary deprecation of headphone [[Phone connector (audio)|jack]]s by Apple, Google, and other companies, and the lack of regulation by the FCC, the technology is prone to interference. <ref name=\"Why does Bluetooth still suck?\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-bluetooth-sucks-bad-problems-issues-disconnects-2018-2 |title=Why does Bluetooth still suck? |last=Eizikowitz |first=Grant |date=2018-03-05 |website=Business Insider |access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref>  Nonetheless Bluetooth is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations.

Bluetooth v3.0 + HS provides theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] link.\n\nThe main new feature is AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY), the addition of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] as a high-speed transport. The high-speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices that display the \"+HS\" logo actually support Bluetooth over 802.11 high-speed data transfer. A Bluetooth v3.0 device without the \"+HS\" suffix is only required to support features introduced in Core Specification Version 3.0<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=40560|title=Bluetooth Core Version 3.0 + HS specification}}</ref> or earlier Core Specification Addendum 1.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=174214|title=Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum (CSA) 1}}</ref>\n\n; [[#L2CAP|L2CAP]] Enhanced modes: Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM) implements reliable L2CAP channel, while Streaming Mode (SM) implements unreliable channel with no retransmission or flow control. Introduced in Core Specification Addendum 1.\n; Alternative MAC/PHY: Enables the use of alternative [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]]s for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration. However, when large quantities of data must be sent, the high-speed alternative MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with Wi-Fi) transports the data. This means that Bluetooth uses proven low power connection models when the system is idle, and the faster radio when it must send large quantities of data. AMP links require enhanced L2CAP modes.\n; Unicast Connectionless Data: Permits sending service data without establishing an explicit L2CAP channel. It is intended for use by applications that require low latency between user action and reconnection/transmission of data. This is only appropriate for small amounts of data.\n; Enhanced Power Control: Updates the power control feature to remove the open loop power control, and also to clarify ambiguities in power control introduced by the new modulation schemes added for EDR. Enhanced power control removes the ambiguities by specifying the behaviour that is expected. The feature also adds closed loop power control, meaning RSSI filtering can start as the response is received. Additionally, a \"go straight to maximum power\" request has been introduced. This is expected to deal with the headset link loss issue typically observed when a user puts their phone into a pocket on the opposite side to the headset.\n\n==== Ultra-wideband ====\nThe high-speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 was originally intended for [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding, and ultimately UWB was omitted from the Core v3.0 specification.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39643174,00.htm\n|title= Bluetooth 3.0 released without ultrawideband\n|author=David Meyer\n|date=22 April 2009\n|publisher=zdnet.co.uk\n|accessdate=22 April 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2009, the [[WiMedia Alliance]] announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB) specifications.

The L2CAP protocol is responsible for the segmentation and reassembly of the packets\n\n==== Hardware ====\nThe hardware that makes up the Bluetooth device is made up of, logically, two parts; which may or may not be physically separate. A radio device, responsible for modulating and transmitting the signal; and a digital controller. The digital controller is likely a CPU, one of whose functions is to run a Link Controller; and interfaces with the host device; but some functions may be delegated to hardware. The Link Controller is responsible for the processing of the baseband and the management of ARQ and physical layer FEC protocols. In addition, it handles the transfer functions (both asynchronous and synchronous), audio coding and data encryption. The CPU of the device is responsible for attending the instructions related to Bluetooth of the host device, in order to simplify its operation. To do this, the CPU runs software called Link Manager that has the function of communicating with other devices through the LMP protocol.\n\n=== Bluetooth protocol stack ===\n{{Main|Bluetooth protocols}}\n[[File:Bluetooth protokoly.svg|thumb|250px|right|Bluetooth Protocol Stack]]\n\nBluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Stallings, William. (2005). ''Wireless communications & networks.'=' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.''</ref> Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are LMP, L2CAP and SDP. In addition, devices that communicate with Bluetooth almost universally can use these protocols: [[Bluetooth protocols#Host/controller interface (HCI)|HCI]] and RFCOMM.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==== Link Manager ====\nThe Link Manager is the system that manages to establish the connection between devices. It is responsible for the establishment, authentication and configuration of the link. The Link Manager locates other managers and communicates with them thanks to the management protocol of the LMP link. In order to perform its function as a service provider, the LM uses the services included in the link controller (LC, \"Link Controller\").\nThe Link Manager Protocol basically consists of a number of PDUs (Protocol Data Units) that are sent from one device to another. The following is a list of supported services:\n* Transmission and reception of data.\n* Name request\n* Request of the link addresses.\n* Establishment of the connection.\n* Authentication.\n* Negotiation of link mode and connection establishment.\n\n==== Host Controller Interface ====\nThe Host Controller Interface provides a command interface for the controller and for the link manager, which allows access to the hardware status and control registers.\nThis interface provides an access layer for all Bluetooth devices. The HCI layer of the machine exchanges commands and data with the HCI firmware present in the Bluetooth device. One of the most important HCI tasks that must be performed is the automatic discovery of other Bluetooth devices that are within the coverage radius.\n\n==== Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol ====\nThe ''Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol'' (L2CAP) is used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.\nProvides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.\n\nIn ''Basic'' mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64&nbsp;kB, with 672 bytes as the default [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.\n\nIn ''Retransmission and Flow Control'' modes, L2CAP can be configured either for isochronous data or reliable data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.\n\nBluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification. These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:\n; Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM): This mode is an improved version of the original retransmission mode. This mode provides a reliable L2CAP channel.\n; Streaming Mode (SM): This is a very simple mode, with no retransmission or flow control. This mode provides an unreliable L2CAP channel.\n\nReliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio flushes packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.\n\nOnly L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.\n\n==== Service Discovery Protocol ====\nThe ''Service Discovery Protocol'' (SDP) allows a device to discover services offered by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when you use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth headset, the phone uses SDP to determine which [[Bluetooth profile]]s the headset can use (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)]] etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed for the phone to connect to the headset using each of them. Each service is identified by a [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128).\n\n==== Radio Frequency Communications ====\n''Radio Frequency Communications'' (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used for generating a virtual serial data stream. RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates [[EIA-232]] (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer, i.e. it is a serial port emulation.\n\nRFCOMM provides a simple reliable data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.\n\nMany Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.\n\n==== Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol ====\nThe ''Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol'' (BNEP) is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.\nIts main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.\nBNEP performs a similar function to [[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]] in Wireless LAN.\n\n==== Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol ====\nThe ''Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol'' (AVCTP) is used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.\n\n==== Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol ====\nThe ''Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol'' (AVDTP) is used by the advanced audio distribution profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an L2CAP channel intended for video distribution profile in the Bluetooth transmission.\n\n==== Telephony Control Protocol ====\nThe ''Telephony Control Protocol{{nbsp}}\u2013 Binary'' (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices. Additionally, \"TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices.\"\n\nTCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.\n\n==== Adopted protocols ====\nAdopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth's protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to code protocols only when necessary. The adopted protocols include:\n;[[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP): Internet standard protocol for transporting [[IP datagram]]s over a point-to-point link.\n;[[TCP/IP]]/UDP: Foundation Protocols for TCP/IP protocol suite\n;[[OBject EXchange|Object Exchange Protocol]] (OBEX): Session-layer protocol for the exchange of objects, providing a model for object and operation representation\n;[[Wireless Application Protocol|Wireless Application Environment/Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAE/WAP): WAE specifies an application framework for wireless devices and WAP is an open standard to provide mobile users access to telephony and information services.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n=== Baseband error correction ===\nDepending on packet type, individual packets may be protected by [[error correction]], either 1/3 rate [[forward error correction]] (FEC) or 2/3 rate. In addition, packets with CRC will be retransmitted until acknowledged by [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ).\n\n=== Setting up connections ===\nAny Bluetooth device in ''discoverable mode'' transmits the following information on demand:\n* Device name\n* Device class\n* List of services\n* Technical information (for example: device features, manufacturer, Bluetooth specification used, clock offset)\n\nAny device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.\n\nEvery device has a [[MAC address|unique 48-bit address]]. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.\n\nMost cellular phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most cellular phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several cellular phones in range named [[Sony Ericsson T610|T610]] (see [[Bluejacking]]).\n\n{{anchor|Pairing}}\n\n=== Pairing and bonding ===\n\n==== Motivation ====\nMany services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or let a connecting party control the Bluetooth device. Security reasons make it necessary to recognize specific devices, and thus enable control over which devices can connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to be able to establish a connection without user intervention (for example, as soon as in range).\n\nTo resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called ''bonding'', and a bond is generated through a process called ''pairing''. The pairing process is triggered either by a specific request from a user to generate a bond (for example, the user explicitly requests to \"Add a Bluetooth device\"), or it is triggered automatically when connecting to a service where (for the first time) the identity of a device is required for security purposes. These two cases are referred to as dedicated bonding and general bonding respectively.\n\nPairing often involves some level of user interaction. This user interaction confirms the identity of the devices. When pairing successfully completes, a bond forms between the two devices, enabling those two devices to connect to each other in the future without repeating the pairing process to confirm device identities. When desired, the user can remove the bonding relationship.\n\n==== Implementation ====\nDuring pairing, the two devices establish a relationship by creating a [[shared secret]] known as a ''link key''. If both devices store the same link key, they are said to be ''paired'' or ''bonded''. A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can [[cryptography|cryptographically]] [[authentication|authenticate]] the identity of the other device, ensuring it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key is generated, an authenticated [[Asynchronous Connection-Less]] (ACL) link between the devices may be [[encryption|encrypted]] to protect exchanged data against [[eavesdropping]]. Users can delete link keys from either device, which removes the bond between the devices\u2014so it is possible for one device to have a stored link key for a device it is no longer paired with.\n\nBluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication and as such require pairing before they let a remote device connect. Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.\n\n==== Pairing mechanisms ====\nPairing mechanisms changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:\n* ''Legacy pairing'': This is the only method available in Bluetooth v2.0 and before. Each device must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN code]]; pairing is only successful if both devices enter the same PIN code. Any 16-byte UTF-8 string may be used as a PIN code; however, not all devices may be capable of entering all possible PIN codes.\n** ''Limited input devices'': The obvious example of this class of device is a Bluetooth Hands-free headset, which generally have few inputs. These devices usually have a ''fixed PIN'', for example \"0000\" or \"1234\", that are hard-coded into the device.\n** ''Numeric input devices'': Mobile phones are classic examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter a numeric value up to 16 digits in length.\n** ''Alpha-numeric input devices'': PCs and smartphones are examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter full UTF-8 text as a PIN code. If pairing with a less capable device the user must be aware of the input limitations on the other device; there is no mechanism available for a capable device to determine how it should limit the available input a user may use.\n* ''Secure Simple Pairing'' (SSP): This is required by Bluetooth v2.1, although a Bluetooth v2.1 device may only use legacy pairing to interoperate with a v2.0 or earlier device. Secure Simple Pairing uses a form of [[public key cryptography]], and some types can help protect against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]], or MITM attacks. SSP has the following authentication mechanisms:\n** ''Just works'': As the name implies, this method just works, with no user interaction. However, a device may prompt the user to confirm the pairing process. This method is typically used by headsets with very limited IO capabilities, and is more secure than the fixed PIN mechanism this limited set of devices uses for legacy pairing. This method provides no man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection.\n** ''Numeric comparison'': If both devices have a display, and at least one can accept a binary yes/no user input, they may use Numeric Comparison. This method displays a 6-digit numeric code on each device. The user should compare the numbers to ensure they are identical. If the comparison succeeds, the user(s) should confirm pairing on the device(s) that can accept an input. This method provides MITM protection, assuming the user confirms on both devices and actually performs the comparison properly.\n** ''Passkey Entry'': This method may be used between a device with a display and a device with numeric keypad entry (such as a keyboard), or two devices with numeric keypad entry. In the first case, the display presents a 6-digit numeric code to the user, who then enters the code on the keypad. In the second case, the user of each device enters the same 6-digit number. Both of these cases provide MITM protection.\n** ''Out of band'' (OOB): This method uses an external means of communication, such as [[near-field communication]] (NFC) to exchange some information used in the pairing process. Pairing is completed using the Bluetooth radio, but requires information from the OOB mechanism. This provides only the level of MITM protection that is present in the OOB mechanism.\n\nSSP is considered simple for the following reasons:\n* In most cases, it does not require a user to generate a passkey.\n* For use cases not requiring MITM protection, user interaction can be eliminated.\n* For ''numeric comparison'', MITM protection can be achieved with a simple equality comparison by the user.\n* Using OOB with NFC enables pairing when devices simply get close, rather than requiring a lengthy discovery process.\n\n==== Security concerns ====\nPrior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple [[Stream cipher attack|XOR attacks]] to retrieve the encryption key.\n* Turning off encryption is required for several normal operations, so it is problematic to detect if encryption is disabled for a valid reason or for a security attack.\nBluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:\n* Encryption is required for all non-SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) connections\n* A new Encryption Pause and Resume feature is used for all normal operations that require that encryption be disabled. This enables easy identification of normal operation from security attacks.\n* The encryption key must be refreshed before it expires.\nLink keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers let link keys be stored on the device\u2014however, if the device is removable, this means that the link key moves with the device.\n\n== Security ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n{{see also|Mobile security#Attacks based on communication networks}}\n\nBluetooth implements [[confidentiality]], [[authentication]] and [[key (cryptography)|key]] derivation with custom algorithms based on the [[SAFER|SAFER+]] [[block cipher]]. Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface). During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Juha T. Vainio\n|date=25 May 2000\n|title=Bluetooth Security\n|publisher=Helsinki University of Technology\n|url=http://www.iki.fi/jiitv/bluesec.pdf\n|accessdate=1 January 2009\n}}</ref>\nThe [[E0 (cipher)|E0]] stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality, and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key. Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN, which has been entered into one or both devices.\n\nAn overview of Bluetooth vulnerabilities exploits was published in 2007 by Andreas Becker.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author=Andreas Becker\n|date=16 August 2007\n|title=Bluetooth Security & Hacks\n|publisher=Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum\n|url=http://gsyc.es/~anto/ubicuos2/bluetooth_security_and_hacks.pdf\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=10 October 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2008, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published a Guide to Bluetooth Security as a reference for organizations. It describes Bluetooth security capabilities and how to secure Bluetooth technologies effectively. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation. Users and organizations must evaluate their acceptable level of risk and incorporate security into the lifecycle of Bluetooth devices. To help mitigate risks, included in the NIST document are security checklists with guidelines and recommendations for creating and maintaining secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Scarfone, K. |author2=Padgette, J.\n |lastauthoramp=yes |date=September 2008\n|title=Guide to Bluetooth Security\n|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology\n|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-121-rev1/sp800-121_rev1.pdf\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=3 July 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nBluetooth v2.1&nbsp;\u2013 finalized in 2007 with consumer devices first appearing in 2009&nbsp;\u2013 makes significant changes to Bluetooth's security, including pairing.

Common applications include short messages, e.g., \"You've just been bluejacked!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/bluejacking.htm|title=What is bluejacking?|author=John Fuller|publisher=howstuffworks|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> Bluejacking does not involve the removal or alteration of any data from the device.<ref>Kaviarasu, S., & Muthupandian, P.

Security advances have alleviated this issue.\n\n=== History of security concerns ===\n\n==== 2001\u20132004 ====\nIn 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from [[Bell Laboratories]] discovered flaws in the Bluetooth pairing protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Security Weaknesses in Bluetooth\n|publisher= RSA Security Conf.&nbsp;\u2013 Cryptographer\u2019s Track\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.23.7357\n}}</ref> In 2003, Ben and Adam Laurie from A.L.

The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as \"29A\" and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or [[Symbian OS]] since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also [[Bluetooth sniping]]) showed that the range of Class&nbsp;2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to {{convert|1.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Long Distance Snarf\n|publisher=Trifinite.org\n|url=http://trifinite.org/trifinite_stuff_lds.html\n|accessdate=1 February 2007\n}}</ref>\nThis poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on, although these can be deduced within a few minutes if the device is in use.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Dispelling Common Bluetooth Misconceptions\n|publisher=SANS\n|url=http://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/bluetooth\n|accessdate=9 July 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==== 2005 ====\nIn January 2005, a mobile [[malware]] worm known as Lasco surfaced. The worm began targeting mobile phones using [[Symbian OS]] ([[S60 (software platform)|Series 60 platform]]) using Bluetooth enabled devices to replicate itself and spread to other devices. The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (Velasco.sis) from another device. Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect. Additionally, the worm infects other [[.SIS]]&nbsp;files on the device, allowing replication to another device through the use of removable media ([[Secure Digital]], [[Compact Flash]], etc.).

The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Yaniv Shaked |author2=Avishai Wool |date=2 May 2005\n|title=Cracking the Bluetooth PIN\n|publisher=School of Electrical Engineering Systems, Tel Aviv University\n|url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yash/shaked-wool-mobisys05/\n|accessdate=1 February 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2005, police in [[Cambridgeshire]], England, issued warnings about thieves using Bluetooth enabled phones to track other devices left in cars.

The SIG is a not-for-profit, non-stock corporation founded in September 1998.  The SIG is headquartered in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The SIG has local offices in Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, and Malm\u00f6.\n\nThe SIG does not make, manufacture or sell Bluetooth enabled products.\n\n==Introduction==\n''Bluetooth'' technology provides a way to exchange information between [[wireless]] devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[digital camera]]s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range [[radio]] [[frequency]] band. Originally developed by [[Ericsson]], ''Bluetooth'' technology is now used in many different products by many different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]]. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, but published ''Bluetooth'' specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website [http://www.bluetooth.com/ENGLISH/TECHNOLOGY/Pages/default.aspx].\n\nThe SIG owns the ''Bluetooth'' word mark, figure mark and combination mark.  These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into their products.  To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.  The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, protect the ''Bluetooth'' trademarks and evangelize ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology. In 2016, the SIG introduced a new visual and creative identity to support Bluetooth technology as the catalyst for the Internet of Things (IoT). This change included an updated logo, a new tagline and deprecation of the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos [https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines].\n\nAt its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's managing director, and from 2002 to 2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its executive director. In 2004 he was replaced by [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike). In mid-2012, Mark Powell took the reins as the SIG's current executive director. Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, [[engineering]] and [[marketing]] specialists. From 2002 to 2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], US, and is now based in [[Kirkland, Washington]]. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 30,000 member companies [https://www.bluetooth.com] who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.\n\n==Structure==\nThe [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] members participate in study groups, expert groups, working groups along with committees [https://www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/working-groups/working-groups-committees].\n\n===Study groups===\nThe study groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become working groups in their own right.\n\n===Expert groups===\nThe expert groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of ''Bluetooth'' development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the working groups as well as the corporate groups. \nParticipation in the Expert Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].\n\n===Working groups===\nThe working groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications.  They are responsible for the vast majority of published standards and specifications.  Participation in the working groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].\n\n===Committees===\nThe committees of the SIG deal with the other aspects of licensing, marketing and review including developing and maintaining the Qualification Process, oversight of the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, and developing, improving and maintaining the test  methodology and concepts as well as other strategic functions.\n\n==Membership==\nAny company incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into products, using the technology to offer goods and services or simply re-branding a product with ''Bluetooth'' technology must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. There are three levels of corporate membership totaling more than 20,000 members, and individuals from member companies may also participate.\n\n===Promoter members===\nThese members are the most active in the SIG and have considerable influence over both the strategic and technological directions of Bluetooth as a whole. The current promoter members are:<ref>https://www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/member-directory/?fq=membertype_string-OR|Promoter</ref>\n \n*[[Ericsson|Ericsson Technology Licensing]] (founder member)\n*[[Intel]] (founder member)\n*[[Lenovo]]  (since 2005)\n*[[Microsoft]] (since 1999)\n*[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] (since 2015)\n*[[Nokia]] (founder member)\n*[[Toshiba]] (founder member)\n*[[IBM]] (founder member)\n\nEach Promoter member has one seat (and one vote) on the Board of Directors and the Qualification Review Board (the body responsible for developing and maintaining the qualification process). They each may have multiple staff in the various working groups and committees that comprise the work of the SIG.\n\nThe SIG's website carries a [https://www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/member-directory] full list of  members].\n\n===Associate members===\nThe Bluetooth SIG Associate membership fees have stayed the same since 2006.  Associate membership is renewed annually and the yearly fee depends on the individual company's revenue. Companies with annual revenue in excess of $100M US are considered Large Associates and pay annual membership fees of $35,000 US.  Small Associates are categorized as those organizations with revenue less than $100M US and join the SIG with an annual membership fee of $7,500 US.  Associate members of the SIG get early access to draft specifications at versions 0.5 and 0.7 and are eligible to participate and gain a voting seat in working groups and committees\u2014a key opportunity to work with other Associate and Promoter members on enhancing existing specifications. They are also eligible for enhanced marketing support, receive discounts on product qualification listings and SIG events including Bluetooth World and UnPlugFest (UPF) testing events.\n\n===Adopter members===\nAdopter membership in the SIG is free and entitles members to use published ''Bluetooth '' wireless specifications and ''Bluetooth'' trademarks.  Adopter members do not have early access to unpublished specifications and may not participate in working groups or committees to influence the development of the technology.\n\n===Individuals===\nMembership is not currently open to individuals.\n\n===Universities===\nUniversities are accepted for membership.  The person registering the institution must have the power and authority to accept the Membership Agreements [https://www.bluetooth.com/~/media/files/membership/membership_application.ashx?la=en] on behalf of the school.  Note that students may not register their school, but may create user accounts on the SIG membership portal, [https://www.bluetooth.com www.bluetooth.com], that are associated with their school's existing SIG membership.\n\n==Qualification==\nNext to the development of the technology itself, the qualification process is one of the most important aspects of ''Bluetooth'' technology, supporting interoperability, conformance to the Bluetooth specifications, and to strengthening the Bluetooth brand.\n\nMembers of the Bluetooth SIG must complete the qualification and declaration process for their Bluetooth enabled product(s) to demonstrate and declare compliance to the [https://www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/why-how-to-become-a-member/membership-agreements Membership Agreements].<ref>https://www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/why-how-to-become-a-member/membership-agreements</ref>\n\nThe primary objective of the qualification process is for members to demonstrate their product(s) compliance to the adopted specifications through testing and documentation. After qualification is completed, members need to complete the declaration process. Members declare their compliance to both the Bluetooth Patent/Copyright License Agreement and Bluetooth Trademark License Agreement (\u201cBTLA\u201d).\n\nAn overview of both processes including steps of the processes, types and fees is available on the [https://www.bluetooth.com/develop-with-bluetooth/qualification-listing Bluetooth SIG public portal].\n\nBluetooth Qualification Experts (BQEs)<ref>https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/qualification/bqe.aspx</ref> and Bluetooth Qualification Test Facilities (BQTFs)<ref>https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/qualification/bqtf.aspx</ref> are available to support members through the processes.

Originally based in [[West Germany]], the four original members of the group's official line-up were [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]] from [[Jamaica]], [[Maizie Williams]] from [[Montserrat]] and [[Bobby Farrell]], a Dutch performer with [[Aruba]]n ancestry. The group was formed in 1976 and achieved popularity during the [[disco]] era of the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, various line-ups of the band have performed with different personnel.\n\nThe band has sold more than 150 million records and is known for huge international hits such as \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\", \"[[Ma Baker]]\", \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)#Boney M. version|Sunny]]\", \"[[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]\", \"[[Mary's Boy Child \u2013 Oh My Lord]]\" and, most famously, \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\".\n\n== 1970s ==\n \nGerman singer-songwriter [[Frank Farian]] (real name Franz Reuther)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/starproduzent-frank-farian-deutschland-sucht-den-superstar-und-findet-ihn-nicht-a-726090.html|title=Starproduzent Frank Farian: \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar - und findet ihn nicht\" - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Kultur|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> recorded the dance track \"[[Baby Do You Wanna Bump]]\" in December 1974. Farian sang the repeated line \"Do you do you wanna bump?\" in a deep voice (entirely studio created) as well as performing the high [[falsetto]] chorus. When the record was released as a single, it was credited to \"Boney M.\", a pseudonym Farian had created for himself after watching the Australian detective show ''[[Boney (TV series)|Boney]]''.<ref name=\"Boney\">Boney M by John Shearlaw and David Brown, Hamlin Paperbacks, 1979 {{ISBN|0 600 20009 4}}-page 35-6</ref> He said:\n\n{{bquote|I turned on the TV one day and it was the end of a detective series.

Simple.<ref name=\"Boney\"/>}}\n\nAfter a slow start, the song became a hit in the Netherlands and Belgium. It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to 'front' the group for TV performances. Farian found [[Maizie Williams]] (originally from [[Montserrat]]), who brought in [[Bobby Farrell]], a male exotic dancer from [[Aruba]]. Singer [[Marcia Barrett]] (from Jamaica) joined the group, who brought in [[Liz Mitchell]], former member of the [[Les Humphries Singers]] and Boney M was finalised.\n\n=== ''Take the Heat off Me'' ===\n\nBoney M.'s first album, ''[[Take the Heat off Me]]'', was released in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and \"Lovin' or Leavin'\", both of which were previously recorded in German by another Farian act, [[Gilla (singer)|Gilla]]. As Maizie Williams' voice was not considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing \"[[No Woman No Cry]]\" did not work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound.\n\nThe album's commercial performance was initially lukewarm. However, the group rigorously toured discos, clubs and even country fairs to earn a reputation for themselves. The group's big break came when, at the end of summer 1976, German television producer Michael 'Mike' Leckebusch (of [[Radio Bremen]]) requested the group for his show ''[[Musikladen]]''. Boney M. appeared on the live music show on 18 September 1976, after 10&nbsp;pm and in their daring stage costumes, where they performed the song \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\". The song quickly went to no.1 in Germany, with the album following the success of the single. Another single, \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\" (a cover of the 1966 [[Bobby Hebb]] song) gave the group their second no.1 hit. The group's popularity had also grown throughout Europe, with \"Daddy Cool\" reaching no.1 in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria. Both singles were also Top 10 hits in the UK, which would become one of their biggest markets.\n\n=== ''Love for Sale'' ===\n\nIn 1977, Boney M. released their second album, ''[[Love for Sale (Boney M. album)|Love for Sale]]'', which contained the hits \"[[Ma Baker]]\" and \"[[Belfast (Boney M. song)|Belfast]]\". The group embarked on their first major concert tours with a live band of musicians called 'The Black Beauty Circus' (given their name after Maizie Williams' first band, 'Black Beautiful People'). ''[[Love for Sale (Boney M. album)|Love for Sale]]'' was certified Gold a year after its release in the UK.<ref name=\"BPI certifications\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards Search |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015932/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Both singles from the album reached no.1 in Germany and the UK Top 10.\n\n=== ''Nightflight to Venus'' ===\n\n1978 was the group's biggest year. They released a new double A-sided single, \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]/[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\", which became a massive hit all over Europe, reaching No. 1 in several countries as well as becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time in the UK. It also became their most successful single in the United States, peaking at No. 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop singles chart]]. Following this came their biggest-selling album, ''[[Nightflight to Venus]]'', which spawned further hit singles with \"[[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]\" and \"[[Painter Man]]\". Continuing with their success, they released \"[[Mary's Boy Child &ndash; Oh My Lord]]\", which was the 1978 [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one single]] in the United Kingdom and became another of the biggest selling singles of all time there. Also during 1978, Boney M. made a much publicized promotional visit to the [[Soviet Union]], one of the very few Western acts along with [[Elton John]] to do so, although tracks like \"Rasputin\" were not released in the Soviet Union due to their lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Boney-M-Nightflight-To-Venus/release/442427 |title=\u0411\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u041c* \u2013 \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u041d\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0443 (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWhile it had never been a secret that Bobby Farrell never sang on the group's records (Farian did the male vocals in the studio), in 1978 it became public knowledge that Maizie Williams did not sing on the studio recordings either since \"her voice wasn't suited for this kind of music\", as Farian stated in an interview with German teen magazine ''[[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]''. Since this had become common practice within the disco genre of the late '70s, few people cared \u2013 unlike when Farian did the same thing with [[Milli Vanilli]] in the late 1980s. While only two of Boney M.'s official members actually contributed to the band's records, all four members of the group, including Williams and Farrell, performed the vocals live at Boney M. concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiclange.dk/ |title=Fantastic Boney M |publisher=Musiclange.dk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref> The band's live sound was also augmented by several backing vocalists, which served to mitigate any vocal deficiencies the group may have had compared with the studio productions.\n\n=== ''Oceans of Fantasy'' ===\n\n1979 saw Boney M. release a brand new single, \"[[Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday]]\", which became another Top 10 hit across Europe. Later in the year they released their fourth album, ''[[Oceans of Fantasy]]'', containing two hit singles \u2013 [[El Lute / Gotta Go Home|\"Gotta Go Home\"/\"El Lute\"]] and [[I'm Born Again / Bahama Mama|\"I'm Born Again\"/\"Bahama Mama\"]]. The album also included a \"Lead\" and \"Backing Vocals\" credit for the first time. ''Oceans of Fantasy'' reached no.1 in the UK and was certified Platinum, though their run of Top 10 singles had now ended with \"Gotta Go Home\" peaking at no.12 and \"I'm Born Again\" peaking at 35.\n\n== 1980s ==\nIn 1980, Boney M. released a greatest hits album, ''[[The Magic of Boney M. &ndash; 20 Golden Hits]]'', which also contained two new songs, \"My Friend Jack\" and \"I See a Boat on the River\". It made the No. 1 spot in the UK, reaching Gold status within six weeks of release, though it was their last big-selling album in the UK.\n\n=== ''Boonoonoonoos'' ===\nBoney M.'s fifth album had been scheduled for release in November 1980 but the recording sessions dragged on all through 1981. When ''[[Boonoonoonoos]]'' was finally released by the end of that year, Bobby Farrell was fired from the group due to his unreliability. While still a healthy seller in continental Europe, ''Boonoonoonoos'' failed to crack the UK Top 100 after three consecutive No. 1 albums, and Farrell's departure left the group unable to promote it. Following this, the group released a ''Christmas Album''.\n\n=== ''Ten Thousand Lightyears'' ===\n[[Reggie Tsiboe]] was hired to replace Farrell as the new male member of Boney M. in 1982 but the singles \"The Carnival Is Over\" and \"Jambo\" fared poorly, and the group's seventh album ''[[Ten Thousand Lightyears]]'', issued in 1984, marked another commercial low point peaking at #23 in the German album charts. The group, however, returned to the German Top 20 in the autumn of 1984 with \"Kalimba de Luna\" (a Top 10 hit in France) and \"[[Happy Song]]\" (a cover of a song by Italian [[Italo-disco]] band [[Baby's Gang]]), the latter seeing Bobby Farrell return to the group. Both songs were carbon-copies of the original Italian hits by [[Tony Esposito (musician)|Tony Esposito]] and [[Baby's Gang]] respectively.\n\n=== ''Eye Dance'' ===\nBy 1985, Farian clearly began losing interest in the group, and their final and eighth studio album ''[[Eye Dance]]'' was widely regarded as uninspired and disappointing. After celebrating Boney M.'s 10th anniversary in early 1986, the group officially disbanded after the release of the commercially unsuccessful single 'Young, Free and Single' (still: #49 in the German charts).\n\n== Later years ==\nFrom this point, different versions of the group were formed by members, some with cooperation of Farian, others without (for example by independently obtaining the rights to use the Boney M. name in a different country). One version began touring in the first half of 1987 with Marilyn Scharbaai (Carrilho) taking Liz Mitchell's place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchell's first solo album ''No One Will Force You''. Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 1987\u201388, adding singer Celena Duncan and Ron Gale as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran later replaced Ron Gale.\n\nIn October 1988, the classic Boney M. line-up reunited without producer Frank Farian for the album ''[[Greatest Hits of All Times &ndash; Remix '88]]'' but tensions ran high between the members, and Liz Mitchell left in the spring of 1989 to be replaced by Madeleine Davis. While Mitchell promoted her solo album, the group recorded the single \"[[Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker]]\", without Farian's knowledge or approval. Threatened with legal action by the producer over the use of the Boney M. name, the single was subsequently withdrawn and Farian issued \"Stories\" with his own new Boney M. line-up featuring Liz Mitchell, Reggie Tsiboe and two new members, Sharon Stevens and Patty Onoyewenjo, \"Stories\" peaked at #11 in the Swiss charts. A second remix album ''[[Greatest Hits of All Times &ndash; Remix '89 &ndash; Volume II]]'' was released but fared poorly.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.'s music with the \"Boney M. Megamix\" single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. While Marcia Barrett, now residing in Florida, was battling cancer and unable to perform, Boney M. toured the world with a line-up of Liz Mitchell, Carol Grey, Patricia Lorna Foster and Curt Dee Daran (replaced by Tony Ashcroft in 1994). They released the single \u2018Papa Chico\u2019 but failed to chart. Maizie Williams assembled her own Boney M. line-up with her friend and short-time Boney M. member in the early days in 1975, [[Sheyla Bonnick]], and two others. Bobby Farrell also toured with three ever changing female performers.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:BoneyMwGoleniowie.jpg|right|thumb|Boney M. featuring Maizie Williams performing at a concert]]\nLiz Mitchell was touring the world with her line-up of Boney M., which is the only line-up officially supported by Farian (the court ruling of 1990 stated that all four members are entitled to perform their own Boney M. shows). Bobby Farrell and Liz Mitchell have released solo albums containing their own re-recordings of Boney M.'s classic hits. Maizie Williams released her first solo album in 2006 and her own single version of Boney M.'s \"Sunny\". In 2007 her rendition of 'Daddy Cool' with [[Melo-M]] hit the number one spot in the Latvian (LMK) Charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/318666-melom_maizie_williams_ar_videoklipu_daddy_cool_lmk_top10_pirmaja_vieta|title=Melo-M & Maizie Williams ar videoklipu \u201eDaddy Cool\u201d LMK TOP10 pirmaj\u0101 viet\u0101|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> Marcia Barrett has released two solo albums with a third scheduled for release in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maiziewilliams.com/ |title=Maizie Williams official website |publisher=Maiziewilliams.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref>\n\nAs recounted in his 1988 book ''[[Touching the Void (book)|Touching the Void]]'', the British climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]] was subsequently to find the catchy tune of \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" haunting him in the final hours of his struggle to survive the descent of [[Siula Grande]] in the [[Andes]], and the song was later used in the 2003 film of ''[[Touching the Void (film)|Touching the Void]]'' made by [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]]. Simpson recalls: \"I remember thinking, bloody hell, I'm going to die to Boney M\".\n\nA musical based on the music of Boney M., ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool]]'', opened in London in August 2006 to mixed reviews and sluggish ticket sales, causing it to close in February 2007. From April to July 2007, the show played in a mobile theatre in Berlin, which was specially designed for it.\n\nIn April 2007, Australian pop singer Peter Wilson released a song co-written by [[Frank Farian]] entitled \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#\"Doin' Fine\"|Doin' Fine]]\". It is described as \"paying tribute to the sound of Boney M.\" and features the famous string arrangement from their first number 1 hit, \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\".\n\nBoney M. (featuring Marcia Barrett) made a live appearance at the 37th [[International Film Festival of India]] (IFFI), which took place on 23 November 2006 in [[Panaji]], the state capital of [[Goa]], India. The group is also popular in the Vietnamese diaspora, {{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and was featured in Thuy Nga music productions.\n\nIn the UK, a new album of their greatest hits, entitled ''[[The Magic of Boney M.]]'' was released via [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] on 27 November 2006. Special additions to this release were a [[Mousse T.]] remix of \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\" and a brand new song from 2006, featuring Liz Mitchell, entitled \"A Moment of Love\".\n\nOn 10 April 2007, Boney M.'s first four albums were reissued on compact disc with bonus tracks, this time also in the United States (the first time these were available to the U.S. music market since their original releases in the 1970s).\n\nIn September 2007, Boney M.'s last four original albums, ''[[Boonoonoonoos]]'', ''[[Ten Thousand Lightyears]], [[Kalimba de Luna - 16 Happy Songs]]'' and ''[[Eye Dance]]'' were reissued on compact disc in Europe and the United States, all including bonus tracks. In November 2007, a new [[Christmas With Boney M. (2007 Edition)|Christmas compilation]] was scheduled for release as well as the DVD ''Fantastic Boney M. \u2013 On Stage and on the Road'' featuring a live performance recorded in Vienna on 1 November 1977 (the DVD cover erroneously states it to be a live show from Hamburg), and a film from the band's 1981 visit to [[Jamaica]] (made to promote the ''[[Boonoonoonoos]]'' album that year).\n\nBobby Farrell's Boney M. performed a concert at the Amphi in [[Ra'anana]], [[Israel]] in May 2007. On 28 June 2007 Boney M. featuring Matthew Felsenfeld and Liz Mitchell performed at the \"Oktiabrsky\" concert hall in St. Petersburg, Russia. In September 2007, Maizie Williams' Boney M. line-up performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, UK, to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Africa, performing her own renditions of \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" and \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday\".\n\nThe legal rights to the name \"Boney M.\" have been a matter of controversy, and even court cases, between the former members of the band and producer Frank Farian ever since the late 1980s. Farian, the man who in effect created the group, has continued to work with Liz Mitchell and her line-up all through the 1990s and 2000s. In January 2007, Zanillya Farrell (daughter of Bobby Farrell) and Yasmina Ayad-Saban (ex-wife of Farrell) renewed the trademark to the name Boney M. in Germany for a 10-year period.\n\nIn November 2008, French disco star [[Amanda Lear]] recorded a version of \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#\"Doin' Fine\"|Doin' Fine]]\" for her new studio album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prolificmedia.co.uk |title=PROLIFIC MEDIA GROUP UK \u2013 Music & Design Studio ::: Music Production &#124; Design &#124; Creative Consultancy &#124; A&R &#124; Publishing |publisher=Prolificmedia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006094108/http://www.prolificmedia.co.uk/ |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}</ref> which she announced on French television is scheduled for release in spring 2009.\n\nIn January 2009 [[Frank Farian]] released a brand new single called ''Felicidad America (Obama Obama)'' under the name-check ''Boney M. feat. Sherita O. & Yulee B.'' featuring two new vocalists. The song is a remake of the 1980 Boney M. classic [[Felicidad (Margherita)]] with new vocals and re-written lyrics now referring to the new US president [[Barack Obama]].\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn July 2010, Maizie Williams headlined a Boney M. performance at Ramallah's Cultural Palace, in the West Bank, as part of the Palestine International Festival. The band played \"Daddy Cool\", \"Ma Baker\" and \"Brown Girl in the Ring\", but refrained from playing \"Rivers of Babylon\", rumored to be at the event organizers' request because of its description of the Jewish yearning for Zion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthherzl.com/2010/07/despair-and-joy-24-hours-around.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914001759/http://www.thetruthherzl.com/2010/07/despair-and-joy-24-hours-around.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 September 2010|title=The Truth Herzl: Despair and Joy: 24 Hours Around Jerusalem|date=14 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://yuvalbenami.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-shall-we-sing-lords-song-in-strange.html |title=\"How Shall we Sing the Lord's Song in a Strange Land?\" on Everywhere by Yuval Ben Ami |publisher=Yuvalbenami.blogspot.com |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jH-40LukweU-pTqtUy8NewItYahQD9H43R900|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725100557/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jH-40LukweU-pTqtUy8NewItYahQD9H43R900|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 July 2010|title=The Associated Press: Boney M asked to skip hit in West Bank gig|date=25 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nBobby Farrell died at the age of 61 from heart failure on 30 December 2010.

A major DVD set was also released.\n\nIn February 2017, they performed at the closing ceremony of [[Patras Carnival]] in [[Patras]], [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Boney M at Patras Carnival|url=http://thegreekobserver.com/greece/lifestyle/article/877/boney-m-patras-carnival/|website=The Greek Observer|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== UK sales mark ==\nIn 1978, \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\", a cover of a track by [[The Melodians]] with lyrics partly based on [[Psalm 137]] and partly on Psalm 19,<ref>[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Psalms#Psalm 137|Psalm 137]] in the Bible (King James)</ref> became (at the time) the second highest-selling single of all time in the UK. After reaching No.1 for five weeks, \"Rivers of Babylon\" began dropping down the chart, at which point the [[B-side]] \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" was given extensive radio airplay, and the single climbed back up the chart to No. 2. The single spent six months in the UK Top 40, including 19 weeks in the Top 10. It eventually sold over two million copies, the second single to do so, and is still one of only 7 to achieve this feat. (see [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom]])\n\nThe group achieved a second UK million-seller with their version of the [[calypso music|calypso]] classic \"[[Mary's Boy Child]]\", released as a medley \"[[Mary's Boy Child \u2013 Oh My Lord]]\", which was previously a million-seller for [[Harry Belafonte]].

It is a loose [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968). The film is set in a [[dystopia]]n future [[Los Angeles]] of 2019, in which [[android (robot)|synthetic humans]] known as [[replicant]]s are [[bio-engineered]] by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on [[space colonization|off-world colonies]]. When a fugitive group of replicants led by [[Roy Batty]] (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop [[Rick Deckard]] (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down while questioning his and the replicants' humanity through his relationship with an advanced model, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]] (Young).\n\n''Blade Runner'' initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others were displeased with its unconventional pacing and plot. It later became an acclaimed [[cult film]] regarded as one of the [[Films considered the greatest ever|all-time best science fiction movies]]. Hailed for its production design depicting a \"[[retrofitted]]\" future, ''Blade Runner'' is a leading example of [[neo-noir]] cinema. The [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], composed by [[Vangelis]], was nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and a [[Golden Globe]] as best original [[film score|score]].\n\nThe film has influenced many science fiction films, [[video game]]s, [[anime]], and television series. It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and several later big-budget films were based on his work. In the year after its release, ''Blade Runner'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], and in 1993 it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".  A sequel, ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', was released in October 2017.\n\n[[Versions of Blade Runner|Seven versions of ''Blade Runner'']] exist as a result of controversial changes made at the request of studio executives. A [[director's cut]] was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a [[workprint]]. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on [[DVD]]. In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]]&nbsp;released ''[[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|The Final Cut]]'', a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, and the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Hatnote|Note: Since there are [[Versions of Blade Runner|several versions of ''Blade Runner'']], this summary excludes version-specific events.}}\n<!-- Note: The plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer [[Rick Deckard]] is detained by officer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Gaff|Gaff]], and brought to his former supervisor, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Harry Bryant|Bryant]]. Deckard, whose job as a \"blade runner\" was to track down bioengineered beings known as [[replicant]]s and \"retire\" (kill) them, is informed that four are on Earth illegally. Deckard starts to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him, and he stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dave Holden|Holden]] administering the \"Voigt-Kampff\" test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, [[Leon Kowalski|Leon]], shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 replicants: [[List of Blade Runner characters#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora Salome|Zhora]], and [[List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris]].\n\nBryant has Deckard meet with [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Eldon Tyrell]] so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]]. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an emotional \"cushion\".\n\nSearching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a synthetic snake scale. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[List of Blade Runner characters#J. F. Sebastian|J. F. Sebastian]], a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\n\nA photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him also to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol out of his hand, and attempts to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, making her kiss him.\n\nArriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris that the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of \"Methuselah Syndrome\", a genetic [[premature aging]] disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\", but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator, followed by Roy, who rides the elevator down alone.{{#tag:ref|Sebastian's death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film.<ref>Sammon, p. 175</ref>|group=nb}} Deckard is later told by Bryant that Sebastian was found dead.\n\nAt Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building, ending on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but is left hanging between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. Before Roy dies, he delivers a monologue about how his memories \"[[Tears in rain monologue|will be lost in time, like tears in rain]]\". Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael: \"It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?\" Deckard returns to his apartment and finds Rachael asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices an [[origami]] unicorn on the floor, a calling card that recalls for him Gaff's earlier statement. Deckard and Rachael leave the apartment block.\n\n== Themes ==\n{{Main|Themes in Blade Runner}}\nThe film operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs some of the conventions of [[film noir]], among them the character of a ''[[femme fatale]]''; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); [[chiaroscuro]] cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook&nbsp;\u2013 extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.<ref name=\"Barlow\">Barlow, Aaron \"Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K.

This tension between past, present, and future is represented in the \"retrofitted\" future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as \"extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel\". He also said that he \"liked the idea of exploring pain\" in the wake of his brother's death: \"When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.\"<ref name=\"scottobserver\">{{citation |last=Barber |first=Lynn |title=Scott's Corner |date=January 6, 2002 |url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,628186,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054223/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0%2C%2C628186%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-date=July 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored&nbsp;\u2013\nespecially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors.

The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy, while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal.

Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',<ref name=\"NSVan\">{{citation |author=Vangelis |author-link=Vangelis |title=Blade Runner&nbsp;\u2013 Scoring the music |work=NemoStudios.co.uk |url= http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131019015508/http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013}}{{self-published source |date=February 2018 |reason=This SPS is permissible per WP:ABOUTSELF.}}</ref> composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.<ref>Sammon, pp. 271\u2013274</ref> He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].<ref name=\"FutureNoir-p419\">Sammon, pp. 419\u2013423</ref> Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo \"Love Theme\" by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used \"Memories of Green\" from the Vangelis album ''[[See You Later]], ''an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]''.<ref>{{citation |last=Larsen |first=Peter |title=Film music |publisher=[[Reaktion Books]] |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-86189-341-3 |page=179}}</ref>\n\nAlong with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's soundscape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia&nbsp;\u2013 \"Ogi no Mato\" or \"The Folding Fan as a Target\" from the Nonesuch Records release ''Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music''&nbsp;\u2013 and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from \"Harps of the Ancient Temples\" on Laurel Records.<ref>Sammon, p. 424</ref>\n\nDespite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from [[Polydor Records]] in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.<ref name=\"FutureNoir-p419\" />\n\nThese delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 \"Off World Music, Ltd\" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.<ref name=\"FutureNoir-p419\" /> A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.<ref>{{citation |url= http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=July 27, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200702/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film's special effects are generally recognized to be among the best of all time,<ref>{{citation |url= http://whatculture.com/film/10-pre-2000-movies-special-effects-still-hold-today.php/11 |title=10 Pre-2000 Movies with Special Effects That Still Hold up Today |work=WhatCulture.com |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102231/http://whatculture.com/film/10-pre-2000-movies-special-effects-still-hold-today.php/11 |archive-date=May 18, 2015|date=February 23, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"adamsavage\">{{citation |url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a1775/4218376/ |title=Blade Runner at 25: Why the Sci-Fi F/X Are Still Unsurpassed |first=Adam |last=Savage |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130018/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a1775/4218376/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015|date=July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://www.empireonline.com/features/cinemas-greatest-vfx-shots/p6 |title=Los Angeles 2019 (Blade Runner)&nbsp;\u2013 Cinema's Greatest Effects Shots Picked by Hollywood's Top VFX Specialists |work=Empire |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075420/http://www.empireonline.com/features/cinemas-greatest-vfx-shots/p6 |archive-date=May 18, 2015|date=October 2, 2015 }}</ref> using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest.

The modern beef breed was developed in the 1950s by Professor Hanset, working at an [[artificial insemination]] centre in [[Liege (province)|Liege]] province. The breed's characteristic gene mutation was maintained through [[Linebreeding#Domestic animals|linebreeding]] to the point where the condition was a fixed property in the Belgian Blue breed.<ref name=Kambadur /> In 1978, Belgian Blue cattle were introduced to the United States by Nick Tutt, a farmer from central Canada who immigrated to [[West Texas]] and showed the cattle to universities in the region.{{Clarify|date=July 2015}}\n\n== Breed characteristics ==\nThe Belgian Blue has a natural [[mutation]] in the [[myostatin]] gene which codes for the protein, [[myostatin]] (\"myo\" meaning muscle and \"statin\" meaning stop).<ref name=Kambadur />  Myostatin is a protein that inhibits muscle development. This mutation also interferes with fat deposition, resulting in very lean meat.<ref name=Kambadur /> The truncated myostatin gene is unable to function in its normal capacity, resulting in accelerated lean muscle growth. Muscle growth is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. This particular type of growth is seen early in the fetus of a pregnant dam, which results in a calf that is born with two times the number of muscle fibers at birth than a calf with no myostatin gene mutation.<ref name=Kambadur /> In addition, a newborn double-muscled calf's birth weight is significantly greater than that of a normal calf.<ref name=\"De Smet\"/>\n\nBelgian Blue cattle have improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) due to lower feed intake compared to weight gain<ref name=\"De Smet\" />  due to an altered composition of body weight gain which includes increased protein and decreased fat deposition.<ref name=\"De Smet\" /> The Belgian Blue's bone structure is the same as normal cattle, albeit holding a greater amount of muscle, which causes them to have a greater meat to bone ratio. These cattle have a muscle yield around 20% more on average than cattle without the genetic myostatin mutation.<ref name=Kambadur /> Because of this breed's increased muscle yield, a diet containing higher protein is required to compensate for the altered mode of weight gain.<ref name=\"De Smet\" /> During finishing, this breed requires high-energy (concentrated) feeds, and will not yield the same results if put on a high-fiber diet.<ref name=\"De Smet\" />\n\nThe value of the double-muscling breed is due to their superior carcass characteristics. However, with decreased fat content is decreased marbling of meat, which means the meat tenderness is reduced. Conversely, the Belgian Blue's meat tenderness has been argued to be just as tender because a large number of smaller muscle fibers are present.{{citation needed|reason=Argued by whom?|date=July 2015}} <!-- FACT? The Belgian Blue's meat cuts also have a lower collagen content, which allows the protein quality to be improved due to a higher yield of amino acids.<ref name=\"De Smet\" />\n -->\n\n== Breed problems ==\nDouble-muscled cows can experience [[dystocia]] (a difficult birth), even when bred to normal beef bulls or dairy bulls, because of a narrower birth canal.{{r|norm|page=256}}  In addition to the dam's reduced pelvic dimensions, the calf's birth weight and width are increased, making parturition harder.<ref name=Kambadur /> The [[:wikt:neonatal|neonatal]] calf is so large that [[Caesarean section]]s are routinely scheduled for breeders.{{r|norm|page=256}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Educational Vet Video|title=Video of Cow Caesarean Section|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2HJNAgoels|work=VetPulse TV in Practice|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The bull's testicular weight and [[semen]] quantity and quality have been observed as reduced, however this seems to be less of an issue when compared to the dam's difficulties in calving.<ref name=\"De Smet\" />\n\n== Economic efficiency ==\nThe economics of breeding and raising Belgian Blue cattle are inconclusive because of complications experienced during parturition and metabolic demand for increased concentrated feeds. The breed's increased need to have Caesarean sections when calving means increased cost and added work, and can become a welfare issue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, the carcass value of double-muscled animals may be enhanced due to increased dressing yield, lean carcass content, and upgrading of some cuts leading to a higher proportion of higher valued cuts.<ref name=\"De Smet\" />  The slower rate of fat deposition causes slaughtering to be delayed in most cases, which means an increase in maintenance costs in those animals. Belgian Blue cattle require more skilled management and do not thrive in harsh environments.<ref name=\"De Smet\" />  For these reasons and others, the breed's overall production efficiency in an economic sense is still unclear.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=dad>[http://dad.fao.org/cgi-bin/EfabisWeb.cgi?sid=0b1613ebf16355cf65f6a05b9a65fe25,reportsreport8a_50000612 Blanc-Bleu Belge/Belgium].

These are mined industrially as [[evaporite]]s, such as [[borax]] and [[kernite]]. The largest known boron deposits are in [[Turkey]], the largest producer of boron minerals.\n\nElemental boron is a [[metalloid]] that is found in small amounts in [[meteoroid]]s but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several [[allotropes of boron]] exist: [[amorphous]] boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]), and a poor [[electrical conductor]] at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as [[boron filament]]s with applications similar to [[carbon fibers]] in some high-strength materials.\n\nBoron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all boron consumed globally is an additive in [[fiberglass]] for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in [[polymers]] and [[ceramic]]s in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. [[Borosilicate glass]] is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron as [[sodium perborate]] is used as a [[bleach]]. A small amount of boron is used as a [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]]s, and [[reagents|reagent]] intermediates in the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic fine chemicals]]. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which ([[boron-10]]) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.\n\nIn biology, [[borate]]s have low toxicity in mammals (similar to [[table salt]]), but are more toxic to [[arthropod]]s and are used as [[insecticides]]. [[Boric acid]] is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known.<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/antibiotics1968/48/1/48_1_26/_article|title = The tartrolons, new boron-containing antibiotics from a myxobacterium, ''Sorangium cellulosum''|journal = The Journal of Antibiotics|volume = 48|issue = 1|pages = 26\u201330|pmid=7532644|vauthors=Irschik H, Schummer D, Gerth K, H\u00f6fle G, Reichenbach H |year = 1995|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.48.26}}</ref> Boron is an essential plant nutrient and boron compounds such as borax and [[boric acid]] are used as [[fertilizer]]s in [[agriculture]], although it only required in small amounts, with excess being toxic. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although there is some evidence it supports bone health.\n\n==History==\nThe word ''boron'' was coined from ''[[borax]]'', the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with ''carbon'', which boron resembles chemically.\n[[File:Sassolite.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|[[Sassolite]]]]\n\nBorax, its mineral form then known as tincal, glazes were used in [[China]] from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Perso-Arab alchemist [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]] apparently mentioned it in AD 700. [[Marco Polo]] brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in [[metallurgy]]. In 1777, [[boric acid]] was recognized in the hot springs ([[soffioni]]) near [[Florence]], Italy, and became known as ''sal sedativum'', with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called [[sassolite]], which is found at Sasso, [[Italy]]. Sasso was the main source of [[Europe]]an borax from 1827 to 1872, when [[United States|American]] sources replaced it.<ref name=borates>{{Cite book|pages=102; 385\u2013386|title=Borates: handbook of deposits, processing, properties, and use| author = Garrett, Donald E.| publisher =Academic Press| date= 1998| isbn=978-0-12-276060-0}}</ref><ref name=boron>{{cite web| accessdate= 2009-05-05| url = http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm| title = Boron|publisher=University of Denver|author=Calvert, J.

These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.<ref name=\"HollemanAF\"/>\n\nThe trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s in that they readily form [[adduct]]s with electron-pair donors, which are called [[Lewis base]]s. For example, fluoride (F<sup>\u2212</sup>) and [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>) combined to give the [[tetrafluoroborate]] anion, BF<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form [[boric acid]].<ref name=\"HollemanAF\"/>\n\nBoron is found in nature on Earth almost entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred [[borate mineral]]s contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral [[borax]], shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) in borax.<ref name=\"HollemanAF\"/> The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number   of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.<ref>http://www.mindat.org</ref>\n\n{{Main|Boranes}}\n\nBoranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH<sub>3</sub> is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B<sub>20</sub>H<sub>26</sub> are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.\n\nThe most important boranes are diborane B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub> and decaborane B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>.\n\nThe formal [[oxidation number]] in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as \u22121 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>, it is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>5</sub> or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.\n\n{{Main|Boron nitride}}\n\nThe [[boron nitride]]s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various [[allotropes of carbon]], including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename [[Borazon]]), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a [[coordinate covalent bond]], wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the [[Lewis base]] to a bond to the [[Lewis acid]]ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.<ref name=dkg>{{cite journal| title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) \u2013 Applications from Metallurgy to Cosmetics| url = http://www.esk.com/uploads/tx_userjspresseveroeff/PR_0712_CFI_12-2007_Hexagonales-BN_e_01.pdf| author =Engler, M. | journal = Cfi/Ber.

Many are produced from [[hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], which employs [[diborane]],  B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, a simple [[borane]] chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, [[tetraphenylborate]], [B(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> vs. [[triphenylborane]], B(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.\n\nOrganoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as [[boron carbide]] (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to [[carborane]]s, carbon-boron [[cluster chemistry]] compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including [[carborane acid]], a [[superacid]]. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for [[boron neutron capture therapy]] for cancer.\n\n=====Compounds of B(I) and B(II)=====\nAlthough these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in [[borane|boron hydrides]] and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N<sub>2</sub>, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but [[diboron tetrafluoride|B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>]] and B<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> are well characterized.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>\n[[File:Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride.

Each boron atom has a formal \u22121 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in [[graphite]]. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite.

The mass difference results in a wide range of \u03b4<sup>11</sup>B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the <sup>11</sup>B and <sup>10</sup>B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from \u221216 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is <sup>7</sup>B which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.5\u00d710<sup>\u221222</sup> s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)<sub>3</sub> and [[tetrahydroxyborate|[B(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>]].

Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.\n\nIncreasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity.

The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of [[silica]], which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.\n\nThe highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for \"Electrical\" use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics.

This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with [[empirical formula]] B<sub>12</sub>C<sub>3</sub> (i.e., with B<sub>12</sub> dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C<sub>3</sub> units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B<sub>6</sub>) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in [[vehicle armour|tank armor]], [[bulletproof vest]]s, and numerous other structural applications.\n\nBoron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.<ref>{{Cite book| first = Alan W.|last = Weimer| title = Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials Synthesis and Processing| isbn = 978-0-412-54060-8| date = 1997| publisher = Chapman & Hall (London, New York)}}</ref>\n\n===High-hardness and abrasive compounds===\n{{Main|Superhard materials}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:30px; text-align:center; float:right;\"\n|+ Mechanical properties of BCN solids<ref>{{Cite journal| title = Ultimate Metastable Solubility of Boron in Diamond: Synthesis of Superhard Diamondlike BC5| first = V.

It is the third-lightest [[halogen]], and is a fuming red-brown [[liquid]] at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. Isolated independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob L\u00f6wig]] (in 1825) and [[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard]] (in 1826), its name was derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03b2\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (\"stench\"), referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.\n\nElemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur [[free element|free]] in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide [[Ionic salt|salts]], analogous to [[table salt]]. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br<sup>\u2212</sup>) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from [[brine]] pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.\n\nAt high temperatures, [[organobromine compound]]s readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops [[free radical]] chemical [[chain reaction]]s. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as [[fire retardant]]s, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet [[sunlight]] to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the [[atmosphere]] to yield free bromine atoms, causing [[ozone depletion]]. As a result, many organobromide compounds\u2014such as the [[pesticide]] [[Bromomethane|methyl bromide]]\u2014are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in [[well drilling fluids]], in [[photographic film]], and as an intermediate in the manufacture of [[organic compound|organic]] chemicals.\n\nLarge amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ion, causing [[bromism]]. However, a clear biological role for bromide ion and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated, and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans. The role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer. As a [[pharmaceutical]], the simple bromide ion (Br<sup>\u2212</sup>) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as [[antiepileptic]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Balard]], one of the discoverers of bromine]]\nBromine was discovered independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob L\u00f6wig]]<ref name=L1/> and [[Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard|Antoine Balard]],<ref name=\"Bal1826\"/><ref name=\"Balard\"/> in 1825 and 1826, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The discovery of the elements: XVII.

L\u00f6wig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with [[diethyl ether]]. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.<ref name=\"L\u00f6wig\" />\n\nBalard found bromine chemicals in the ash of [[seaweed]] from the [[salt marsh]]es of [[Montpellier]]. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried to prove that the substance was [[iodine monochloride]] (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''muria'' for brine.<ref name=\"Balard\" />\n\nAfter the French chemists [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], [[Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard]], and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] and published in ''Annales de Chimie et Physique''.<ref name=\"Bal1826\" /> In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from ''muride'' to ''br\u00f4me'' on the proposal of M.

Its properties are thus similar to those of [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[iodine]], and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration [Ar]3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>4p<sup>5</sup>, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its [[valence electron]]s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell.<ref name=Greenwood800>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800\u20134</ref> Corresponding to [[periodic trend]]s, it is intermediate in [[electronegativity]] between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the [[bromide]] ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride.<ref name=Greenwood800/> These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], whose work foreshadowed the [[periodic law]] for chemical elements.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web | title = Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner| publisher = Purdue University| date = | url = http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114215946/http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2014-11-14| accessdate = 2008-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Historic Overview: Mendeleev and the Periodic Table | publisher = NASA| date = | url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/UnderElem/UnderElem_pdf/HistOverST.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}</ref> It is intermediate in [[atomic radius]] between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first [[ionisation energy]], [[electron affinity]], enthalpy of dissociation of the X<sub>2</sub> molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X\u2013X bond length.<ref name=Greenwood800/> The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.<ref name=Greenwood793>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 793\u20134</ref>\n\nAll four stable halogens experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s of attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure.<ref name=Greenwood800/> The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at \u22127.2&nbsp;\u00b0C and boils at 58.8&nbsp;\u00b0C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group.<ref name=Greenwood800/> Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''\u03c0<sub>g</sub>'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''\u03c3<sub>u</sub>'' molecular orbital.<ref name=Greenwood804>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804\u20139</ref> The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at \u2212195&nbsp;\u00b0C is pale yellow.<ref name=Greenwood800/>\n\nLike solid chlorine and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the [[orthorhombic crystal system]], in a layered lattice of Br<sub>2</sub> molecules. The Br\u2013Br distance is 227&nbsp;pm (close to the gaseous Br\u2013Br distance of 228&nbsp;pm) and the Br\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br distance between molecules is 331&nbsp;pm within a layer and 399&nbsp;pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195&nbsp;pm). This structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221213</sup>&nbsp;\u03a9<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> just below the melting point, although this is better than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.<ref name=Greenwood800/>\n\nAt a pressure of 55&nbsp;[[GPa]] (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition.

Both have nuclear spin 3/2\u2212 and thus may be used for [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], although <sup>81</sup>Br is more favourable. The relatively 1:1 distribution of the two isotopes in nature is helpful in identification of bromine containing compounds using mass spectroscopy. Other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with [[half-life|half-lives]] too short to occur in nature.

Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the [[standard electrode potential]]s of the X<sub>2</sub>/X<sup>\u2212</sup> couples (F, +2.866&nbsp;V; Cl, +1.395&nbsp;V; Br, +1.087&nbsp;V; I, +0.615&nbsp;V; At, approximately +0.3&nbsp;V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M\u2013M, M\u2013H, or M\u2013C bonds to form M\u2013Br bonds.<ref name=Greenwood804/>\n\n===Hydrogen bromide===\nThe simplest compound of bromine is [[hydrogen bromide]], HBr. It is mainly used in the production of inorganic [[bromide]]s and [[alkyl bromide]]s, and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry. Industrially, it is mainly produced by the reaction of [[hydrogen]] gas with bromine gas at 200\u2013400&nbsp;\u00b0C with a [[platinum]] catalyst. However, reduction of bromine with [[red phosphorus]] is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory:<ref name=Greenwood809>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809\u201312</ref>\n: 2 P + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + 3 Br<sub>2</sub> \u2192 6 HBr + 2 H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>\n: H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Br<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 HBr + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>\n\nAt room temperature, hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.<ref name=Greenwood809/> Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as [[hydrobromic acid]], which is a strong acid (p''K''<sub>a</sub> = \u22129) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H<sub>2</sub>O system also involves many hydrates HBr\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine [[anion]]s and [[hydronium]] [[cation]]s. Hydrobromic acid forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 124.3&nbsp;\u00b0C at 47.63&nbsp;g HBr per 100&nbsp;g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.<ref name=Greenwood812>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812\u20136</ref>\n\nUnlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H<sub>2</sub>Br<sup>+</sup> and {{chem|HBr|2|-}} ions \u2013 the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs<sup>+</sup>]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu<sup>''n''</sup>]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.<ref name=Greenwood812/>\n\n===Other binary bromides===\n[[File:Bromid st\u0159\u00edbrn\u00fd.PNG|thumb|right|[[Silver bromide]] (AgBr)]]\nNearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es, with the exception of [[xenon]] in the very unstable XeBr<sub>2</sub>); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[fluorine]], and [[chlorine]]), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, nitrides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen tribromide]] is named as a bromide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)<ref name=Greenwood821>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821\u20134</ref>\n\nBromination of metals with Br<sub>2</sub> tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with Cl<sub>2</sub> when a variety of oxidation states is available. Bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrobromic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, [[carbon tetrabromide]], or an organic bromide. For example, [[niobium(V) oxide]] reacts with carbon tetrabromide at 370&nbsp;\u00b0C to form [[niobium(V) bromide]].<ref name=Greenwood821/> Another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess \"halogenating reagent\", for example:<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n:FeCl<sub>3</sub> + BBr<sub>3</sub> (excess) \u2192 FeBr<sub>3</sub> + BCl<sub>3</sub>\nWhen a lower bromide is wanted, either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent, or thermal decomposition or [[disproportionation]] may be used, as follows:<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n: 3 WBr<sub>5</sub> + Al {{overunderset|\u2192|thermal gradient|475\u00b0C \u2192 240\u00b0C}} 3 WBr<sub>4</sub> + AlBr<sub>3</sub>\n: EuBr<sub>3</sub> + {{sfrac|1|2}} H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 EuBr<sub>2</sub> + HBr\n: 2 TaBr<sub>4</sub> {{overunderset|\u2192|500\u00b0C|&nbsp;}} TaBr<sub>3</sub> + TaBr<sub>5</sub>\n\nMost of the bromides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. [[Silver bromide]] is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\n===Bromine halides===\nThe halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY<sub>3</sub>, XY<sub>5</sub>, and XY<sub>7</sub> (where X is heavier than Y), and bromine is no exception. Bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride, as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride. Some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as {{chem|BrF|2|-}}, {{chem|BrCl|2|-}}, {{chem|BrF|2|+}}, {{chem|BrF|4|+}}, and {{chem|BrF|6|+}}. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen bromide]] (BrCN), bromine [[thiocyanate]] (BrSCN), and bromine [[azide]] (BrN<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Greenwood824>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824\u20138</ref>\n\nThe pale-brown [[bromine monofluoride]] (BrF) is unstable at room temperature, disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct reaction of the elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures.<ref name=Greenwood824/> [[Bromine monochloride]] (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though it can be made by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in [[carbon tetrachloride]].<ref name=Greenwood821/> Bromine monofluoride in [[ethanol]] readily leads to the monobromination of the [[aromaticity|aromatic]] compounds PhX (''para''-bromination occurs for X = Me, Bu<sup>''t''</sup>, OMe, Br; ''meta''-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = \u2013CO<sub>2</sub>Et, \u2013CHO, \u2013NO<sub>2</sub>); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br\u2013F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Greenwood821/>\n\nAt room temperature, [[bromine trifluoride]] (BrF<sub>3</sub>) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than [[chlorine trifluoride]]. It reacts vigorously with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[silicon]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], iodine, and [[sulfur]] to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, it is used to oxidise [[uranium]] to [[uranium hexafluoride]] in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF<sub>4</sub> and BrF<sub>2</sub>SbF<sub>6</sub> remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form {{chem|BrF|2|+}} and {{chem|BrF|4|-}} and thus conducts electricity.<ref name=Greenwood828>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828\u201331</ref>\n\n[[Bromine pentafluoride]] (BrF<sub>5</sub>) was first synthesised in 1930. It is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150&nbsp;\u00b0C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of [[potassium bromide]] at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Greenwood832>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832\u20135</ref>\n\n===Polybromine compounds===\nAlthough dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, very strong oxidisers such as [[peroxydisulfuryl fluoride]] (S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) can oxidise it to form the cherry-red {{chem|Br|2|+}} cation. A few other bromine cations are known, namely the brown {{chem|Br|3|+}} and dark brown {{chem|Br|5|+}}.<ref name=Greenwood842>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842\u20134</ref> The tribromide anion, {{chem|Br|3|-}}, has also been characterised; it is analogous to [[triiodide]].<ref name=Greenwood824/>\n\n===Bromine oxides and oxoacids===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ Standard reduction potentials for aqueous Br species<ref name=Greenwood853/>\n! {{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(H<sup>+</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(acid)!!{{nowrap|E\u00b0(couple)}}!!{{nowrap|''a''(OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) {{=}} 1}}<br>(base)\n|-\n|Br<sub>2</sub>/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+1.052|||Br<sub>2</sub>/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+1.065\n|-\n|HOBr/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+1.341||BrO<sup>\u2212</sup>/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.760\n|-\n|{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+1.399||{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.584\n|-\n|HOBr/Br<sub>2</sub>||+1.604||BrO<sup>\u2212</sup>/Br<sub>2</sub>||+0.455\n|-\n|{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/Br<sub>2</sub>||+1.478||{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/Br<sub>2</sub>||+0.485\n|-\n|{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/HOBr||+1.447||{{chem|BrO|3|-}}/BrO<sup>\u2212</sup>||+0.492\n|-\n|{{chem|BrO|4|-}}/{{chem|BrO|3|-}}||+1.853||{{chem|BrO|4|-}}/{{chem|BrO|3|-}}||+1.025\n|}\n[[Bromine oxide]]s are not as well-characterised as [[chlorine oxide]]s or [[iodine oxide]]s, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought that they could not exist at all.

It is thermally unstable above \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C, violently decomposing to its elements at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. [[Dibromine trioxide]], ''syn''-BrOBrO<sub>2</sub>, is also known; it is the anhydride of [[hypobromous acid]] and [[bromic acid]]. It is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C; if heated too rapidly, it explodes around 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. A few other unstable radical oxides are also known, as are some poorly characterised oxides, such as [[dibromine pentoxide]], tribromine octoxide, and bromine trioxide.<ref name=Greenwood850/>\n\nThe four [[oxoacid]]s, [[hypobromous acid]] (HOBr), [[bromous acid]] (HOBrO), [[bromic acid]] (HOBrO<sub>2</sub>), and [[perbromic acid]] (HOBrO<sub>3</sub>), are better studied due to their greater stability, though they are only so in aqueous solution. When bromine dissolves in aqueous solution, the following reactions occur:<ref name=Greenwood853>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853\u20139</ref>\n:{|\n|-\n| Br<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || {{eqm}} HOBr + H<sup>+</sup> + Br<sup>\u2212</sup> || ''K''<sub>ac</sub> = 7.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup> mol<sup>2</sup> l<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n| Br<sub>2</sub> + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup> || {{eqm}} OBr<sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Br<sup>\u2212</sup> || ''K''<sub>alk</sub> = 2 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> mol<sup>\u22121</sup> l\n|}\n\nHypobromous acid is unstable to disproportionation.

Unlike chlorates, which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perclorate, the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions. Bromic acid is a strong acid. Bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows:<ref name=Greenwood862/>\n:{{chem|BrO|3|-}} + 5 Br<sup>\u2212</sup> + 6 H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 3 Br<sub>2</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThere were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid, leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist, until 1968 when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive [[beta decay]] of unstable {{chem|83|Se|O|4|2-}}. Today, perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas. Excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as [[silver bromate]] and [[calcium fluoride]], and the perbromic acid solution may be purified. The perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising, with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it, such as fluorine or [[xenon difluoride]]. The Br\u2013O bond in {{chem|BrO|4|-}} is fairly weak, which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements (especially [[arsenic]], [[selenium]], and bromine) to attain their maximum possible oxidation state, as they come after the [[scandide contraction]] characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals.<ref name=Greenwood871>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 871\u20132</ref>\n\n===Organobromine compounds===\n{{main|Organobromine compound}}\n[[File:N-Bromosuccinimide.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]], a common brominating reagent in organic chemistry]]\nLike the other carbon\u2013halogen bonds, the C\u2013Br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine (2.96) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C\u2013Br bond is electron-deficient and thus [[electrophilic]].

This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of the chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.<ref name=Greenwood798>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 798\u20139</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nA wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in [[industry]].

When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces [[hydrobromic acid]] which interferes in the radical [[chain reaction]] of the [[oxidation]] reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 14|pages = 426\u2013442| date = 1996|doi = 10.1177/073490419601400602|title = Mechanisms for Flame Retardancy and Smoke suppression \u2013 A Review|first =Joseph|last = Green|issue = 6 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume = 77|date = 2002|pages = 325\u2013331| doi = 10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8|title = Fire retardant mechanism of aliphatic bromine compounds in polystyrene and polypropylene|first = Jelle|last = Kaspersma|author2 = Doumena, Cindy|author3 = Munrob Sheilaand|author4 = Prinsa, Anne-Marie|issue = 2}}</ref>\n\nTo make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during [[polymerisation]]. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, [[vinyl bromide]] can be used in the production of [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] or [[polypropylene]]. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, [[tetrabromobisphenol A]] can be added to [[polyester]]s or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in [[printed circuit board]]s are normally made from such flame retardant [[resin]]s, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products ([[FR-4]] and [[FR-2]]).

It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery [[alkaline earth metal]]. Because of its high chemical [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern times as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]], does not occur as a [[mineral]], but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.\n\nThe most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are [[Baryte|barite]] (now called baryte<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-549.html |website=www.mindat.org |title=Baryte: Baryte mineral information and data.}}</ref><ref>http://nrmima.nrm.se</ref>) ([[barium sulfate]], BaSO<sub>4</sub>) and [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]], BaCO<sub>3</sub>), both insoluble in water. The name ''barium'' originates from the alchemical derivative \"baryta\", from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (''barys''), meaning \"heavy.\" ''Baric'' is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of [[electrolysis]].\n\nBarium has few industrial applications.  Historically, it was used as a [[getter]] for [[vacuum tube]]s and in oxide form as the emissive coating on [[Hot cathode#Oxide-coated cathodes|indirectly heated cathodes]]. It is a component of [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]] ([[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]]) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. [[Barium sulfate]] is used as an insoluble additive to [[oil well]] [[drilling fluid]], as well as in a purer form, as X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]]s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium [[ion]] and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as [[rodenticide]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:Barium 1.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized barium]]\nBarium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure.<ref name=\"Ullman2005\">{{cite book |author=Kresse, Robert |author2=Baudis, Ulrich |author3=J\u00e4ger, Paul |author4=Riechers, H.

It is a member of the [[actinide]] and [[transuranium element]] series. It is named after the city of [[Berkeley, California]], the location of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[curium]] and [[americium]].\n\nThe major [[isotope]] of berkelium, <sup>249</sup>Bk, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux [[nuclear reactor]]s, mainly at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]], USA, and at the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. The production of the second-most important isotope <sup>247</sup>Bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope [[curium-244|<sup>244</sup>Cm]] with high-energy [[alpha particle]]s.\n\nJust over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinide]]s. A 22&nbsp;milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element [[tennessine]] for the first time in 2009 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Russia]], after it was bombarded with [[calcium-48]] ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia\u2013US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.\n\nBerkelium is a soft, silvery-white, [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy [[electron]]s and thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a [[half-life]] of 330&nbsp;days to [[californium]]-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical===\n[[File:Closest packing ABAC.png|thumb|Double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC in the crystal structure of \u03b1-berkelium (A: green, B: blue, C: red)|alt=Sequential layers of spheres arranged from top to bottom: GRGBGRGB (G=green, R=red, B=blue)]]\n\nBerkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive [[actinide]] metal. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[curium]], to the left of the actinide [[californium]] and below the lanthanide [[terbium]] with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties.

Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue [[europium]], and curium honored scientists [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as the lanthanide above it, [[gadolinium]], was named after the explorer of the [[rare earth element]]s [[Johan Gadolin]]. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: \"It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue [[terbium]] (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of [[Ytterby]], [[Sweden]], where the rare earth minerals were first found.\"<ref name=\"E97\"/> This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, [[californium]], was not related to its lanthanide analogue [[dysprosium]], but after the discovery place.<ref>{{cite book|last = Heiserman|first = David L.|year = 1992|title = Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 0-8306-3018-X|chapter = Element 98: Californium|ref = CITEREFHeiserman1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24l-Cpal9oIC|page=347}}</ref>\n\nThe most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium (<sup>241</sup>Am) [[nitrate]] solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to [[americium dioxide]] (AmO<sub>2</sub>). This target was irradiated with 35&nbsp;MeV [[alpha particle]]s for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (\u03b1,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the <sup>243</sup>Bk isotope and two free [[neutron]]s:<ref name=\"E97\"/>\n\n:<chem>^{241}_{95}Am + ^{4}_{2}He -> ^{243}_{97}Bk + 2^{1}_{0}n</chem>\n\nAfter the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]] and then precipitated as the [[hydroxide]] using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The product was [[centrifugation|centrifugated]] and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of [[ammonium]] and [[ammonium sulfate]] and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the [[oxidation state]] +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of [[hydrofluoric acid]] as americium(III) [[fluoride]] ({{chem|AmF|3}}). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with [[potassium hydroxide]], and after centrifugation, was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]].<ref name=\"E97\"/>\n\n[[File:Elutionskurven Tb Gd Eu und Bk Cm Am.png|thumb|[[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] [[elution]] curves revealing the similarity between the lanthanides [[terbium]] (Tb), [[gadolinium]] (Gd), and [[europium]] (Eu) (top graph) and their corresponding actinides berkelium (Bk), [[curium]] (Cm), and [[americium]] (Am) (bottom graph)<ref name = \"E97\"/>|alt=Graphs showing similar elution curves (metal amount vs. drops) for (top vs. bottom) terbium vs. berkelium, gadolinium vs. curium, europium vs. americium]]\nFurther separation was carried out in the presence of a [[citric acid]]/[[ammonium]] [[buffer solution]] in a weakly acidic medium ([[pH]]\u22483.5), using [[ion exchange]] at elevated temperature.

These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various inorganic oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as [[bromate]]s ({{chem|BrO|3|-}}), [[bismuthate]]s ({{chem|BiO|3|-}}), [[chromate]]s ({{chem|CrO|4|2-}} and Cr{{su|b=2}}O{{su|b=7|p=2\u2212}}), silver(I) thiolate ({{chem|Ag|2|S|2|O|8}}), lead(IV) oxide ({{chem|PbO|2}}), [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), or photochemical oxidation procedures. More recently, it has been discovered that some organic and bio-inspired molecules, such as the chelator called 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), can also oxidize Bk(III) and stabilize Bk(IV) under mild conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deblonde |first1=Gauthier |last2=Sturzbecher-Hoehne |first2=Manuel |last3=Rupert |first3=Peter |last4=An |first4=Dahlia |last5=Illy |first5=Marie-Claire |last6=Ralston |first6=Corie |last7=brabec |first7=Jiri |last8=de Jong |first8=Wibe |last9=Strong |first9=Roland |last10=Abergel |first10=Rebecca |title=Chelation and stabilization of berkelium in oxidation state +IV |journal=Nature Chemistry |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=843\u2013849 |doi=10.1038/nchem.2759 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2759 |accessdate=22 July 2018|bibcode=2017NatCh...9..843D }}</ref>  Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with [[ion exchange]], extraction [[chromatography]] or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), [[amine]]s, [[tributyl phosphate]] or various other reagents.

The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126&nbsp;keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a [[glove box]] in a dedicated laboratory.<ref>Emeleus, H.

They were formed by lateritization of various [[Silicate#Silicate rock|silicate rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[basalt]], [[syenite]], and [[shale]].  In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the [[kaolinite]] and the precipitation of the [[gibbsite]].  Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] surface layer.  The [[aluminium hydroxide]] in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.\n\nIn the case of Jamaica, recent analysis of the soils showed elevated levels of [[cadmium]], suggesting that the bauxite originates from recent [[Miocene]] [[Volcanic ash|ash]] deposits from episodes of significant volcanism in Central America.\n\n==Production trends==\n{{See also|List of countries by bauxite production}}\n[[File:2005bauxite.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Bauxite output in 2005]]\n[[File:Weipa-bauxite-mine.jpg|thumb|One of the world's largest bauxite mines in [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]], Australia]]\nAustralia is the largest producer of bauxite, followed by China.<ref name=usgs>{{Cite book|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/mcs-2018-bauxi.pdf|title=U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries, January 2018|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=30-31}}</ref> In 2017, China was the top producer of aluminium with almost half of the world's production, followed by Russia, Canada, and India.<ref>https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/aluminum/mcs-2017-alumi.pdf</ref> Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/mcs-2012-bauxi.pdf| title=Bauxite and Alumina |format=PDF | publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] | page=2 | accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>  Increased [[aluminium recycling]], which has the advantage of lowering the cost in [[electric power]] in producing aluminium, will considerably extend the world's bauxite reserves.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ 2017 total proven bauxite reserves x1,000 [[Metric Tonne|Mg]]<ref name=usgs/>\n!

At these temperatures, the [[aluminium]] is dissolved as [[sodium aluminate]] (the [[Bayer process]]). The aluminium compounds in the bauxite may be present as [[gibbsite]](Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>), [[boehmite]](AlOOH) or [[diaspore]](AlOOH); the different forms of the aluminium component will dictate the extraction conditions. The undissolved waste, [[bauxite tailings]], after the aluminium compounds are extracted contains [[iron oxides]], [[silica]], [[calcia]], [[Titanium dioxide|titania]] and some un-reacted [[alumina]]. After separation of the residue by filtering, pure gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled, and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide. The gibbsite is usually converted into [[aluminium oxide]], Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, by heating in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to a temperature in excess of 1000<sup>o</sup>C. This aluminium oxide is dissolved at a temperature of about 960 \u00b0C in molten [[cryolite]]. Next, this molten substance can yield metallic aluminium by passing an [[electric current]] through it in the process of electrolysis, which is called the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process]], named after its American and French discoverers.\n\nPrior to the invention of this process, and prior to the [[Deville process]], aluminium ore was refined by heating ore along with elemental [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] in a [[vacuum]]. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were themselves expensive at that time. This made early elemental aluminium more expensive than [[gold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm |title=Aluminium versus aluminum | author=Michael Quinion |publisher=Worldwidewords.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Source of gallium==\nBauxite is the main source of the rare metal [[gallium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1272/pdf/ofr2013-1272.pdf |title=Compilation of Gallium Resource Data for Bauxite Deposits Author: USGS |accessdate=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring the processing of bauxite to [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] in the [[Bayer process]], gallium accumulates in the [[sodium hydroxide]] liquor.

In the 17th century AD, the [[Duke of Bavaria]] became a [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] existed from 1806 to 1918, when Bavaria became a republic. In 1946, the Free State of Bavaria re-organised itself on democratic lines after the Second World War.\n\nBavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and conservative traditions.<ref name=\"EKD2016\"/>  [[Bavarian people|Bavarians]] have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes a [[Bavarian language|language]], [[Bavarian cuisine|cuisine]], architecture, festivals such as [[Oktoberfest]] and elements of [[The Alps|Alpine]] symbolism.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bavaria \u2013 The Local|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20100204/25043|website = The Local|accessdate = 2015-08-31|first = The|last = Local}}</ref> The state also has the second largest economy among the [[List of German states by GDP|German states by GDP figures]], giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Eric|title=Germany \u2013 A Bavarian Fairy Tale|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2012/s3430858.htm|website=ABC|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of [[Franconia]] and [[Swabia]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Bavaria}}\n[[File:Heunischenburg.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric ''[[Heunischenburg]]'', in the vicinity of [[Kronach]]]]\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe Bavarians emerged in a region north of the [[Alps]], previously inhabited by [[Celts]], which had been part of the Roman provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Bavarians spoke [[Old High German]], but, unlike other Germanic groups, they probably did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by the Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic [[Boii]], some remaining [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Allemanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Thuringians]], [[Goths]], [[Scirians]], [[Rugians]], [[Heruli]]. The name \"Bavarian\" (\"[[Baiuvarii]]\") means \"Men of Baia\" which may indicate Bohemia, the homeland of the Celtic [[Boii]] and later of the Marcomanni. They first appear in written sources circa 520. A 17th century Jewish chronicler [[David Gans|David Solomon Ganz]], citing [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]], claimed that the diocese was named after an ancient Bohemian king, Boiia, in the 14th century BC.<ref name=ganz>Dovid Solomon Ganz, Tzemach Dovid (3rd edition), part 2, Warsaw 1878, pp. 71, 85 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite= available online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071027/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite= |date=14 April 2016 }} )</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Further information|Duchy of Bavaria}}\nFrom about 554 to 788, the house of [[Agilolfing]] ruled the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], ending with [[Tassilo III]] who was deposed by [[Charlemagne]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Warren|title=Unjust Seizure|date=2001|isbn=9780801437908|page=63 |edition=1st |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Unjust_Seizure.html?id=2Gxcm3kbgQAC|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThree early dukes are named in [[Franks|Frankish]] sources: [[Garibald I]] may have been appointed to the office by the [[Merovingian]] kings and married the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King [[Chlothar I]] in 555. Their daughter, [[Theodelinde]], became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, [[Tassilo I of Bavaria|Tassilo I]], tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] around 600. Tassilo's son [[Garibald II of Bavaria|Garibald II]] seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Unknown|first1=Unknown|title=History of Bavaria|url=http://www.guide-to-bavaria.com/en/Bavaria-History.html|website=Guide to Bavaria|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter Garibald II little is known of the Bavarians until [[Theodo of Bavaria#Ordinals|Duke Theodo I]], whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onwards he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy (it is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time). His son, [[Theodbert of Bavaria|Theudebert]], led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the [[Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|King Liutprand]]. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson [[Hugbert of Bavaria|Hugbert]].\n\nAt Hugbert's death (735) the duchy passed to a distant relative named [[Odilo of Bavaria|Odilo]], from neighbouring Alemannia (modern southwest Germany and northern Switzerland). Odilo issued a [[Lex Baiuvariorum|law code for Bavaria]], completed the process of church organisation in partnership with [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface]] (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Grifo]]. He was defeated near [[Augsburg]] in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frassetto|first1=Michael|title=The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne [2 Volumes]|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598849967|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6feKDfRM9sYC&dq=grifo+defeated+743&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Early Medieval Europe, 300\u20131000|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137014283|page=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZukcBQAAQBAJ&dq=odilo+bavaria+ruled+748&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> [[Saint Boniface]] completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century. \n[[File:Karte Herzogtum Bayern im 10.

He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onwards. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the [[River Danube]] and colonising these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of [[Regensburg]] in 792, led by his own son [[Pepin the Hunchback|P\u00e9pin the Hunchback]]. The king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.\n[[File:Baiern unter den Carolingern im Jahre 900.jpg|thumb|Kingdom of Bavaria 900]]\n\n[[File:Bayern nach der Teilung 1392.png|thumb|Bavarian duchies after the partition of 1392]]\nFor the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]] in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. The territory of ''Ostarrichi'' was elevated to a duchy in its own right and given to the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberger family]]. This event marks the founding of Austria.\n\nThe last, and one of the most important, of the dukes of Bavaria was [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[house of Welf]], founder of Munich, and ''de facto'' the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of [[Saxony]] and Bavaria by his cousin, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (a.k.a. \"Barbarossa\" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as [[fief]] to the [[Wittelsbach]] family, counts palatinate of Schyren (\"Scheyern\" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. The [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] by Rhine (''Kurpfalz'' in German) was also acquired by the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Joel F.|title=Reordering Marriage and Society in Reformation Germany|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521464833|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFeGzFxsBzMC&dq=electorate+of+the+palatinate+1214&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>\n\nThe first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] in 1268, [[Swabia]]n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] acquired [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] for his House but released the [[Upper Palatinate]] for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: [[Bavaria-Straubing]], [[Bavaria-Landshut]], [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]] and [[Bavaria-Munich]].  In 1506 with the [[Landshut War of Succession]], the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital.\n\n===Electorate of Bavaria===\n{{Further information|Electorate of Bavaria}}\nIn 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in the early days of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and acquired the powerful [[prince-elector]]al dignity in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws. The country became one of the Jesuit-supported counter-reformation centers. During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria ([[War of the Spanish Succession]], election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburger). From 1777 onwards and after the younger Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Max III Joseph]], Bavaria and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] were governed once again in [[personal union]], now by the Palatinian lines. The new state also comprised the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|Duchies of J\u00fclich]] and [[Berg (state)|Berg]] as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.\n\n===Kingdom of Bavaria===\n{{Main article|Kingdom of Bavaria}}\n[[File:Bayern von 1800 bis heute.png|thumb|Bavaria in the 19th century and beyond]]\nWhen [[Napoleon]] abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a [[Kingdom of Bavaria|kingdom]] in 1806 due, in part, to the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=Paul R.|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0810878921|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOJdBgAAQBAJ&dq=bavaria+kingdom+1806+napoleon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> Its area doubled after the Duchy of J\u00fclich was ceded to France, as the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].

In return Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] to the west of the [[Rhine]] and [[Franconia]] in 1815.  Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count [[Maximilian Joseph von Montgelas|Montgelas]], followed a strict policy of modernisation; he laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived the monarchy and retain core validity in the 21st century. In May 1808 a first constitution was passed by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=James J.|title=German History, 1770\u20131866|date=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0198204329|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAEj4vtFR3AC&dq=1808+constitution+bavaria&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords (''Kammer der Reichsr\u00e4te'') and a House of Commons (''Kammer der Abgeordneten'').

Allied to Austria, it was defeated in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] and did not belong to the [[North German Federation]] of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When [[Franco-Prussian War|France declared war on Prussia in 1870]], the south German states Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria joined the Prussian forces (whereas Austria did not) and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed [[German Empire|''Deutsches Reich'' (German Empire)]] in 1871. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it had some special rights within the federation (such as an army, railways, postal service and a diplomatic body of its own).\n\n===Part of the German Empire===\nWhen Bavaria became part of the newly formed German Empire, this action was considered controversial by [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] who had wanted to retain independence, as Austria had. As Bavaria had a majority-Catholic population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly [[Protestant]] northerners of [[Prussia]]. As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence.<ref name=\"Minahan2000\">{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&pg=PA106|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30984-7|pages=106\u2013}}</ref> Although the idea of Bavarian separatism was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, apart from a small minority such as the [[Bavaria Party]], most Bavarians have accepted that Bavaria is part of Germany. {{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the [[Schwabing]] district of Munich, a center of international artistic activity.

They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by Franz's presence or absence.\n\nEisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the [[Freikorps]], the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The [[Constitution of Bavaria|Bamberg Constitution]] (''{{lang|de|Bamberger Verfassung}}'') was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the Weimar Republic. Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] led by the [[NSDAP|National Socialists]], and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as [[Nazism|Nazi]] strongholds under the [[Third Reich]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. However, in the crucial [[German federal election, March 1933]], the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.\n\nAs a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] and was occupied by U.S. troops, becoming a major part of the American Zone of [[Allied-occupied Germany]] (1945\u201347) and then of [[Bizone|\"Bizonia\"]].\n\nThe Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. During the [[Cold War]], Bavaria was part of [[West Germany]]. In 1949, the Free State of Bavaria chose not to sign the Founding Treaty (''Gr\u00fcndungsvertrag'') for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany, opposing the division of Germany into two states, after [[World War II]]. The [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian Parliament]] did not sign the [[Basic Law of Germany]], mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual ''L\u00e4nder'', but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other ''L\u00e4nder'' ratified it. All of the other ''L\u00e4nder'' ratified it, and so it became law.\n\n===Bavarian identity===\nBavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as \"Bavarians\" first, \"Germans\" second.<ref>[http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html Bavaria Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204020156/http://www.european-vacation-planner.com/bavaria-guide.html |date=4 February 2013 }}.

This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.\n* The \"[[Franconian Rake]]\": At the sinister chief, per [[fess]] dancetty, gules and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.\n* The Blue \"Pantier\" (mythical creature from [[French heraldry]], sporting a flame instead of a tongue): At the dexter base, argent, a Pantier rampant azure, armed Or and langued gules. This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria.\n* The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia.\n* The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.\n* The People's Crown (''Volkskrone''): The coat of arms is surmounted by a [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of [[common people|the people]] after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:\u00dcber dem Spitzsteinhaus (3650068382).jpg|thumb|left|Bavarian Alps]]\nBavaria shares international borders with [[Austria]] ([[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Upper Austria]] and [[Vorarlberg]]) and the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Karlovy Vary Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Plze\u0148 Region|Plze\u0148]] and [[South Bohemian Region]]s), as well as with [[Switzerland]] (across [[Lake Constance]] to the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]). Because all of these countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]], the border is completely open. Neighbouring states within Germany are [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], Hesse, [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]]. Two major rivers flow through the state: the [[Danube]] (''Donau'') and the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The [[Bavarian Alps]] define the border with Austria (including the Austrian federal-states of Vorarlberg, Tyrol and Salzburg), and within the range is the highest peak in Germany: the [[Zugspitze]]. The [[Bavarian Forest]] and the [[Bohemian Forest]] form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.\n\nThe major cities in Bavaria are [[Munich]] (''M\u00fcnchen''), [[Nuremberg]] (''N\u00fcrnberg''), [[Augsburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Ingolstadt]], [[F\u00fcrth]], and [[Erlangen]].\n\nThe [[Geographical midpoint of Europe#Geographic centre of the European Union|geographic centre of the European Union]] is located in the north-western corner of Bavaria.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:WV-Bavaria regions.svg|thumb|Administrative districts (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') of Bavaria]]\nBavaria is divided into 7 administrative districts called ''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' (singular ''{{lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]}}'').\n\n===Administrative districts===\n*'''[[Altbayern]]''':\n# [[Upper Palatinate]] (''{{lang-de|Oberpfalz}}'')\n# [[Upper Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Oberbayern}}'')\n# [[Lower Bavaria]] (''{{lang|de|Niederbayern}}'')\n*'''[[Franconia]]''':\n# [[Upper Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Oberfranken}}'')\n# [[Middle Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Mittelfranken}}'')\n# [[Lower Franconia]] (''{{lang|de|Unterfranken}}'')\n*'''[[Swabia]]''':\n# [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia]] (''{{lang|de|Schwaben}}'')\n\n====Population and area====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n! | Administrative region\n! | Capital\n! colspan=\"2\" | Population (2011)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Area (km<sup>2</sup>)\n! colspan=\"2\" | No. municipalities\n|-\n| [[Lower Bavaria]]\n| Landshut\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,192,641\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 9.48%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10,330\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.6%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 258\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 12.5%\n|-\n| [[Lower Franconia]]\n| W\u00fcrzburg\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,315,882\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10.46%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8,531\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 12.1%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 308\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 15.0%\n|-\n| [[Upper Franconia]]\n| Bayreuth\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,067,988\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8.49%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,231\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10.2%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 214\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10.4%\n|-\n| [[Middle Franconia]]\n| Ansbach\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,717,670\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 13.65%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7,245\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10.3%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 210\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 10.2%\n|-\n| [[Upper Palatinate]]\n| Regensburg\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,081,800\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8.60%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 9,691\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 13.7%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 226\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11.0%\n|-\n| [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia]]\n| Augsburg\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,788,729\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.21%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 9,992\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 14.2%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 340\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16.5%\n|-\n| [[Upper Bavaria]]\n| Munich\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4,418,828\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 35.12%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17,530\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 24.8%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 500\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 24.3%\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

The Greens who had surged in the polls leading up to the election have replaced the social-democratic SPD as the second biggest force in the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] with 17.5% of the vote. The SPD lost over half of its previous share compared to 2013 with a mere 9.7% in 2018. The center-right Free Voters party has gained 11.6% of the vote and is likely to form a coalition with the CSU. The liberals of the FDP were again able to reach the 5%-threshold in order to receive mandates in parliament after they were not part of the ''Landtag'' after the 2013 elections. Also entering the new parliament will be the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 10.2% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2018-10-14-LT-DE-BY/index.shtml|title=tagesschau.de|last=tagesschau.de|website=wahl.tagesschau.de|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.\n\nBavaria has a [[unicameral]] ''{{lang|de|[[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]]}}'' (English: State Parliament), elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a ''{{lang|de|Senat}}'', or [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]], whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.\n\nThe Bavarian State Government consists of the [[Minister-President of Bavaria]], 11 Ministers and 6 Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:\n\n* Ministry of the Interior, Building and Transport (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium des Innern, f\u00fcr Bau und Verkehr}}'')\n* Ministry of Education and Culture, Science and Art (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst}}'')\n* Ministry of Finance, for Rural Development and Homeland (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Finanzen, f\u00fcr Landesentwicklung und Heimat}}'')\n* Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Medien, Energie und Technologie}}'')\n* Ministry of Environment and Consumer Protection (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz}}'')\n* Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Family and Integration (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit und Soziales, Familie und Integration}}'')\n* Ministry of Justice (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium der Justiz}}'')\n* Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten}}'')\n* Ministry of Public Health and Care Services (''{{lang|de|Staatsministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Pflege}}'')\n\nPolitical processes also take place in the 7 regions (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bezirke}}'') in Bavaria, in the 71 administrative districts (''{{lang|de|Landkreise}}'') and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts (''{{lang|de|kreisfreie St\u00e4dte}}''), and in the 2,031 local authorities (''{{lang|de|Gemeinden}}'').\n\nIn 1995 Bavaria introduced [[direct democracy]] on the local level in a [[referendum]]. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called ''Mehr Demokratie'' (English: More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court aggravated the regulations considerably (including by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs\u2014835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.\n\n====Minister-presidents of Bavaria since 1945====\n:''See also: [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria]].''\n[[File:7857ri-Markus Soeder.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Current Minister-President of Bavaria [[Markus S\u00f6der]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  style=\"background:#eef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"6\"| Ministers-President of Bavaria\n|- style=\"background:#eef;\"\n!

The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between \"States\" and \"Free States\". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where some states use the style \"Commonwealth\" rather than \"State\". The choice of \"Free State\", a creation of the early 20th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived \"republic\", has historical reasons, Bavaria having been styled that way even before the current 1946 Constitution was enacted (in 1918 after the ''de facto'' abdication of Ludwig III). Two other states, [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]], also use the style \"Free State\"; unlike Bavaria, however, these were not part of the original states when the [[Grundgesetz]] was enacted but joined the federation later on, in 1990, as a result of [[German reunification]]. Saxony had used the designation as \"Free State\" from 1918 to 1952.\n\n=== Arbitrary arrest and human rights ===\n\nIn July 2017, Bavaria's parliament enacted a new revision of the \"Gef\u00e4hrdergesetz\", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when he or she has not committed a crime but it is assumed that he or she might commit a crime \"in the near future\".<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/bayern-gefaehrder-gesetz-verschaerft-1.3595274 Gef\u00e4hrder-Gesetz versch\u00e4rft], [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]], 19 July 2017</ref> Critics like the prominent journalist [[Heribert Prantl]] have called the law \"shameful\" and compared it to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]],<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/gefaehrder-gesetz-bayern-fuehrt-die-unendlichkeitshaft-ein-1.3594307 Bayern f\u00fchrt Unendlichkeitshaft ein], Heribert Prantl, 20 July 2017</ref> assessed it to be in violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],<ref>[https://www.lawblog.de/index.php/archives/2017/07/20/bayern-endloshaft-fuer-nicht-straftaeter/ Reisewarnung f\u00fcr Bayern], Udo Vetter, 20 July 2017</ref> and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years (i.e., not indefinitely)<ref>[https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a78e46ba Erinnert ihr euch noch daran, als Bayern als Rechtsstaat galt?], [[Felix von Leitner]], 20 July 2017</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:BMW Welt y Torre BMW, M\u00fanich, Alemania, 2015-07-03, DD 25-27 HDR.JPG|thumb|right|[[BMW Welt]] and [[BMW Headquarters]] in Munich]]\nBavaria has long had one of the largest economies of any region in Germany, or Europe for that matter.<ref>Its GDP is 143% of the EU average ({{As of|2005|lc=y}}) against a German average of 121.5%, see [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&language=en&root=/theme1/reg/reg_e2gdp Eurostat]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Its GDP in 2007 exceeded \u20ac434 billion (about U.S. $600 billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/Statistik-Portal/de_jb27_jahrtab65.asp|title=Gemeinsames Datenangebot der Statistischen \u00c4mter des Bundes und der L\u00e4nder|author=Statistisches Landesamt Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|work=baden-wuerttemberg.de}}</ref> This makes Bavaria itself one of the largest economies in Europe and only 20 countries in the world have a higher GDP.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|list of countries by GDP]].</ref> Some large companies headquartered in Bavaria include [[BMW]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Rohde & Schwarz]], [[Audi]], [[Munich Re]], [[Allianz]], [[Infineon]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Wacker Chemie]], [[Puma SE|Puma]], [[Adidas]], and [[Ruf Automobile|Ruf]].

Otherwise, the culturally [[Franconia]]n and [[Swabia]]n regions of the modern State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both Catholic and [[Protestant]] traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 28.8% was [[Protestant]], 0.7% was [[Jewish]], and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik.

Traditional costumes collectively known as [[Tracht]] are worn on special occasions and include in [[Altbayern]] [[Lederhosen]] for males and [[Dirndl]] for females. Centuries-old [[folk music]] is performed. The [[Maypole tradition in Bavaria|Maibaum]], or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's [[yellow pages]], as figurettes on the pole represent the trades of the village), and the bagpipes in the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the [[Paganism in the Eastern Alps|ancient Celtic and Germanic]] remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are a lot of traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the [[Aperschnalzen]] is an old tradition of competitive [[whipcracking]].\n\nWhether actually in Bavaria, overseas or full of citizens from other nations they continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their traditions alive. In New York City the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others such as the Bavarian organizations, which represent a specific part of Germany. They proudly put forth a German Parade called [[Steuben Parade]] each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.\n\n===Food and drink===\nBavarians tend to place a great value on [[Bavarian cuisine|food and drink]]. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example {{lang|de|[[Wei\u00dfwurst]]}} (\"white sausage\") or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many [[beer garden]]s, beer is traditionally served by the litre (in a {{lang|de|[[Ma\u00df]]}}). Bavarians are particularly proud{{cn|date=June 2018}} of the traditional {{lang|de|[[Reinheitsgebot]]}}, or beer purity law, initially established by the [[Duke of Bavaria]] for the City of Munich (i.e. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, [[barley]], and [[hops]]. In 1906 the {{lang|de|Reinheitsgebot}} made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down recently as incompatible with the European common market. German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|title=To Bier or not to Bier? vom 22.10.2015: Das Reinheitsgebot und seine T\u00fccken \u2013 BR Mediathek VIDEO|author=Bayerischer Rundfunk|work=br.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027012032/http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/quer/151022-quer-reinheitsgebot-100.html|archivedate=27 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 litres per person, although figures have been declining in recent years.\n\nBavaria is also home to the [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia wine region]], which is situated along the [[Main River]] in Franconia. The region has produced wine (''Frankenwein'') for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the [[Bocksbeutel]] wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.\n\n===Language and dialects===\n[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Upper German, southern counterpart to Central German, both forming the High German Languages. Blue are the [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] dialects]]\n\nMainly three German dialects are spoken in Bavaria: [[Austro-Bavarian]] in Old Bavaria (Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate), [[Swabian German]] (an [[Alemannic German]] dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (South West) and [[East Franconian German]] in Franconia (North). In the small town [[Ludwigsstadt]] in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, [[Thuringian dialect]] is spoken. In the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak [[Standard German]], mainly in the cities.\n\n===Ethnography===\nBavarians consider themselves to be [[egalitarian]] and informal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Their sociability can be experienced at the annual [[Oktoberfest]], the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous [[beer garden]]s. In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hirschgarten.de/biergarten-muenchen-koeniglicher-hirschgarten-der-groesste-der-biergaerten-in-muenchen.html|title=Ein paar Worte zu unserem Biergarten in M\u00fcnchen ...

[[Potsdam]] is the state capital and largest city, while other major cities include [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], [[Cottbus]], and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. Brandenburg surrounds the national capital and city-state of [[Berlin]], which together form the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Germany.  Brandenburg borders the states of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Saxony]], and an international border with [[Poland]].\n\nBrandenburg originated in the [[Northern March]] in the 900s AD from areas conquered from the [[Wends]], and later became the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], a major principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with [[Albert the Bear]] as [[prince-elector]]. In the 17th century Brandenburg came under the rule of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the rulers of [[Prussia]], who established [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] to become the core of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]] in 1815, a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] within the kingdom and later within the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Brandenburg was established as a state in 1945 after [[World War II]] by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet army administration]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany]], and became part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] in 1947. Brandenburg was dissolved in 1952 during [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|administrative reforms]] and its territory divided into the districts of [[Bezirk Potsdam|Potsdam]], [[Bezirk Cottbus|Cottbus]], [[Bezirk Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], [[Bezirk Neubrandenburg|Neubrandenburg]], and [[Bezirk Schwerin|Schwerin]], but was re-established in 1990 following [[German reunification]], and became one of the Federal Republic of Germany's [[New states of Germany|new states]].\n\n==History==\n{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}\n{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}\n\nIn late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was one of seven [[prince-elector|electoral states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, along with Prussia, formed the original core of the [[German Empire]], the first unified German state. Governed by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] from 1415, it contained the future German capital Berlin. After 1618 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] were combined to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], which was ruled by the same branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In 1701 the state was elevated as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Franconian [[Nuremberg]] and [[Ansbach]], Swabian [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as [[prince-elector]] together were instrumental in the rise of that state.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Northern March}}\nBrandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as [[Magna Germania]], which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples]] are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the [[Huns]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the [[Hevelli]] in the west and the [[Sprevane]] in the east.\n\nBeginning in the early 10th century, [[Henry the Fowler]] and his successors conquered territory up to the [[Oder River]]. Slavic settlements such as Brenna<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barford|first=Paul M.|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=2001|pages=421|isbn=0-8014-3977-9}}</ref> ([[Brandenburg an der Havel]]), Budusin<ref>{{Cite book|last=Institut f\u00fcr Sorbische Volksforschung in Bautzen|title=L\u011btopis Instituta za serbski ludospyt|publisher=Domowina|location=Bautzen|year=1962|isbn=}}</ref> ([[Bautzen]]), and Cho\u015bebuz<ref>{{Cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson|year=2006|pages=433|isbn=0-7864-2248-3}}</ref> ([[Cottbus]]) came under [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern [[marches]]. In 948 Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]]. The [[Northern March]] was founded as a northeastern border territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, a great uprising of [[Wends]] drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}\n\nDuring the 12th century, the German kings and emperors re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]] adapted to [[Germanization]] while retaining their distinctiveness. The Roman Catholic Church brought [[bishoprics]] which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg an der Havel]], which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began.\n\n[[File:Burg eisenhardt torhaus und burgfried.JPG|thumb|left|Eisenhardt Castle in [[Bad Belzig]]]]\n\nIn 1134, in the wake of a German [[Northern Crusade|crusade]] against the [[Wends]], the German magnate, [[Albert the Bear]], was granted the [[Northern March]] by the Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Albert, and his descendants the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century, the Ascanians began acquiring territory east of the Oder, later known as the [[Neumark]] (see also [[Altmark]]).\n\nIn 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]], followed by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] Dynasties. Under the Luxembourgs, the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] gained the status of a [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period 1373-1415, Brandenburg was a part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which would rule until the end of World War I. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.\n\n===16th and 17th centuries===\n{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}\n[[File:Schlacht bei Fehrbellin2.JPG|thumb|Brandenburg's victory over Swedish forces at the [[Battle of Fehrbellin]] in 1675]]\nBrandenburg converted to Protestantism in 1539 in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the Elbe, Havel, and Spree Rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by co-rulership since 1577 and acquiring the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (1614) in the [[Rhineland]], and territories in [[Westphalia]]. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] that was in poor shape to defend itself during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nBeginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the so-called \"Great Elector\", who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to [[Potsdam]]. At the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], his envoy [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]] negotiated the acquisition of several important territories such as [[Halberstadt]]. Under the [[Treaty of Oliva]] Christoph Caspar [[von Blumenthal]](son of the above) negotiated the incorporation of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] into the Hohenzollern inheritance.\n\n===Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia|Province of Brandenburg}}\n[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci Palace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sanssouci Palace]] in Potsdam, the former summer palace of [[Frederick the Great]], today a [[World Heritage site]]]]\n[[File:Brandenburg superimposed on modern borders.svg|thumb|200px|[[Province of Brandenburg]] superimposed on modern borders.]]\nWhen Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of \"[[King in Prussia]]\" (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].\n\nBrandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]], again subdivided into the [[Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt|government regions of Frankfurt]] and [[Potsdam]]. In 1881, the City of Berlin was separated from the Province of Brandenburg. However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of {{convert|39039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 2.6 million (1925). After World War II, the [[Neumark]], the part of Brandenburg east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], was transferred to [[Poland]]; and its native German population expelled. The remainder of the province became a state in the [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany]] when Prussia was dissolved in 1947.\n\n===East Germany ===\n[[File:Glienicker Br\u00fccke1.JPG|thumb|[[Glienicke Bridge]], which connected East Germany to the American sector of West Berlin, became known for the exchange of captured spies.]]\nSince the foundation of [[East Germany]] in 1949 Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|Socialist government of East Germany]], doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several ''Bezirke'' or districts. (See [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic]]). Most of Brandenburg lay within the [[Cottbus (Bezirk)|Bezirke of Cottbus]], [[Frankfurt (Bezirk)|Frankfurt]], or [[Potsdam (Bezirk)|Potsdam]], but parts of the former province passed to the [[Schwerin (Bezirk)|Schwerin]], [[Neubrandenburg (Bezirk)|Neubrandenburg]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg districts]] (town [[Havelberg]]). East Germany relied heavily on [[lignite]] (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.\n\n===Federal Republic of Germany===\n[[File:LandtagSchuschkeSeptember2012.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of Potsdam's historic center, 2012.]]\nThe present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 3 October 1990 upon [[German reunification]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm|title=L\u00e4ndereinf\u00fchrungsgesetz (1990)|publisher=}}</ref> The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411062741/http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |archivedate=11 April 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread unemployment and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and unemployment has slowly declined.\n\nIn 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of \"Berlin-Brandenburg\", though some suggested calling the proposed new state \"Prussia\". The merger was rejected in a [[plebiscite]] in 1996 \u2013 while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|List of places in Brandenburg}}\nBrandenburg is bordered by [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the north, [[Poland]] in the east, the [[Free State of Saxony|Freistaat Sachsen]] in the south, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the west, and [[Lower Saxony]] in the northwest.\n\nThe [[Oder River]] forms a part of the eastern border, the [[Elbe|Elbe River]] a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the [[Spree]] and the [[Havel]]. In the southeast, there is a wetlands region called the [[Spreewald]]; it is the northernmost part of [[Lusatia]], where the [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people, still live.

[[Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble]] is the current [[President of the Bundestag]]. Members of the Bundestag (''Mitglieder des Bundestages'') are usually elected every four years by all adult German citizens in a mixed system of constituency voting and list voting. The constitutional minimum number of seats is 598; with [[overhang seat|overhang]] and [[leveling seat]]s there are currently 709 seats. The Election Day can be called earlier than four years after the last if the Federal [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] (''Bundeskanzler'') loses a [[motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] and asks the Federal [[President of Germany|President]] (''Bundespr\u00e4sident'') to dissolve the Bundestag in order to hold new general elections.\n\nIn the 19th century the name Bundestag was the unofficial designation for the assembly of the sovereigns and mayors of the Monarchies and Free Cities which formed the [[German Confederation]] (1815\u20131866). Its seat was in the [[Free City of Frankfurt]] on the Main.\n\n==History==\nWith the dissolution of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 and the founding of the [[German Empire]] ([[Deutsches Reich]]) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin, which was the capital of the then [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (the largest and most influential state in both the Confederation and the empire). Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the [[Prussian three-class franchise|three-class electoral system]] prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Revolution of November 1918]] and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the [[Reichstag fire]], the then President of the German Reich, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a retired war hero, gave [[Adolf Hitler]] ultimate power through the [[Reichstag Fire Decree|Decree for the Protection of People and State]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], although Hitler remained at the post of Federal Government Chancellor (though he called himself the F\u00fchrer). After this the Reichstag met only rarely, usually at the [[Kroll Opera House#1933-1951: Seat of the Reichstag and destruction|''Krolloper'']] (Kroll Opera House) following the Reichstag fire starting in 1933 to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.\n\nWith the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|new Constitution of 1949]], the Bundestag was established as the new West German parliament. Because [[West Berlin]] was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution, a legacy of the [[Cold War]], the Bundestag met in [[Bonn]] in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former water works facility. In addition, owing to the city's legal status, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 22 non-voting delegates<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F54jJBcrs50C&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=bundestag+west+berlin+22&source=bl&ots=fHvcgFedJi&sig=TOHuagAFxKdwr04qEslLTYLQzyM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQxITa37PKAhUC1hQKHddqCikQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&q=bundestag%20west%20berlin%2022&f=true ''Germany at the Polls: The Bundestag Elections of the 1980s''], Karl H.

The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn and in the north areas the branch office of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (\"Federal Council\", upper house of the German Federal Parliament representing the ''L\u00e4nder'' \u2013 the federated states). The southern areas became part of German offices for the [[United Nations]] in 2008.\n\nThe former [[Reichstag building]] housed a history exhibition (''Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte'') and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundesversammlung]] (Federal Assembly), the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.\n\nSince April 19, 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in [[Berlin]] in its original [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]], which was built in 1888 based on the plans of German architect Paul Wallot and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and parliamentary group meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the ''Jakob-Kaiser-Haus'', ''Paul-L\u00f6be-Haus'' and ''Marie-Elisabeth-L\u00fcders-Haus''.\n\nIn 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German Parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.\n\n==Tasks==\n[[File:Berlin_reichstag_west_panorama_2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reichstag building]]]]\n[[File:Berlin reichstag CP.jpg|thumb|left|The ''German Unity Flag'' is a national memorial to [[German Reunification]] that was raised on 3 October 1990; it waves in front of the [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin, seat of the Bundestag]]\nTogether with the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the Bundestag is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Politics of Germany|German political system]].\n\nAlthough most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.\n\nThe Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour ''(Fragestunde),'' in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.\n\nConstituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of [[internet petition]]s, a version of [[e-Petitioner]] was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[International Teledemocracy Centre]] and the Bundestag \u2018Online Services Department\u2019. The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316102923/http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 March 2009 |title=''\u00d6ffentliche Petitionen beim deutschen Bundestag - erste Ergebnisse der Evaluation des Modellversuchs'' = An Evaluation Study of Public Petitions at the German Parliament'' |accessdate=16 June 2009 |last=Trenel |first=M. |work=TAB Brief Nr 32 |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Electoral term ==\nThe Bundestag is elected for four years, and new elections must be held between 46 and 48 months after the beginning of its electoral term.

The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, if the recommendation is made and accepted before the Bundestag acts to elect a new Chancellor. This has happened three times: 1972 under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], 1983 under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and 2005 under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. The procedures for these situations are governed by Articles 67 and 68 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Law regarding the election procedure itself is the Federal Election Act 1956 (Bundeswahlgesetz/BWahlG)<ref>{{cite web|title=Text des Bundeswahlgesetz (BWahlG)|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwahlg/|website=gesetz-im-internet.de|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP electoral system]]. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a [[political party|party]] to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation. Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution.\n\nThe most recent election, the [[German federal election, 2017]], was held on 24 September 2017.\n\n===Distribution of seats in the Bundestag===\n{{See also|List of German Bundestag constituencies}}\n[[File:Bundestagswahl 05 stimmzett.jpg|thumb|right|Bundestag ballot: constituency vote on left, party list (showing top five list candidates) vote on right]]\nHalf of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies ([[first-past-the-post system]]), the other half are elected from the parties\u2019 Land lists in such a way as to achieve [[proportional representation]] for the total Bundestag (if possible).\n\nAccordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.\n\nThe second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.\n\nAt least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way. Parties that gain more than 5% of the second votes or win at least 3 direct mandates are allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received ([[d'Hondt method]] until 1987, [[largest remainder method]] until the 2005 election, now [[Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method]]).\n\nIn addition to this, there are certain circumstances in which some candidates win what are known as [[overhang seat]]s when the seats are being distributed. If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote, it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag. The other parties are then compensated by getting additional seats as well, the ''balance seats'', so proportionality is preserved.\n\n==Election result==\n\nThe last Federal elections were held on Sunday, 24 September 2017, to elect the members of the 19th Bundestag.\n\nThe election saw the CDU/CSU win 33% of the vote, a drop of more than 8% and its lowest share of the vote since [[West German federal election, 1949|1949]], while the SPD achieved its worst result since the [[World War II|Second World War]] with just 20% of the vote. [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD)\u2014which was previously unrepresented in the Bundestag\u2014became the third party in the Bundestag with 12.6% of the vote and a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote in [[Saxony]]. No party won an outright majority in any state, including Bavaria, where the CSU often wins majorities and won a majority of the vote in 2013.\n\n{| class=wikitable

''Fraktion''), which are traditionally formed by political parties represented in the chamber which incorporate more than 5% of the Bundestag legislators; [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] have always formed a single united ''Fraktion''. The size of a party's ''Fraktion'' determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The ''Fraktionen,'' not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.\n\nThe leadership of each ''Fraktion'' consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the ''Fraktion,'' enforce party discipline, and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each ''Fraktion'' are distributed among [[working group]]s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The ''Fraktion'' meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.\n\nParties which do not fulfill the criterion for being a ''Fraktion'' but have at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a certain electoral district) in the Bundestag can be granted the status of a ''group'' of the Bundestag. This applied to the [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a ''Fraktion''. In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party\u2014now [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]\u2014has now returned to the Bundestag with full ''Fraktion'' status).\n\n===Executive bodies===\nThe Bundestag's executive bodies include the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]] and the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Presidium]]. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each ''fraktion'', with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest ''fraktion'') and vice presidents (one from each ''fraktion'').\n\n===Committees===\nMost of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period. The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). There are, as of the current eighteenth Bundestag, 23 standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the current eighteenth Bundestag, the [[CDU/CSU]] chaired twelve committees, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] seven, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) two, and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen), two. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees (e.g. The budget committee is always chaired by the biggest opposition party). These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.\n\n==Principle of discontinuation==\nAs is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the ''principle of discontinuation'', meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result, that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as void by non-decision (German terminology: \"''Die Sache f\u00e4llt der Diskontinuit\u00e4t anheim''\"). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must be brought up by the government again, if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (''Gesch\u00e4ftsordnung''), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding ''Bundestag'' by reference.\n\nAny Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article&nbsp;39 sec.&nbsp;1 sentence&nbsp;2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article&nbsp;39 sec.&nbsp;2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself.

BMW's facilities in [[East Germany]] were seized by the Soviet Union and the remaining facilities were banned by the Allies from producing motorcycles or automobiles. During this ban, BMW used basic secondhand and salvaged equipment to make pots and pans, later expanding to other kitchen supplies and bicycles.\n\nIn 1947, BMW was granted permission to resume motorcycle production and its first post-war motorcycle - the [[History of BMW motorcycles#1945\u20131955|R24]] - was released in 1948. BMW was still barred from producing automobiles, however, the Bristol Aeroplane Company (BAC) was producing cars in England based on BMW's pre-war models, using plans that BAC had taken from BMW's German offices.\n\nProduction of automobiles resumed in 1952, with the [[BMW 501]] large sedan. Throughout the 1950s, BMW expanded their model range with sedans, coupes, convertibles and sports cars. In 1954, the [[BMW 502]] was BMW's first to use a V8 engine. To provide an affordable model, BMW began production of the [[Isetta]] micro-car (under license from [[Iso (automobile)|Iso]]) in 1955. Two years later, the four-seat [[BMW 600]] was based on a lengthened version of the Isetta design. In 1959, the BMW 600 was replaced by the larger [[BMW 700]] coupe/sedan.\n\n=== 1959\u20131968: Near bankruptcy and New Class ===\n[[File:BMW1500FrontSeit.JPG|thumb|New Class sedan]]\nBy 1959, BMW was in debt and losing money.<ref name=\"Norbye134\">[[#Norbye|Norbye]], p. 134</ref> The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins.<ref name=\"Noakes57\">[[#Noakes|Noakes]], p. 57</ref> Their 501-based luxury sedans were not selling well enough to be profitable and were becoming increasingly outdated.<ref name=\"Norbye130\">[[#Norbye|Norbye]], p. 130</ref> Their 503 coup\u00e9 and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable.<ref name=\"Norbye130\" /> Their [[BMW 600|600]], a four-seater based on the Isetta, was selling poorly.<ref name=\"Noakes56_67\">[[#Noakes|Noakes]], pp. 56&ndash;57</ref> The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increasing affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars.<ref name=last>[[#Norbye|Norbye]], pp. 119&ndash;120</ref> BMW had sold their Allach plant to [[MAN SE|MAN]] in 1954.<ref name=\"Norbye119\">[[#Norbye|Norbye]], p. 119</ref> [[American Motors]] and the [[Rootes Group]] had both tried to acquire BMW.<ref name=\"Norbye132\">[[#Norbye|Norbye]], p. 132</ref>\n\nAt BMW's [[annual general meeting]] on 9 December 1959, Dr. Hans Feith, chairman of BMW's [[supervisory board]], proposed a merger with [[Daimler-Benz]]. The dealers and small shareholders opposed this suggestion and rallied around a counter-proposal by Dr. Friedrich Mathern, which gained enough support to stop the merger.<ref name=\"Noakes57\" /><ref name=\"Norbye132\" /> At that time, the Quandt Group, led by half-brothers [[Herbert Quandt|Herbert]] and [[Harald Quandt]], had recently increased their holdings in BMW and had become their largest shareholder.<ref name=\" Norbye132\"/>  In 1960, the development program began for a new range of models, called the \"Neue Klasse\" (New Class) project. The resulting [[BMW New Class|New Class]] four-door sedans, introduced in 1962, are credited for saving the company financially and establishing BMW's identity as a producer of leading sports sedans.\n\nIn 1965, the New Class range was expanded with the [[BMW New Class#New Class Coup\u00e9s|2000 C and 2000 CS]] luxury coupes. The range was further expanded in 1966 with the iconic [[BMW 02 Series]] compact coupes.\n\nBMW acquired the [[Hans Glas]] company based in [[Dingolfing]], Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,<ref>Toronto Star 3 July 2004</ref> although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.<ref name=\"AU71\">{{citation | ref = AU71 | journal = Auto-Universum 1971 | title = BMW 2500/2800 | last = Becker | first = Clauspeter | editor-first = Arthur | editor-last = Logoz | year = 1971 | publisher = Verlag Internationale Automobil-Parade AG | location = Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland | volume = XIV | page = 73 | language = German }}</ref> The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.<ref name=\"AU71.4\">[[#AU71|Becker]], p. 74</ref>\n\n=== 1968\u20131978: New Six, 3 Series, 5 Series, 7 Series ===\n[[File:BMW 30 CSL 1973 orange vr TCE.jpg|thumb|[[BMW E9|E9]] 3.0 CSL]]\nIn 1968, BMW began production of its first [[straight-six engine]] since World War II. This engine coincided with the launch of the [[BMW New Six|New Six]] large sedans (the predecessor to the [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]]) and [[BMW E9|New Six CS]] large coupes (the predecessor to the [[BMW 6 Series|6 Series]]).\n\nThe first [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series]] range of mid-size sedans were introduced in 1972, to replace the New Class sedans. The 5 Series platform was also used for the [[BMW 6 Series (E24)|6 Series]] coupes, which were introduced in 1976. In 1975, the first model of the [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]] range of compact sedans/coupes was introduced. The [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]] large sedans were introduced in 1978.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== 1978\u20131989: M division ===\n[[File:Black BMW M3 E30 fr.jpg|thumb|E30 M3]]\nThe 1978 [[BMW M1]] was BMW's first mid-engined sports car and was developed in conjunction with [[Lamborghini]]. It was also the first road car produced by BMW's motorsport division, [[BMW M]]. In 1980, the M division produced its first model based on a regular production vehicle, the [[BMW E12|E12]] M535i. The M535i is the predecessor to the [[BMW M5]], which was introduced in 1985 based on the [[BMW 5 Series (E28)|E28]] platform.\n\nIn 1983, BMW introduced its first diesel engine, the [[BMW M21|M21]]. The first all-wheel-drive BMW - the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] 325iX - began production in 1985, and in 1987 the E30 was BMW's first model produced in a [[station wagon|wagon/estate]] body style.\n\nThe 1986 [[BMW 7 Series (E32)|E32]] 750i was BMW's first V12 model. The E32 was also the first sedan to be available with a long-wheelbase body style (badged \"iL\" or \"Li\").\n\nThe [[BMW M3]] was introduced in 1985, based on the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] platform.\n\n=== 1989\u20131994: 8 Series, hatchbacks ===\n[[File:BMW 840 Ci 1.jpg|thumb|E31 8 Series]]\nThe [[BMW 8 Series|8 Series]] range of large coupes was introduced in 1989 and in 1992 was the first application of BMW's first V8 engine in 25 years, the [[BMW M60|M60]]. It was also the first BMW to use a multi-link rear suspension, a design which was implemented for mass-production in 1990 [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|E36]] 3 Series.\n\nThe [[BMW 5 Series (E34)|E34]] 5 Series, introduced in 1988, was the first 5 Series to be produced with all-wheel drive or a wagon body style.\n\nIn 1989, the limited-production [[BMW Z1|Z1]] began BMW's line of two-seat convertible [[BMW Z Series|Z Series]] models.\n\nIn 1993, the [[BMW 3 Series Compact]] was BMW's first [[hatchback]] model (except for the limited production 02 Series \"Touring\" models). These hatchback models formed a new entry-level model range below the other 3 Series models.\n\nIn 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based [[industrial design]] studio [[DesignworksUSA]], which they fully acquired in 1995.\n\nThe 1993 [[McLaren F1]] is powered by a BMW V12 engine.\n\n=== 1994\u20131999: Rover ownership, Z3 ===\n[[File:BMW Z3 3.0i 2001 - Flickr - The Car Spy (9) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Z3 roadster]]\nIn 1994, BMW bought the British [[Rover Group]]<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KdbY5QkQ64cC |title=Corporate Cultures And Global Brands |author=Albrecht Rothacher |year=2004 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-238-856-8 |page=239}}</ref> (which at the time consisted of the [[Rover (car)|Rover]], [[Land Rover]], [[Mini]] and [[MG (car)|MG]] brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]]), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell off several of the brands. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form [[MG Rover]], while Land Rover was taken over by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new [[BMW Mini|Mini]], which was launched in 2001.\n\nIn 1995, the [[BMW 7 Series (E38)|E38]] 725tds was the first 7 Series to use a diesel engine. The [[BMW 5 Series (E39)|E39]] 5 Series was also introduced in 1995 and was the first 5 Series to use rack-and-pinion steering and a significant number of suspension parts made from lightweight aluminum.\n\nThe [[BMW Z3]] two-seat convertible and coupe models were introduced in 1995. These were the first mass-produced models outside of the 1/3/5 Series and the first model to be solely manufactured outside Germany (in the United States, in this case).\n\nIn 1998, the [[BMW 3 Series (E46)|E46]] 3 Series was introduced, with the M3 model featuring BMW's most powerful naturally aspirated engine to date.\n\n=== 1999\u20132006: SUV models, Rolls-Royce ===\n[[File:2003-2006 BMW X5 (E53) 3.0d 01.jpg|thumb|E53 X5]]\nBMW's first SUV, the [[BMW X5 (E53)]], was introduced in 1999. The X5 was a large departure from BMW's image of sporting \"driver's cars\", however, it was very successful and resulted in other [[BMW X Series]] being introduced. The smaller [[BMW X3]] was released in 2003.\n\n2001 [[BMW 7 Series (E65)|E65]] 7 Series was BMW's first model to use a 6-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIn 2002, the [[BMW Z4 (E85)|Z4]] two-seat coupe/convertible replaced the Z3. In 2004, the [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]] hatchbacks replaced the ''3 Series Compact'' models like BMW's entry-level models.\n\n2003 [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]] was the first Rolls-Royce vehicle produced under BMW ownership. This was the end result of complicated contractual negotiations that began in 1998 when [[Rolls-Royce plc]] licensed use of the Rolls-Royce name and logo to BMW, but Vickers sold the remaining elements of [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars]] to Volkswagen. In addition, BMW had supplied Rolls-Royce with engines since 1998 for use in the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph]].\n\nIn 2005, BMW's first V10 engine was introduced in the [[BMW 5 Series (E60)|E60]] M5. The E60 platform is also used for the [[BMW 6 Series (E63)|E63/E64]], which reintroduced the 6 Series models after a hiatus of 14 years.\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Shift to turbocharged engines ===\n[[File:BMW ActiveHybrid 7 L (F02) \u2013 Frontansicht, 26.

In 2011, the [[BMW 3 Series (F30)|F30]] 3 Series was released, with turbocharged engines being used on all models. This shift to turbocharging and smaller engines was reflective of general automotive industry trends. The M3 model based on the F30 platform is the first M3 to use a turbocharged engine.\n\nBMW's first turbocharged V8 engine, the [[BMW N63]], was introduced in 2008. Despite the trend to downsizing, in 2008 BMW began production of its first turbocharged V12 engine, the [[BMW N74]]. In 2011, the [[BMW 5 Series (F10)|F10]] M5 became the first M5 model to use a turbocharged engine.\n\nIn 2007, the production rights for [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros.\n\nThe [[BMW X6]] SUV was introduced in 2008. The X6 attracted controversy for its unusual combination of coupe and SUV styling cues.\n\nIn 2009, the [[BMW X1]] compact SUV was introduced. The [[BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo]] fastback body style was also introduced in 2009, based on the 5 Series platform.\n\nControversial designer [[Chris Bangle]] announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2009/02/bmws_chris_bangle_designs_his_own_exit.html|title=Chris Bangle|accessdate=24 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418144031/http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2009/02/bmws_chris_bangle_designs_his_own_exit.html|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBMW's first hybrid-powered car, the [[BMW 7 Series (F01)|F01]] ActiveHybrid 7, was introduced in 2010.\n\n=== 2013\u2013present: Electric/hybrid power ===\n[[File:2015 BMW i8 (I12) coupe (25835062172).jpg|thumb|i8]]\nBMW released their first electric car, the [[BMW i3]] city car, in 2013. The i3 is also the first mass-production car to have a structure mostly made from [[carbon-fiber]]. BMW's first hybrid sportscar (and their first mid-engined car since the M1) is called the [[BMW i8]] and was introduced in 2014. The i8 is also the first car to use BMW's first inline-three engine, the [[BMW B38]].\n\nIn 2013, the [[BMW 4 Series]] replaced the coupe and convertible models of the 3 Series. Many elements of the 4 Series remained shared with the equivalent 3 Series model. Similarly, the [[BMW 2 Series]] replaced the coupe and convertible models of the 1 Series in 2013. The 2 Series was produced in coupe (F22), five-seat MPV (F45) and seven-seat MPV (F46) body styles. The latter two body styles are the first front-wheel drive vehicles produced by BMW. The [[BMW X1 (F48)|F48 X1]] also includes some front-wheel-drive models.\n\nThe [[BMW X4]] compact SUV was introduced in 2014.\n\nThe 2016 [[BMW 7 Series (G11)|G11]] 740e and [[BMW 3 Series (F30)|F30/F31]] 330e are the first plug-in hybrid versions of the 7 Series and 3 Series respectively.\n\n=== Management ===\nMembers of the board of management are:\n\n* [[Harald Kr\u00fcger]], chairman\n* Milagros Cai\u00f1a Carreiro-Andree, human resources\n* Klaus Fr\u00f6hlich, development\n* Pieter Nota, sales and brand\n* Nicolas Peter, finance\n* Peter Schwarzenbauer, [[Mini (marque)|Mini]], [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]], [[BMW Motorrad]]\n* Andreas Wendt, purchasing and supplier network\n*[[Oliver Zipse]], production\n\n<small>(as of 29 October 2018)</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/company/company-portrait.html|title=BMW Group - Company - Company Portrait|website=www.bmwgroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\n== Company name and logo ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2 = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\nThe name '''BMW''' is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259|-|GT BMW-AG.ogg}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a [[sidecar]] attached. Having a unique design copied from the [[Z\u00fcndapp]] KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the [[Willys MB|Jeep]].\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\n== Automobiles ==\n{{Main|List of BMW vehicles}}\n{{See also|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW automobiles are:\n\nThe '''1 Series''' ([[BMW 1 Series (F20)|F20/F21]]) is the entry level to BMW's current model range.

{{lang-non|Burgundaholmr}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Baltic Sea]], to the east of the rest of [[Denmark]], south of [[Sweden]], northeast of [[Germany]] and north of the westernmost part of [[Poland]]. Occupying an area of {{convert|588.36|km2|sqmi}},<ref>[http://www.noegletal.dk Economy and Interior Ministry: Municipal Key Figures]</ref> the island had a total population on 1 January 2018 of 39,632.\n\nAmong Bornholm's chief industrial activities are [[dairy farming]] and arts-and-crafts industries such as [[glass production]] and [[pottery]] using locally worked [[clay]]. [[Tourism]] is also important during the summer months. The island is home to an especially large number of Denmark's [[Nordic round churches|round churches]]. \n\nThe island is known as ''solskins\u00f8en'' (''Sunshine Island'') because of its weather and ''klippe\u00f8en'' (''Rock Island'') because of its geology, which consists of [[granite]], except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As a result of the climate, a local variety of the [[common fig]], known as ''Bornholm's Diamond'', can grow locally on the island.  The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of [[Denmark]], which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and [[deciduous]] forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.<ref>{{cite book| last = Blecher| first = Lone Thygesen|author2=George Blecher| title = Swedish Folktales & Legends| date = August 2004| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4575-6| pages = xvi }}</ref>\n\nStrategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. Usually it had been ruled by Denmark, but also by [[L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck, Germany]] and [[Sweden]]. The ruin of [[Hammershus]], at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest [[castle#History|medieval fortress]] in [[northern Europe]], testament to the importance of its location. This island and [[Ertholmene]] is what remains in Denmark of [[Sk\u00e5neland]] east of [[\u00d8resund]], having been surrendered to Sweden in [[Treaty of Roskilde|1658]] but with Bornholm regained by a local revolt in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].\n\n==Language==\n{{Main article|Bornholmsk dialect}}\n\nMany inhabitants speak the [[Bornholmsk dialect]], which is officially a [[Danish language#Dialects|dialect of Danish]].<ref>Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff. (Danish)</ref> Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical gender]]s, like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its [[phonology]] includes [[archaism]]s (unstressed {{IPA|[a]}} and internal {{IPA|[d\u0325, \u0261\u030a]}}, where other dialects have {{IPA|[\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[\u00f0\u031e, \u028a / \u026a]}}) and innovations ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u029d]}} for {{IPA|[k\u02b0, \u0261\u030a]}} before and after front-tongue vowels). This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish.

It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality|Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nex\u00f8]], [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]] whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm ''Regional'' Municipality. The island had 21 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 15 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in ''all'' of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, R\u00f8nne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The question on the [[ballot]] was, \"Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?\" 73.9% voted in favour. The lowest percentage for the merger was in [[Nex\u00f8]] municipality, whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more \"Yes\" votes than \"No\" votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 ([[Danish local elections, 2017|election November 2017]]). The merger was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. The first regional mayor in the first three years from 2003 until 2005 was Thomas Thors (born 28 July 1949), a physician and member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and previously the last mayor of R\u00f8nne Municipality for five years from 1998 until 2002. Bjarne Kristiansen, who was the last mayor of [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]] 2\u00bd years from the summer of 2000 until 2002, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor for four years from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2007, Bornholm became a part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]]. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosb\u00f8ll, a high school teacher and a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokratiet'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].\n\nFerry services connect R\u00f8nne to [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[K\u00f8ge]], {{convert|45|km|abbr=off}} by road ({{convert|34|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}} as the crow flies) south of Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]; the destination to K\u00f8ge replaced the nighttime route directly to and from Copenhagen (for both cargo and passengers) from 1 October 2004; and [[HSC Leonora Christina|catamaran]] services to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nex\u00f8]] and the Polish ports of [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[\u0141eba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.\n\nBecause of its remote location Bornholm Regional Municipality has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], and is its own employment region, and also performs other tasks normally carried out by the regions in the rest of Denmark.

P. Mallory|Mallory, J.P.]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams|D.Q. Adams]]. ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]''.

It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg, Bornholm|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.\n\nBornholm was pawned to [[L\u00fcbeck]] for 50 years starting in 1525. Its first militia, [[Bornholms Milits]], was formed in 1624.\n[[File:Bornholm-arsdale-windmill.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|An 1877<ref name=Museum>[http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/sekundaer-menu/forside.aspx Bornholm Museum]</ref> windmill at [[Aarsdale|\u00c5rsdale]]]]\n\nSwedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] along with the rest of the [[Sk\u00e5neland]], [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], and it was occupied by Swedish forces.\n\nA revolt broke out the same year, culminating in Villum Clausen's shooting of the Swedish commander [[Johan Printzensk\u00f6ld]] on 8 December 1658.<ref name=Museum/> Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660.\n\n[[Swedes]], notably from [[Sm\u00e5land]] and Scania, emigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain.\n[[File:R\u00f8nne.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[R\u00f8nne]], Bornholm.]]\n\nBornholm also attracted many famous artists at the beginning of the 20th century, forming a group now known as the [[Bornholm school of painters]]. In addition to [[Oluf H\u00f8st]], they include [[Karl Isaksson]] (1878\u20131922), from Sweden, and the Danes [[Edvard Weie]] (1879\u20131943), [[Olaf Rude]] (1886\u20131957), [[Niels Lergaard]] (1893\u20131982), and [[Kr\u00e6sten Iversen]] (1886\u20131955).<ref>[http://www.visitdenmark.com/en-us/bornholm/art/bornholms-culture-and-heritage \"Bornholm's culture and heritage\"], Visit Denmark.

The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important \"natural fortress\" between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries, which had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.\n\nOn 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test \u2013 the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and [[V-2]].{{citation need|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Soviet occupation (1945\u20131946) ===\nBornholm was heavily bombarded by the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] in [[Timeline_of_World_War_II_(1945-91)#May_1945|May 1945]]. The German garrison commander, German Navy Captain [[List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Ka-Km)|Gerhard von Kamptz]] (1902\u20131998), refused to surrender to the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the western allied forces instead of the Soviets. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[R\u00f8nne]] and [[Nex\u00f8]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7\u20138 May 1945. The population had been forewarned of the bombardments, and the towns were evacuated, but 10 local people were killed, of which 1 in Nex\u00f8. Also soldiers were killed and wounded. Some of them were [[Baltic states|Baltic]] allies of Germany fighting the Soviets to remain independent.\n\nDuring the Soviet bombing of the two main towns on 7 and 8 May, Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark.<ref>En \u00d8 i krig / An island at war by B\u00f8rge Kure</ref> On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261|title=Soviet Information Bureau report |date=11 May 1945|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>) surrendered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2|title=Bornholm during World War II|accessdate=2007-09-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023108/http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Soviet forces left the island on [[Timeline_of_World_War_II_(1945-91)#April_1946|5 April 1946]].\n\n===Cold War===\nAfter the evacuation of their forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took the position that the stationing of foreign troops on Bornholm would be considered a declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression. This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, in particular of US troops.<ref>[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf Vojtech Mastny, \"NATO in the Beholder\u2019s Eye: Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949\u201356\".

This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially [[wind turbine]]s.\n\nBornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations.

Even though heat is rare, the climate is sunny during summers and rainfall is generally sparse for a climate of this type. The winter (November\u2013December) 2010 \u2013 (January\u2013April) 2011 was exceptionally extreme with snow depth reaching at least 146 [[centimeter|cm]], 2 inches short of 5 [[foot (unit)|feet]] ([[snowdrift]]s 6 [[Metre|meters]], almost 20 feet) the highest in Northern Europe. Military assistance was needed. The [[Danish Meteorological Institute|DMI]] estimated the weight of snow to be 100 [[million]] [[ton]].  2013 was a cold year, with only June, July, and August being warm.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Bornholm (1971\u20132000)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 8.9\n| Feb record high C = 9.7\n| Mar record high C = 15.1\n| Apr record high C = 26.6\n| May record high C = 27.2\n| Jun record high C = 31.7\n| Jul record high C = 31.9\n| Aug record high C = 32.0\n| Sep record high C = 27.9\n| Oct record high C = 20.2\n| Nov record high C = 15.7\n| Dec record high C = 11.0\n|year record high C = 32.0\n| Jan high C = 2.7\n| Feb high C = 2.4\n| Mar high C = 4.5\n| Apr high C = 8.9\n| May high C = 14.5\n| Jun high C = 17.9\n| Jul high C = 20.1\n| Aug high C = 20.5\n| Sep high C = 16.4\n| Oct high C = 11.9\n| Nov high C = 7.3\n| Dec high C = 4.4\n|year high C = 10.9\n| Jan mean C = 0.9\n| Feb mean C = 0.4\n| Mar mean C = 2.1\n| Apr mean C = 5.5\n| May mean C = 10.5\n| Jun mean C = 14.3\n| Jul mean C = 16.8\n| Aug mean C = 17.0\n| Sep mean C = 13.4\n| Oct mean C = 9.5\n| Nov mean C = 5.4\n| Dec mean C = 2.6\n|year mean C = 8.2\n| Jan low C = \u22121.1\n| Feb low C = \u22121.7\n| Mar low C = \u22120.4\n| Apr low C = 2.1\n| May low C = 6.6\n| Jun low C = 10.7\n| Jul low C = 13.3\n| Aug low C = 13.4\n| Sep low C = 10.5\n| Oct low C = 6.9\n| Nov low C = 3.2\n| Dec low C = 0.5\n|year low C = 5.3\n| Jan record low C = -15.7\n| Feb record low C = -17.7\n| Mar record low C = -16.1\n| Apr record low C = -7.0\n| May record low C = -3.0\n| Jun record low C = -0.2\n| Jul record low C = 4.0\n| Aug record low C = 5.4\n| Sep record low C = -0.2\n| Oct record low C = -5.7\n| Nov record low C = -10.1\n| Dec record low C = -14.1\n|year record low C = -17.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 40.2\n| Feb precipitation mm = 22.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 30.6\n| Apr precipitation mm = 30.2\n| May precipitation mm = 31.9\n| Jun precipitation mm = 44.2\n| Jul precipitation mm = 47.1\n| Aug precipitation mm = 41.4\n| Sep precipitation mm = 55.5\n| Oct precipitation mm = 50.2\n| Nov precipitation mm = 52.1\n| Dec precipitation mm = 42.4\n|year precipitation mm = 488.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 16.5\n| Feb precipitation days = 12.9\n| Mar precipitation days = 13.7\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.2\n| May precipitation days = 10.0\n| Jun precipitation days = 11.0\n| Jul precipitation days = 10.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 10.8\n| Sep precipitation days = 13.2\n| Oct precipitation days = 14.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 16.7\n| Dec precipitation days = 16.1\n|year precipitation days = 157.3\n| Jan snow days = 5.6\n| Feb snow days = 5.3\n| Mar snow days = 4.0\n| Apr snow days = 0.9\n| May snow days = 0.1\n| Jun snow days = 0.0\n| Jul snow days = 0.0\n| Aug snow days = 0.0\n| Sep snow days = 0.0\n| Oct snow days = 0.0\n| Nov snow days = 1.8\n| Dec snow days = 3.4\n|year snow days = 21.2\n| Jan sun = 35\n| Feb sun = 53\n| Mar sun = 112\n| Apr sun = 190\n| May sun = 284\n| Jun sun = 266\n| Jul sun = 276\n| Aug sun = 252\n| Sep sun = 155\n| Oct sun = 102\n| Nov sun = 46\n| Dec sun = 31\n|year sun = 1809\n|source 1 = Danish Meteorological Institute<ref name = DMI1>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dmi.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Rapporter/TR/2002/tr02-12.pdf\n| title = Danish Climatological Normals 1971\u20132000 for selected stations\n| publisher = [[Danish Meteorological Institute]]\n| accessdate = 17 November 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Sports ==\nBornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water-based sports. Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical yachts are raced in one-on-one events on the water. The [[Danish Open (yachting)|Danish Open]] event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of R\u00f8nne on the western coast of Bornholm. The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a nine-event calendar which crosses three continents during the series. Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.\n\nThere are two small stadiums: [[Nex\u00f8 Stadion]], in [[Nex\u00f8]], where [[NB Bornholm]] [[association football]] club play; and the slightly larger multi-use stadium [[R\u00f8nne Stadion Nord]] in [[R\u00f8nne]], which serves the [[Non-FIFA international football|Bornholm national football team]], multi-section club most well known for [[sport of athletics|athletics]] IK Viking, and several local football clubs. The [[DBU Bornholm]] is the local branch governing football on the island.\n\n== Religion ==\nVarious Christian denominations have become established on the island, most during the 19th century.\n* ''[[Church of Denmark|Folkekirken]]'' (State church) (1536)\n* [[Baptist church]] (1843)\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) (1850)\n* [[Methodist church]] (1895)\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1897)\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]] (ca 1150)\n\n==Cultural references==\n* The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning 1987 [[Bille August]] film ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'', an adaptation of [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]]'s four volume novel by the same name, is set and was shot on the island.\n* A considerable part of the Second World War spy thriller ''[[Hornet Flight]]'' by [[Ken Follett]] takes place on Bornholm, depicting the island under German occupation.\n* ''[[Megaheavy]]'' by Danish filmmaker [[Fenar Ahmad]] is set on Bornholm in the 1980s.

whose material signs\u2014written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media\u2014the physical object contains or houses.  \n\nAs a physical object, a book is a stack of usually rectangular [[page (paper)|pages]] (made of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], [[vellum]], or [[paper]]) oriented with one longer side (either left or right, depending on the direction in which one reads a script) tied, sewn, or otherwise fixed together and then [[bookbinding|bound]] to the flexible spine of a protective [[book cover|cover]] of heavier, relatively inflexible material so that, when the opened front cover has received a massy enough stack of sheets, the book can lie flat.<ref>IEILS, p. 41</ref>  The technical term for this physical arrangement is [[Codex|''codex'']] (in the plural, ''codices''). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the [[scroll]].   \n\nAs an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' is called a book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books.  In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.\n\nBut the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, or can be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls.  In a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for on-going entries, i.e., an account book, an appointment book, a log book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or day book, or a sketch book.  Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.   \n\nBooks may be distributed in electronic form as [[e-book]]s and other formats. In its \"Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals\" of 1 November 1985, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) stated that it was \"convinced that it is desirable that the national authorities responsible for collecting and reporting statistics relating to the production and distribution of printed publications should be guided by certain standards in the matter of definitions, classification and presentation,\" and so \"in order to improve the international comparability of statistics,\" it defined a book as \"a non-periodic publication of at least 49 pages exclusive of the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the public\" (11(a)), so that books statistics could be collected on \"(a) Government publications, i.e., publications issued by public administrations or their subsidiary bodies, except for those which are confidential or designed for internal distribution only; (b) School textbooks, books prescribed for pupils receiving education at the first and second level as defined in the revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics adopted by the General Conference; (c) University theses; (d) Offprints, i.e., reprints of a part of a book or a periodical already published, provided that they have a title and a separate pagination and that they constitute a distinct work; (e) Publications which form part of a series, but which constitute separate bibliographical units; (f) Illustrated works: (i) Collections of prints, reproductions of works of art, drawings, etc., when such collections form complete, paginated volumes and when the illustrations are accompanied by an explanatory text, however short, referring to these works or to the artists themselves; (ii) Albums, illustrated books and pamphlets written in the form of continuous narratives, with pictures illustrating certain episodes; (iii) Albums and picture-books for children; (iv) Comic books\" (9-10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13146&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals: UNESCO|website=portal.unesco.org}}</ref>  A single sheet in a codex  is a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is a [[page (paper)|page]]. \n\nAlthough in ordinary academic parlance a [[Monograph|monograph]] is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly subject, in [[library and information science]] ''monograph'' denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume [[In_Search_of_Lost_Time|''In Search of Lost Time'']]), in contrast to serial publications like a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]].

[[Clay tablet]]s were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a [[stylus]]. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in [[cuneiform]], throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and well into the [[Iron Age]]. [[Wax tablet]]s were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank.\n\nThe custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman ''pugillares'') is a possible precursor of modern bound (codex) books.<ref>Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', p. 173.</ref> The etymology of the word ''codex'' (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bischoff| first = Bernhard| others = D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00f3 Cr\u00f3inin| title = Latin palaeography antiquity and the Middle Ages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CFZgQgAACAAJ| year = 1990| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-36473-7| page = 11 }}</ref>\n\n==== Scroll ====\n{{main article|Scroll}}\n[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian papyrus showing the god [[Osiris]] and the weighing of the heart.]]\nScrolls can be made from [[papyrus]], a thick [[paper|paper-like]] material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened.

Tree bark such as [[Tilia|lime]] and other materials were also used.<ref>[[Dard Hunter]]. ''Papermaking: History and Technique of an Ancient Craft New ed.'' Dover Publications 1978, p. 12.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]] (History 5:58), the [[Phoenicians]] brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (''biblion'') and book (''biblos'') come from the Phoenician port town [[Byblos]], through which papyrus was exported to Greece.<ref>Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 144\u2013145.</ref> From Greek we also derive the word tome ({{lang-el|\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote \"a roll of papyrus\". ''Tomus'' was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as ''volumen'' (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).\n\nWhether made from papyrus, [[parchment]], or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern [[codex]] book format form took over the Roman world by [[late antiquity]], but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.\n\n==== Codex ====\n[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Chinese [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo book]] meets the modern definition of Codex]]\n{{main article|Codex}}\n[[Isidore of Seville]] (died 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): \"A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''codex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.\" Modern usage differs.\n\nA codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a \"book\": leaves of uniform size [[bookbinding|bound]] in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two [[book cover|covers]] made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from [[Martial]], in his Apophoreta <small>CLXXXIV</small> at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.<ref>The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature. Edd. Frances Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth, Ron White. Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian [[author]]s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.\n\n==== Manuscripts ====\n{{main article|Manuscript}}\n[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|Folio 14 recto of the 5th century [[Vergilius Romanus]] contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]]. Note the [[bookcase]] (''capsa''), reading stand and the text written without word spacing in [[rustic capitals]].]]\n\nThe fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century A.D. saw the decline of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used\u2014mainly in the past\u2014for writing on.\nParchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.\n\nMonasteries carried on the [[Latin literature|Latin]] writing tradition in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Cassiodorus]], in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.<ref>Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 207\u2013208.</ref> [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict of Nursia]], in his ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.<ref>[[Theodore Maynard]]. ''Saint Benedict and His Monks''. Staples Press Ltd 1956, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> The ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' (Ch. <small>XLVIII</small>), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the [[Middle Ages]] and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.\n\n[[File:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Codex Amiatinus]] anachronistically depicts the Biblical [[Ezra]] with the kind of books used in the 8th Century AD.]]\nBefore the invention and adoption of the [[printing press]], almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in [[Avignon]] and Paris library of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] held only around 2,000 volumes.<ref>Martin D. Joachim. Historical Aspects of Cataloguing and Classification. Haworth Press 2003, p. 452.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[scriptorium]]'' of the monastery was usually located over the [[chapter house]]. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:\n* '''Calligraphers''', who dealt in fine book production\n* '''Copyists''', who dealt with basic production and correspondence\n* '''Correctors''', who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced\n* '''Illuminators''', who painted illustrations\n* '''Rubricators''', who painted in the red letters\n\n[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|Burgundian author and scribe [[Jean Mi\u00e9lot]], from his ''Miracles de Notre Dame'', 15th century.]]\nThe bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the [[scribe]], who usually left blank areas for illustration and [[rubrication]]. Finally, the book was bound by the [[bookbinding|bookbinder]].<ref>Edith Diehl. ''Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique''. Dover Publications 1980, pp. 14\u201316.</ref>\n[[File:Milkau B\u00fccherschrank mit angekettetem Buch aus der Bibliothek von Cesena 109-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Desk with chained books in the [[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], [[Italy]].]]\n\nDifferent types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from [[gall]] nuts and [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron vitriol]]. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment [[Purple parchment|was colored purple]], and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, [[Codex Argenteus]]).<ref>Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nIrish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.<ref>Paul Saenger. ''Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading''. Stanford University Press 1997.</ref>\n\nThe first books used [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] ([[calfskin]]) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later [[Middle Ages]], when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a [[desk]] to prevent theft. These chained books are called ''libri catenati''.\n\nAt first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the [[Manuscript culture]] of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (''pecia''), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular [[stationery|stationers]] guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.<ref>Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\n[[Judaism]] has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the [[Torah]] scroll placed in a [[synagogue]] must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the [[synagogue]]. A [[sofer]] \"scribe\" is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.\n\n==== Middle East ====\n{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}\nPeople of various religious (Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian, Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (mid 8th century to 1258), developing advanced techniques in [[Islamic calligraphy]], [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers.<ref>W. Durant, \"The Age of Faith\", New York 1950, p. 236</ref> Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque <ref>S.E. Al-Djazairi \"The Golden Age of Islamic Civilization\", Manchester 2996, p. 200</ref> as in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], that has a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers in English and the famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location in this street.\n\nThe medieval [[Muslim world]] also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as [[Proofreading|check reading]], in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only \"authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165\u2013186 [43]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> With this check-reading system, \"an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading,\" and with two or more readings, \"more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165\u2013186 [44]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen \"accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books\".<ref>Johs.

This method originated in China, in the [[Han dynasty]] (before 220 AD), as a method of [[printing]] on [[textiles]] and later [[paper]], and was widely used throughout [[East Asia]]. The oldest dated book printed by this method is ''[[The Diamond Sutra]]'' (868 AD).The method (called ''[[Woodcut]]'' when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as [[Woodblock printing|block-books]]), as well as [[playing-cards]] and [[old master print|religious pictures]], began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.\n\n==== Movable type and incunabula ====\n[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|upright|A 15th-century [[Incunable]].

Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.\n\nEarly printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"<ref>[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], \"Printing\" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2.

Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).</ref>\n\n=== 19th century to 21st centuries===\nSteam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Monotype]] and [[linotype machine|linotype]] typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for [[freedom of the press]] have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also [[intellectual property]], [[public domain]], [[copyright]]. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an [[information explosion]]. The advent of [[electronic publishing]] and the [[internet]] means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a [[digital library]], on [[CD-ROM]], in the form of e-books or other online media. An [[on-line book]] is an e-book that is available online through the internet. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing.<ref>[http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 Bowker Reports Traditional U.S. Book Production Flat in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128205430/http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 |date=January 28, 2012 }}</ref> There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the [[public domain]] into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by [[Project Gutenberg]] combined with [[Distributed Proofreaders]]. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or \"[[print on demand]]\", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and [[vanity publishing]]) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.\n\n== Modern manufacturing ==\n{{main article|Bookbinding}}\n{{See also|Publishing}}\n\n[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bookbinding|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in [[book design]], especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers' attention first.]]\n\nThe methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more [[mechanization]], a [[book printer]] in 1900 had much in common with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. [[Printing press|Gutenberg's invention]] was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by [[letterpress]] to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are printed on [[Printing and writing paper|papers]] designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter [[caliper]] or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: [[Machine finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.\n\nToday, the majority of books are printed by [[offset lithography]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNCODAAAQBAJ&pg=PA213&dq=Today,+the+majority+of+books+are+printed+by+offset+lithography#v=onepage&q=Today,%20the%20majority%20of%20books%20are%20printed%20by%20offset%20lithography&f=false|title=The Complete Canadian Book Editor|last=Vermeer|first=Leslie|date=2016-08-31|publisher=Brush Education|isbn=9781550596779|language=en}}</ref> When a book is printed, the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The [[Book size|sizes of books]] are usually specified as \"trim size\": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.\n\n===Processes===\n\n====Layout====\nModern bound books are organized according to a particular format called the book's ''layout''.  Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes.  A basic layout will include a ''front cover'', a ''back cover'', and the book's content which is called its ''body copy'' or ''content pages''.  The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s).  The ''inside front cover'' page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.  The next section, if present, is the book's ''front matter'', which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content\u2014 such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication.  Between the body copy and the back cover goes the ''end matter'' which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter).   The ''inside back cover'' page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.  The ''back cover'' itself is the usual place for the book's [[ISBN]], and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them.  Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.<ref name=\"ShellyStarks2011\">{{cite book|author1=Gary B. Shelly|author2=Joy L.

As the production line circulates, a complete \"book\" is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A [[web press]] carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of ''signatures'' (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.\n\nA ''make-ready'' is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of [[Impression (publishing)|impression]]. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.\n\n====Binding====\nAfter the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the [[bindery]]. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders \u2013 stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing [[Automation|computerization]] of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).\n\nIf the book is a [[hardcover|hardback]] its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a [[paperback]]. Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by \"Smyth sewing\" using needles, \"McCain sewing\", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or \"notch binding\", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.\n\n===Finishing===\n[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|thumb|Book pages]]\n\"Making cases\" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8\" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the [[foil stamping]] area for adding decorations and type.\n\n==Digital printing==\nRecent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using [[toner]] rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.\n\n=== E-book ===\n{{main article|e-book}}\n[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A screen of a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-reader.]]\nIn the 2000s, due to the rise in availability of affordable handheld computing devices, the opportunity to share texts through electronic means became an appealing option for media publishers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/04/04/the-rise-of-e-reading/|title=The rise of e-reading|last=Rainie|first=Lee|last2=Zickuhr|first2=Kathryn|date=2012-04-04|website=Pew Internet Libraries|access-date=2017-02-02|last3=Purcell|first3=Kristen|last4=Madden|first4=Mary|last5=Brenner|first5=Joanna}}</ref> Thus, the \"e-book\" was made. The term e-book is a contraction of \"electronic book\"; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722033703/http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=What is an e-book|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computing device with an LED display such as a traditional [[computer]], a [[smartphone]] or a [[tablet computer]]; or by means of a portable e-ink display device known as an e-book reader, such as the [[Sony Reader]], [[Barnes & Noble Nook]], [[Kobo eReader]], or the [[Amazon Kindle]]. E-book readers attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book by using this technology, since the displays on e-book readers are much less reflective. \n\n== Design ==\n{{main article|Book design}}\n\nBook design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design \"though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied.\" Richard Hendel describes book design as \"an arcane subject\" and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means. Many different creators can contribute to book design, including [[graphic design]]ers, [[artist]]s and editors.\n\n== Sizes ==\n{{main article|Book size}}\n[[File:Codex Gigas facsimile.jpg|thumb|Real-size [[facsimile]] of [[Codex Gigas]]]]\n[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|A page from the [[world's largest book]]. Each page is three and a half feet wide, five feet tall and a little over five inches thick]]\nThe size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.\n\nThe most common book sizes are:\n* Quarto (4to): the sheet of paper is folded twice, forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11-13&nbsp;inches (ca 30&nbsp;cm) tall\n* Octavo (8vo): the most common size for current hardcover books. The sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9 \u00be\" (ca 23 cm) tall.\n* DuoDecimo (12mo): a size between 8vo and 16mo, up to 7 \u00be\" (ca 18&nbsp;cm) tall\n* Sextodecimo (16mo): the sheet is folded four times, forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6 \u00be\" (ca 15 cm) tall\n\nSizes smaller than 16mo are:\n* 24mo: up to 5 \u00be\" (ca 13&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* 32mo: up to 5\" (ca 12&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* 48mo: up to 4\" (ca 10&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* 64mo: up to 3\" (ca 8&nbsp;cm) tall.\n\nSmall books can be called ''booklets''.\n\nSizes larger than quarto are:\n* Folio: up to 15\" (ca 38&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* Elephant Folio: up to 23\" (ca 58&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* Atlas Folio: up to 25\" (ca 63&nbsp;cm) tall.\n* Double Elephant Folio: up to 50\" (ca 127&nbsp;cm) tall.\n\nThe largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is [[Codex Gigas]] 92 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 22&nbsp;cm. The [[world's largest book]] is made of stone and is in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] ([[Burma]]).\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== By content ===\n[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Novel]]s in a [[bookstore]]]]\nA common separation by content are [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books. This simple separation can be found in most [[collection (museum)|collections]], [[library|libraries]], and [[bookstore]]s.\n\n==== Fiction ====\nMany of the books published today are fiction, meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for [[entertainment]]. An increase in global [[literacy]] and [[printing|print]] technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical [[social commentary]]. Most fiction is additionally categorized by [[genre]].\n\nThe '''[[novel]]''' is the most common form of fiction book. Novels are stories that typically feature a [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[theme (literature)|themes]] and [[character (arts)|characters]]. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or [[controversy|controversial]]. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and [[publishing]] [[Market (economics)|market]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Media Business; Publishers Worry After Fiction Sales Weaken |author=Edwin Mcdowell |date=October 30, 1989 |work=New York Times | id = |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/30/business/the-media-business-publishers-worry-after-fiction-sales-weaken.html |accessdate =January 25, 2008}}</ref> A [[novella]] is a term sometimes used for fiction [[prose]] typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a [[Novella|novelette]] between 7,500 and 17,500. A [[short story]] may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.\n\n'''[[Comic book]]s''' or '''[[graphic novel]]s''' are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.\n\n==== Non-fiction ====\n[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|upright|thumb|left|A page from a [[dictionary]]]]\nIn a library, a [[reference book]] is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An [[almanac]] is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An [[encyclopedia]] is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing [[word]]s, their [[etymology]], meanings, and other information is called a [[dictionary]]. A book which is a collection of [[map]]s is an [[atlas]]. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a [[handbook]]. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an [[index (publishing)|index]], such as ''Engineering Index'', or [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.\n[[File:Atlas - book.jpg|right|thumb|An [[atlas]]]]\n\nBooks with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called [[instruction manual]]s. Other popular [[how-to]] books include [[cookbook]]s and [[home improvement]] books.\n\nStudents typically store and carry [[textbook]]s and [[schoolbooks]] for study purposes. [[Elementary school]] pupils often use [[workbook]]s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or [[homework]]. In US [[higher education]], it is common for a student to take an exam using a [[blue book exam|blue book]].\n\n[[File:Friedrich Kellner diary Oct 6, 1939 p3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A page from a [[notebook]] used as hand written [[diary]]]]\n\nThere is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. [[Notebook]]s are blank papers to be written in by the user. [[Student]]s and [[writer]]s commonly use them for taking notes. [[Scientist]]s and other researchers use [[lab notebook]]s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.\n\n[[File:MichYellowBooks.JPG|thumb|A [[telephone directory]], with business and residence listings.]]\n\n[[Address book]]s, [[phone book]]s, and [[meeting|calendar/appointment]] books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal [[Address (geography)|contact information]].\n\nBooks for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called [[logbook]]s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a [[diary]] or [[personal journal]].\n\n[[Business]]es use [[accounting]] books such as journals and [[ledger]]s to record financial data in a practice called [[bookkeeping]].\n\n==== Other types ====\nThere are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. [[photograph album|Albums]] are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of [[photograph]]s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is [[stamp album]]s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of [[postage stamps]]. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).\n\n[[Hymnal]]s are books with collections of [[music]]al [[hymn]]s that can typically be found in [[church (building)|churches]]. [[Breviary|Prayerbooks]] or [[missal]]s are books that contain written [[prayer]]s and are commonly carried by [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and other devoted followers or [[clergy]].\n\n===Decodable readers and leveled books===\nA leveled book collection is a set of books organized in levels of difficulty from the easy books appropriate for an emergent reader to longer more complex books adequate for advanced readers.  Decodable readers or books are a specialized type of leveled books that use decodable text only including controlled lists of words, sentences and stories consistent with the letters and phonics that have been taught to the emergent reader.  New sounds and letters are added to higher level decodable books, as the level of instruction progresses, allowing for higher levels of accuracy, comprehension and fluency.\n\n=== By physical format ===\n[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|[[Hardcover]] books]]\n[[File:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|[[Paperback]] books]]\n\n[[Hardcover]] books have a stiff binding. [[Paperback]] books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and [[puzzle book]]s ([[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]]).\n\n[[Publishing]] is a process for producing pre-printed books, [[magazines]], and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.\n\nPublishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as [[galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.\n\n== Libraries ==\n{{main article|Library}}\n[[File:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] was built in 135 AD and could house around 12,000 scrolls.]]\nPrivate or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in [[archive]]s) first appeared in [[classical Greece]]. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a [[library]] was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern [[public library]] lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] (for example, [[Library of Alexandria]]).<ref>Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'' (Marcel Dekker, 2003), \"Public Libraries, History\".</ref> Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.\n\nThe beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.<ref>Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library'', \"Public Libraries, History\".</ref> The growth of a [[public library]] system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a [[private library]] built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 ''Report of the Trustees'' established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.<ref>McCook, Kathleen de la Pe\u00f1a (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', 2nd ed., p. 23 New York, Neal-Schuman.</ref>\n\nThe advent of [[paperback]] books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in [[pulp magazines]]. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.\n\nIn library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as \"Crown 8vo\" to indicate the [[paper size]] from which the book is made.\n\nWhen rows of books are lined on a book holder, [[bookend]]s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.\n\n== Identification and classification ==\n[[File:ISBN.JPG|thumb|left|[[ISBN]] with [[barcode]]]]\n\nDuring the 20th century, [[librarian]]s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]]. Through a global society called the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the [[publisher]] code, and the third the title code. The last part is a [[check digit]], and can take values from 0\u20139 and X (10). The [[European Article Number|EAN]] [[Barcode]]s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for [[Bookland]], and calculating a new check digit.\n\nCommercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a [[Library catalog|catalogue]]. Codes called \"call numbers\" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a [[Library classification]] system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[NISO]] Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the [[title (publishing)|title]], or the name of the author) on book spines, and on \"shelvable\" book-like objects, such as containers for [[DVD]]s, [[video tape]]s and [[software]].\n[[File:Wien - Volkskundemuseum-Bibliothek, B\u00fccherspeicher.JPG|thumb|Books on library shelves and call numbers visible on the spines]]\n\nOne of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. Another widely known system is the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like [[online general-interest book database]]s. [[Metadata]], which means \"data about data\" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.\n\n=== Classification systems ===\n* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]] (BC)\n* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)\n* [[Colon Classification]]\n* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)\n* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]]\n* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)\n* [[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]\n* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)\n\n== Uses ==\nAside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:\n* A book can be an artistic artifact, a piece of art; this is sometimes known as an [[artists' book]].\n* A book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a [[book review]].\n* A book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion, as in a [[book discussion club|book club]].\n* A book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a [[book report]].\n* Books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to [[decorative arts|decorate]] a room, such as a [[study (room)|study]].\n\n== Book marketing ==\nOnce the book is published, it is put on the market by the distributors and the bookstores. Meanwhile, his promotion comes from various media reports. Book marketing is governed by the law in many states.\n\n=== Other forms of secondary spread ===\nIn recent years, the book had a second life in the form of reading aloud. This is called public readings of published works, with the assistance of professional readers (often known actors) and in close collaboration with writers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, leaders of the literary world and artists.\n\nMany individual or collective practices exist to increase the number of readers of a book. Among them:\n* abandonment of books in public places, coupled or not with the use of the Internet, known as the [[bookcrossing]];\n* provision of free books in third places like bars or cafes;\n* itinerant or temporary libraries;\n* free public libraries in the area.\n\n=== Evolution of the book industry ===\nThis form of the book chain has hardly changed since the eighteenth century, and has not always been this way. Thus, the author has asserted gradually with time, and the copyright dates only from the nineteenth century. For many centuries, especially before the invention of printing, each freely copied out books that passed through his hands, adding if necessary his own comments. Similarly, bookseller and publisher jobs have emerged with the invention of printing, which made the book an industrial product, requiring structures of production and marketing.\n\nThe invention of the Internet, e-readers, tablets, and projects like Wikipedia and Gutenberg, are likely to strongly change the book industry in the years to come.\n\n== Paper and conservation ==\n{{main article|Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera}}\n[[File:La fille du Cid - Upper and lower cover and spine (c151e11).jpg|thumb|Halfbound book with [[leather]] and [[marbled paper]].]]\n\nPaper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through [[History of Islam|Muslim]] territories. At first made of rags, the [[industrial revolution]] changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. Papermaking in Europe began in the 11th century, although [[vellum]] was also common there as page material up until the beginning of the 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.\n\nPaper made from [[wood pulp]] became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than [[linen]] or [[abaca]] cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].\n\nPulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used [[limestone]] rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or [[alkaline]] paper. Libraries today have to consider [[mass deacidification]] of their older collections in order to prevent decay.\n\nStability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.<ref>{{Cite journal | last =Patkus | first = Beth| publication-date = 2003 | title = Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide | publication-place = Andover| publisher =Northeast Document Conservation Center | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The [[HVAC]] system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including [[pest control]].

It is located in the southern part of the [[Pelagonia]] valley, surrounded by the [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba]], [[Nid\u017ee]] and [[Kajmak\u010dalan]] mountain ranges, {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[Med\u017eitlija-N\u00edki]] border crossing with [[Greece]]. The city stands at an important junction connecting the south of the [[Adriatic Sea]]  region with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]], and is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It has been known since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period as \"The City of The Consuls\", since many European countries had consulates in Bitola.\n\nBitola is one of the oldest cities on the territory of The Republic of Macedonia, having been founded as [[Heraclea Lyncestis]] in the middle of the 4th century BC by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. The city was the last capital of [[Ottoman Rumelia]], from 1836 to 1867. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the [[List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia by population|second-largest city]] in the country.<ref name=\"Statistical Office\">[http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf Macedonian census, language and religion]</ref> Bitola is also the seat of the [[Bitola Municipality]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bitola'' is derived from the [[Old Church Slavonic]] word {{Script|Cyrs|\u0461\u0486\u0431\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0463\u043b\u0484\u044c}} (''obit\u011b\u013a\u044c'', meaning \"monastery, cloister\") as the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix \"o-\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Room | first = Adrian | title = Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for 6,600 countries, cities, territories, natural features, and historic sites | place = Jefferson, N.C. | publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc. | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | page = 60 | isbn = 0-7864-2248-3 }}</ref> The name ''Bitola'' is mentioned in the [[Bitola inscription]], related to the old city fortress built in 1015 during the ruling of [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]] (1014\u20131015) when Bitola served as capital of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Modern Slavic variants include the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''Bitola'' (\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430), the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Bitolj'' (\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0459) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''Bitolya'' (\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044f). In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the name was Hellenized to ''Vout\u00e9lion'' (\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) or ''Vit\u00f3lia'' (\u0392\u03b9\u03c4\u03ce\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1), hence the names ''Butella'' used by [[William of Tyre]] and ''Butili'' by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]]. The [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] name is ''Bituli''.\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the city (''Monast\u00edri'', \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9), also meaning \"monastery\", is a [[calque]] of the Slavic name. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''Manast\u0131r'' ({{lang-ota|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631}}) is derived from the Greek name, as is the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name (''Manastir'').\n\n==Geography==\nBitola is located in the southwestern part of Macedonia. The [[Dragor River]] flows through the city. Bitola lies at an elevation of 615 meters above sea level, at the foot of [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]]. Its magnificent [[Pelister]] mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as [[Macedonian pine]] or [[pinus peuce]], as well as a well-known ski resort.\n\nCovering an area of {{convert|abbr=on|1798|km2|0}}. and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and cultural center. It represents an important junction that connects the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the south with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n{{Wide image|BitolaPanorama.jpg|950px|Panorama of Bitola from Krkarda\u0161.}}\n\n==Climate==\nBitola has a mild [[humid continental climate]] typical of the Pelagonija region, experiencing warm and dry summers, and cold and snowy winters.

G. L.]], (1972), ''A History of Macedonia'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 59</ref> - ''City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx'') was an important settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] hero [[Heracles]]. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered this part of Macedon in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] road which passed near the city. Several monuments from the Roman times remain in Heraclea, including a [[portico]], [[thermae]] (baths), an [[amphitheater]] and a number of [[basilica]]s. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 3,000 people.\n\nIn the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea was an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the [[Archbishopric of Sardica#Council of Sardica|Sardica Council]] of 343. A small and a great (Large) basilica, the bishop's residence, and a funeral basilica near the necropolis are some of the remains of this period. Three [[nave]]s in the Great Basilica are covered with [[mosaic]]s of very rich floral and figurative [[iconography]]; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as fine examples of the early [[Christian art]] period. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] forces, commanded by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 472 and, despite a large gift to him from the city's bishop, it was sacked again in 479. It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes and was gradually abandoned.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola became a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] from middle the 8th to early 11th centuries. The spread of Christianity was assisted by St. [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Naum of Preslav]] in the 9th and early 10th centuries. Many monasteries and churches were built in the city.\n[[File:Bitolski nadpis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Bitola inscription. The name of the city of Bitola is mentioned in the inscription for the first time. The inscription reveals the fortress was built as a haven and for the salvation of the lives of the local Bulgarians.]]\nIn the 10th century, Bitola was under the rule of the Bulgarian Tsar [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]]. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]]. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. [[John Skylitzes]]'s 11th-century chronicle mentions that Emperor [[Basil II]] burned Gavril's castles in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second [[chrysobull]] (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. During the reign of Samuil, the city was an important centre in the Bulgarian state and the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name ''Pelagonia'' was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric, and in some of them Bitola was known under the name of Heraclea due to the church tradition that turned the Heraclea Bishopric into the Pelagonian Metropolitan's Diocese. In 1015, Tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], who declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city fortress. To celebrate the occasion, a [[Bitola inscription|stone inscription]] written in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.\n\nFollowing battles with the Tsar Ivan Vladislav, Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] recaptured Monastiri in 1015. The town is mentioned as an episcopal centre in 1019 in a record by Basil II. Two important uprisings against Byzantine rule took place in the Bitola area in 1040 and 1072. After the Bulgarian state was restored in the late 12th century, Bitola was incorporated under the rule of Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]. It was conquered again by Byzantium at the end of the 13th century, but it became part of [[Serbia]] in the first half of the 14th century, after the conquests of [[Stefan Du\u0161an]].\n\nAs a military, political and cultural center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like [[Constantinople]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] and [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Caravans of various goods moved to and from Bitola.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{see also|Manastir Vilayet}}\n[[File:Bitola old.jpg|thumb|Bitola in the 19th century]]\n[[File:Udruzenje chetnika za slobodu, Bitola.jpg|thumb|left|Board of the ''Chetnik Association for Freedom'']]\n[[File:Greek School Gymnasium of Monastir Bitola.JPG|thumb|Greek school in Bitola, late 19th to early 20th century]]\n[[File:Mehmed V Reshad vo Bitola, precek.jpg|thumb|left|Reception Sultan [[Mehmed V|Mehmed V Re\u015f\u00e2d]] in the train station in Bitola, 1911]]\n[[File:Komisioni_i_Alfabetit_Monastir_1908.jpg|thumb|left|[[Congress of Manastir]]]]\n[[File:Pitomci od Voena akademija, Bitola.jpg|thumb|Turkish Military Academy (1909)]]\n[[File:Tursko uciliste vo Bitola.jpg|thumb|Turkish school]]\n[[File:Bitola 05.JPG|thumb|left|Typical neoclassical architecture from the 19th century]]\n\nFrom 1382 to 1912, Manast\u0131r (now Bitola) was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

But in the late 19th century, it again it became the second-biggest city in the wider southern Balkan region after [[Salonica]].\n\nIn 1874, Manast\u0131r became the center of [[Monastir Vilayet]] which included the sanjaks of [[Sanjak of Dibra|Debra]], [[Servia, Greece|Serfidze]], [[Sanjak of Elbasan|Elbasan]], Manast\u0131r (Bitola), [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb|G\u00f6rice]] and towns of [[Kicevo|K\u0131rcaova]], [[Prilep|Pirlepe]], [[Florina]], [[Kastoria|Kesriye]] and [[Grevena]].\n\nTraditionally a strong trading center, Bitola is also known as \"the city of the consuls\". In the final period of the Ottoman rule (1878-1912), Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the famous Turkish reformer [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]. Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations that were established at that time.\n\nThere are opposing ethnographic data from that period, but it appears that no specific ethnic or religious group could claim an absolute majority of the population. According to the [http://www.univ.trieste.it/~storia/corsi/Dogo/tabelle/popolaz-ottomana1911.jpg 1911 Ottoman census], [[Greeks]] were the largest Christian population in the vilayet.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, with 740,000 Greeks, 517,000 Bulgarians and 1,061,000 Muslims in the vilayets of Selanik (Thessaloniki) and Manast\u0131r. However, it should be noted that the basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, although many of them were [[Albanians]], and all members of the Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, although their numbers included a vast majority of [[Aromanians]] and South Albanians. The Slavs were divided between Bulgarian majority and small Serbian minority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/6/6/19669/19669.txt |last=Durham M. |first=Edith |title= Twenty Years Of Balkan Tangle |publisher=Gutenberg.org}}</ref><ref>\"Serbian propaganda in Monastir was, however, then only in its infancy, and nothing but very elementary school books were to be got.

Bitola also had significant Muslim population - 11,000 (Turks, Roma, and Albanians) as well Jewish commununity - 5,200.

Bulgaria, a [[Central Powers|Central Power]], took the city on 21 November 1915, while the Allied forces [[Monastir Offensive|recaptured it in 1916]]. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian sections, under the command of French general [[Maurice Sarrail]]. Until Bulgaria's surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was almost daily bombarded by air and battery and suffered almost total destruction.\n\n===Inter-war period===\nAT the end of World War I Bitola was restored to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and, consequently, became part in 1918 of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Bitola became one of the major cities of the [[Vardarska banovina]].\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the [[World War II]] (1941\u201345), the Germans (on 9 April 1941) and later Bulgarians (on 18 April 1941) took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia, and Bitola was freed by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola victoriously.

Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is not clear if it is the same one. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church, in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to make the walls stronger.\n\nThe tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.\nThe massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, [[pendentive]]s and the dome. During the construction of the tower, the fa\u00e7ade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.\n\n===Church of Saint Demetrius===\nThe Church of [[Saint Demetrius]] was built in 1830 with voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the [[Ottoman Empire]] had to be, but of rare beauty inside, lavishly decorated with [[chandelier]]s, a carved bishop throne and an engraved [[iconostasis]]. According to some theories, the iconostasis is a work of the [[Mijaks|Mijak]] engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modeled figures of [[Jesus]] and the apostles.\n\nOther engraved wood items include the bishop's throne made in the spirit of Mijak engravers, several [[icon frames]] and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescoes originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century, and the end of [[World War I]] to the present. The icons and frescoes were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the [[New Testament]]. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of [[late-Byzantine]] artwork and [[baroque style]]. The icon of Saint Demetrius is signed with the initials \"D. A. Z.\", showing that it was made by iconographer Dimitar Andonov the [[zograph]] in 1889. There are many other items, including the [[chalice]]s made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.\n\nThe opening scenes of the film ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' were shot in the \"St. Dimitrija\" church in Bitola, as well as some ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]'' scenes.\n\n===Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart===\n{{main|Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, Bitola}}\n\n===Heraclea Lyncestis===\n[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-mk|\u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441}}) was an important ancient settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early Middle Ages.

With its numerous cupolas that look like a fortress, with its tree-branch-like inner streets and four big metal doors it is one of the biggest covered markets in the region.\n\nIt was built in the 15th century by [[Kara Daut Pasha Uzuncarsili]], then [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]]'s [[Beylerbey]]. Although the object looks secure, many times during its existence has been robbed and set on fire, but it managed to survive. The Bezisten, from the 15th to the 19th centuries, was rebuilt, and many stores, often changing over time, were located there. Most of them were selling textile and other luxurious fabrics. At the same time the Bezisten was a treasury, where in specially made small rooms the money from the whole Rumelian Vilaet was kept, before it was transferred into the royal treasury. In the 19th century the Bezisten held a total of 84 shops. Today most of them are contemporary and they sell different types of products, but no matter what the internal transformations, the outer appearance has stayed unchanged.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque===\nThe [[Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque]] is one of the most attractive monuments of Islamic architecture in Bitola.

The present [[bezisten]] does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bezisten had eighty-six shops and four large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.\n\n===Deboj Bath===\nThe Deboj Bath is a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] bath ([[Turkish bath|hamam]]). It is not known when exactly it was constructed. At one point, it was heavily damaged, but after repairs it regained its original appearance: a beautiful fa\u00e7ade, two large domes and several minor ones.\n\n==Bitola today==\n[[File:Bitola Zoo Lions 2.JPG|thumb|The [[lion]]s in their cage at Bitola zoo]]\nBitola is the economic and industrial center of southwestern Macedonia.

Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond]], by his victory became the first English monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. His opponent, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]], making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history.\n\nRichard's reign began in 1483. At the request of his brother [[Edward IV]], Richard was acting as [[Lord Protector]] for his twelve-year-old son [[Edward V]]. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost popularity when the boy and his younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the [[Tower of London]], and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the [[English Channel]] in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of [[Market Bosworth]] in Leicestershire. [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas, Lord Stanley]], and [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.\n\nRichard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or \"battles\"). One was assigned to the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and another to the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the King's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.\n\nHenry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4KfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&dq=henry+tudor+chroniclers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWheXY0arcAhUIUa0KHeuyDCIQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=henry%20tudor%20chroniclers&f=false|title=The Revolt of Owain Glyndwr in Medieval English Chronicles|last=Marchant|first=Alicia|date=2014|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=9781903153550|language=en}}</ref> From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974 the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009 a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of [[Ambion Hill]].\n\n==Background==\n{{further information|Wars of the Roses|Princes in the Tower}}\n<!-- This section is neither for determining Richard's involvement in the Princes' death, nor his motivations behind his taking the throne or the actions in doing so.

Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old [[Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk|Anne de Mowbray]], the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne.

Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800&nbsp;French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, formed the core of Henry's army.{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}} [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]], writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component,{{sfn|Major|1892|p=393}} and this claim is accepted by some modern writers,{{sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=34\u201336}} but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their [[Garde Ecossaise|elite Scottish knights and archers]], and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like [[Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny]].{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}}{{sfn|Major|1892|p=393}}\n\nIn their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}{{sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=46\u201352}}  In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood. As Henry's army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange|Lord Strange]], if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately. Stanley replied that he had other sons. Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=219}}  Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance. The reply was evasive\u2014the Stanleys would \"naturally\" come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}\n\nWell aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than {{convert|10|ft|m}} from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=48}}\n\nThe Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=220\u2013221}}  Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group, under the command of Sir [[Robert Brackenbury]], started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men fled the field.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}} Norfolk lost one of his senior officers, [[Walter Devereux, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley|Walter Devereux]] in this early clash.<ref>C.

Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Horrox|1991|pp=319\u2013320}}; Pugh (1992). p. 49.</ref> Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle.

He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800\u20131000&nbsp;knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Gravett|1999|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Ross|1999|pp=222\u2013224}}.</ref> Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer [[William Brandon (standard-bearer)|Sir William Brandon]] in the initial charge and unhorsed burly [[John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne|John Cheyne]], Edward IV's former standard-bearer,{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=325}} with a blow to the head from his broken lance.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|pp=202, 205}}\n\nOxford had left a small reserve of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some critical time.{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=203}} The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. Meanwhile, seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move and rode to the aid of Henry. Now outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}} Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh, into which the king's horse toppled. Richard, now unhorsed, gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: \"God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one.\"{{sfn|Jones|Langley|2013|p=206}} In the fighting Richard's banner man\u2014Sir [[Percival Thirlwall]]\u2014lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed.

Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess.{{sfn|Baker|2003|pp=58\u201359}}  The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin.{{sfn|Laynesmith|2005|p=81}}  Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle,{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=59}}  Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|pp=224\u2013225}}\n\nOf his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}} Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as [[Constable of the Tower]] and admiral of England, Ireland, and [[Aquitaine]]. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford.{{sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=54\u201355}}  He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament's declaration of Margaret as ''[[femme sole]]'' effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley.{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|pp=98\u201399}}  Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.{{sfn|Elton|2003|pp=78\u201380}}\n\nLike the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; [[Lambert Simnel]] claimed to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] on 16 June 1487.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men,{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=73}} including several former supporters of Richard III.{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow.{{sfn|Pugh|1992|pp=52\u201356}}  A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\n==Legacy and historical significance==\nContemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'', written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}  The other accounts were written by foreigners\u2014Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=4, 7}}  Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}} Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}  Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable,{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}} compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}}  However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=8}}  Ross finds the poem, ''[[The Ballad of Bosworth Field]]'', a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}  Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]], the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}\n\n===Historical depictions and interpretations===\n[[File:Battle of Bosworth Field re-enactment.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An armoured and mounted man leads a small party, similarly dressed in mediaeval attire, along a road.|[[Newport, Wales|Newport]] History Society re-enacts Henry's march through Wales to Bosworth Field during the battle's quincentenary celebration.]]\nHenry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country;{{sfn|Burrow|2000|p=11}} he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a \"modern age\" with its dawn in 1485.{{sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=219}}  Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian [[Bernard Andr\u00e9]], promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|pp=28, 39}}  As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings.{{sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}  For England the [[Middle Ages]] ended in 1485, and [[English Heritage]] claims that other than [[William the Conqueror]]'s successful [[Battle of Hastings|invasion]] of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=11}}  According to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] Colin Burrow, Andr\u00e9 was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his ''Henry VII'' (1502).{{sfn|Burrow|2000|p=12}}  For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because \"the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side.\"{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}}\n\nHistorians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}}{{sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was \"the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer [[William Caxton]], who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published [[Thomas Malory]]'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal\u2014''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''\u2014seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}\n\nElton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle\u2014no-one even knows exactly where it took place\u2014demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.{{sfn|Elton|2003|p=78}}\n\nMackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years.{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=8}} Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of [[Francis Bacon]] and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about \"the fall of a tyrant\".{{sfn|Mackie|1983|p=7}}\n\n===Shakespearian dramatisation===\n[[William Shakespeare]] gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. It is the \"one big battle\"; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action,{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=92}} represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the \"unequivocal triumph of good over evil\".{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}  Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', as a \"formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader\"\u2014in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in ''Richard III''.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=79}}  Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=93}}\n\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A moustached man\u2014dressed in white stockings, puffed breeches, and a red robe\u2014props himself up with his left arm on a bed.

However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar [[Thomas More]], whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=1}}  The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama.{{sfn|Saccio|2000|p=14}} [[Margaret of Anjou]] died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in ''Henry VI''.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=48}}  Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham.{{sfn|Grene|2002|p=154}}  Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.{{sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=18}}\n\nThe fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage (''alarums'' or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more ''alarums'' after Richard's councillor, [[William Catesby]], announces that the king is \"[enacting] more wonders than a man\". Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, \"A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!\"{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five [[Political decoy|decoys]] at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention. He drew inspiration from [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]'s use of them at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|p=81}}  Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation. ''[[The True Tragedy of Richard III]]'', by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.{{sfn|Edelman|1992|pp=16\u201317}}\n\n[[File:The Battle of Bosworth Field - A Scene from the Great Drama of History.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A view from the back of a stage.

As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed.{{sfn|Davies|1990|p=75}}  Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and his \"band of brothers\".{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nThe adaptation of the setting for ''Richard III'' to a 1930s fascist England in [[Ian McKellen]]'s [[Richard III (1995 film)|1995 film]], however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, \"nobly and with dignity\".{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=28}}  By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain.{{sfn|Adams|2002|pp=28\u201329}}  Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.{{sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\n==Battlefield location==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Richard's Field\n| footer    = The memorial and its plaque\n| footer_align = left\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = King Richard's Field.jpg\n| alt1      = A clearing sparsely surrounded by trees and bushes.

Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985,{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}} a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory.{{sfn|Dunn|2000|p=2}}{{sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=\"[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=387 Visiting the Battlefield]\"}}  In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=21}} [[Landscape archaeology|Landscape archaeologist]] [[Glenn Foard]], leader of the survey,{{sfn|Williamson|2008|p=2}} said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} southwest of Ambion Hill (52\u00b034\u203241\u2033N 1\u00b026\u203202\u2033W),{{sfn|Foard|2010|p=29}} contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Wainwright|2009}}; {{harvnb|Walker|2009}}.</ref>\n\n===Historians' theories===\n\nThe [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]] (popularly referred to as \"English Heritage\") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}} As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually [[toponymy|toponymical]] in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=42}}  Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with \"Brownehethe\", \"''bellum Miravallenses''\", \"Sandeford\" and \"Dadlyngton field\".{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}  The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York,{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=17}} locates the battle \"on the field of Redemore\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=1\u20132}}  This is corroborated by a 1485\u201386 letter that mentions \"Redesmore\" as its site.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with \"Bosworth\" until 1510.{{sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}\n\nFoss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for \"Redemore\" as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from \"''Hreod Mor''\", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means \"reedy marshland\". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes \"Redemore\" was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of [[Dadlington]], and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] running east to west across the region.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield.{{sfn|Foard|2004|p=51}}  Williams dismisses the notion of \"Redmore\" as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by [[William Hutton (Birmingham historian)|William Hutton]]'s 1788 ''The Battle of Bosworth-Field'', which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the [[River Sence]].{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=22}}  Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s 1577 ''Chronicle''. Holinshed wrote, \"King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest.\"  Foss believes that Hutton mistook \"field\" to mean \"field of battle\", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To \"[pitch] his field\", as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=21}}\n\n[[File:St James the Greater, Dadlington.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Side view of a building, which has a small tower on the left side: tombstones lie in rows on plots in front.|St James the Greater, [[Dadlington]]: the dead of Bosworth Field were buried here.]]\nFoss brings further evidence for his \"Redemore\" theory by quoting [[Edward Hall]]'s 1550 ''Chronicle''. Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian [[William Burton (antiquary)|William Burton]], author of ''Description of Leicestershire'' (1622),{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}} wrote that the battle was \"fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three&nbsp;miles [5&nbsp;km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of [[Shenton]], Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]\".{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.{{sfn|Foss|1998|p=28}}\n\n===Physical site===\nEnglish Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=12\u201313}}  The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been [[Land improvement|improved]] to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Ashby Canal]] carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] crossed the area on an embankment.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}{{sfn|Gravett|1999|p=83}}  The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.{{sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}\n\n[[File:King Richard's Well.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A pyramidal stone structure stands in a small clearing surrounded by small trees and bushes.

The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometers to the southwest of Ambion Hill. [[File:Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm).jpg|thumb|Bosworth Battlefield (Fenn Lane Farm)]] \nBased on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III's army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh.<ref>[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/776.pdf Bosworth Battlefield: Conjectural terrain reconstruction with two options for the Royal army deployment], Battlefields Trust</ref><ref>[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/media/775.pdf Deployments], Battlefields Trust</ref>  Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.\n\nTudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire.<ref>Peter Hammond, ''Richard III and the Bosworth Campaign'', (Barnsley, Pen and Sword, 2013) p.64</ref> \nThe Stanleys were positioned on the south side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.\n\nNorthumberland failed to engage, possibly due to the presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what came to be known as Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.\n\nThe windmill close to which the Duke of Norfolk is said to have died (according to the ballad \"Lady Bessy\") was Dadlington windmill. This has disappeared but is known to have stood at the time of the battle, in the vicinity of Apple Orchard Farm and North Farm, Dadlington. A small cluster of significant finds was made in this area, including a gold livery badge depicting an eagle. The windmill lay between the core battlefield and Richard's camp on Ambion Hill and the rout of Norfolk's vanguard was in this direction. This also accounts for the large number of dead in Dadlington parish, leading to the setting up of the battle chantry there.\n\nHistoric England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site. There are hopes that public access to the site may be possible in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EB-23.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818145049/http://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EB-23.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Adams |first=Michael |title=Echoes of War: a Thousand Years of Military History in Popular Culture |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dDqWvwezm0YC |year=2002 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Kentucky, United States |isbn=0-8131-2240-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baker |first=John |authorlink=John Baker (legal historian) |title=The Oxford History of the Laws of England 1483\u20131558 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xc5qqYoF22IC |series=The Oxford History of the Laws of England |volume=VI |year=2003 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-825817-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Britnell |first=Richard |title=The Closing of the Middle Ages?: England, 1471\u20131529 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-16598-3 |chapter=Country Politics |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Burrow |first=Colin |editor-last=Kinney |editor-first=Arthur |title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1500\u20131600 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nkJad0EYVxIC |year=2000 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58758-1 |chapter=The Sixteenth Century |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkJad0EYVxIC&pg=PA11 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Christine |title=The Wars of the Roses: Politics and the Constitution in England, c. 1437\u20131509 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=z0A9frbkU0MC |series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks |year=2002 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-31874-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chrimes |first=Stanley |title=Henry VII |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MQlo014s8lkC |series=Yale English Monarchs |origyear=1972 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]];

|page=521}}</ref> is a medium-sized and economically important [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plants]] commonly known as the '''mustards''', the '''crucifers''', or the '''cabbage family'''. Most are [[herbaceous plants]], some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without [[stipule]]s or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).\n\nThe family contains 372 [[genus|genera]] and 4060 accepted [[species]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/A/Brassicaceae/|title=Brassicaceae|publisher=The Plant List}}</ref> The largest genera are ''[[Draba]]'' (440 species), ''[[Erysimum]]'' (261 species), ''[[Lepidium]]'' (234 species), ''[[Cardamine]]'' (233 species), and ''[[Alyssum]]'' (207 species).\n\nThe family contains the [[cruciferous vegetables]], including species such as ''[[Brassica oleracea]]'' (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards), ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), ''[[Brassica napus]]'' (rapeseed, etc.), ''[[Raphanus sativus]]'' (common radish), ''[[Armoracia rusticana]]'' (horseradish), but also a cut-flower ''[[Matthiola]]'' (stock) and the [[model organism]] ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (thale cress).\n\n''[[Pieris rapae]]'' and other butterflies of the family [[Pieridae]] are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops. ''Trichoplusia ni'' ([[cabbage looper]]) moth is also becoming increasingly problematic for crucifers due to its resistance to commonly used pest control methods.<ref>Turini TA, Daugovish O, Koike ST, Natwick ET, Ploeg A, Dara SK, Fennimore SA, Joseph S, LeStrange M, Smith R, Subbarao KV, Westerdahl BB. Revised continuously. ''UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines Cole Crops.'' UC ANR Publication 3442. Oakland, CA.</ref> Some rarer ''Pieris'' butterflies, such as ''[[Pieris virginiensis]]'', depend upon native mustards for their survival, in their native habitats. Some non-native mustards, such as garlic mustard, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'', an extremely [[invasive species]] in the [[United States]], can be toxic to their larvae.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753 regarded the Brassicaceae as a natural group, naming them \"Klass\" Tetradynamia. [[Alfred Barton Rendle]] placed the family in the order [[Bessey system#Oppositifoliae|Rhoedales]], while [[George Bentham]] and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in their system published from 1862\u20131883, assigned it to their cohort Parietales (now the class [[Violales]]). Following Bentham and Hooker, [[John Hutchinson (botanist)|John Hutchinson]] in 1948 and again in 1964 thought the Brassicaceae to stem from near the Papaveraceae. In 1994, a group of scientists including [[Walter Stephen Judd]] suggested to include the [[Capparaceae]] in the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae - as defined at that moment - were [[paraphyletic]], and it was suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the [[Cleomaceae]].<ref name=Hall>{{cite journal|title= Phylogeny of Capparaceae and Brassicaceae based on chloroplast sequence data|year= 2002|last1= Hall|first1= J.C.|last2= Sytsma|first2= K.J.|last3= Iltis|first3= H.H.|journal= [[American Journal of Botany]]|volume= 89|issue= 11|pages= 1826\u20131842|doi= 10.3732/ajb.89.11.1826|pmid= 21665611}}</ref> The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago.<ref name=SB>{{cite book|title= Genetics and Genomics of the Brassicaceae|volume= 9|series= Plant Genetics and Genomics: Crops and Models|editors= Renate Schmidt, Ian Bancroft|publisher= Springer Science & Business Media|year= 2010}}</ref> All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or [[Brassicales]]).<ref name=Hall /> The [[APG II]] system, merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognize the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including ''Cleome'' and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family [[Cleomaceae]]. The [[APG III system]] has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree.<ref name=BioDis /><ref name=Su2012>{{cite journal|last1= Su|first1= Jun-Xia|last2= Wang|first2= Wei|last3= Zhang|first3= Li-Bing|last4= Chen|first4= Zhi-Duan|title= Phylogenetic placement of two enigmatic genera, Borthwickia and Stixis, based on molecular and pollen data, and the description of a new family of Brassicales, Borthwickiaceae|journal= Taxon|date= June 2012|volume= 61|issue= 3|pages= 601\u2013611|url= http://ib.cas.cn/News/201207/W020120713414196219534.pdf}}</ref>\n{{clade|style= font-size:100%;line-height:120%\n|label1=core Brassicales\n|1={{clade\n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=family [[Resedaceae]]\n               }}\n            |2=family [[Gyrostemonaceae]]\n            }}\n         |2=family [[Pentadiplandraceae]]\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=family [[Tovariaceae]]\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=family [[Capparaceae]]\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=family [[Cleomaceae]]\n               |2=family '''Brassicaceae'''\n               }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n      |2=family [[Emblingiaceae]]\n   }}\n}}\n\n=== Relationships within the family ===\nEarly classifications depended on morphological comparison only, but because of extensive [[convergent evolution]], these do not provide a reliable [[phylogeny]].

The genus name comes from the [[Classical Latin]] word ''[[wikt:brassica#Noun 2|brassica]]'', referring to [[cabbage]] and other [[cruciferous vegetables]]. The alternative older name, [[wikt:Cruciferae|Cruciferae]], meaning \"cross-bearing\", describes the four [[petal]]s of mustard flowers, which resemble a [[cross]]. Cruciferae is one of eight plant family names, not derived from a genus name and without the suffix ''-aceae'' that are authorized alternative names.<ref>{{cite web|website= [[ICBN]]|title= Article 18.|url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n=== Genera ===\n{{main|List of Brassicaceae genera}}\n\nVersion 1 of the Plantlist website lists 349 genera.<ref>{{cite web|website= The Plantlist|title= Brassicaceae|url= http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/A/Brassicaceae/|accessdate= 2017-10-09}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nSpecies belonging to the Brassicaceae are mostly [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]], or [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant]]s, some are [[dwarf shrub]]s or [[shrub]]s, and very few [[vine]]s. Although generally terrestrial, a few species such as [[water awlwort]] live submerged in fresh water. They may have a [[taproot]] or a sometimes woody [[caudex]] that may have few or many branches, some have thin or tuberous [[rhizome]]s, or rarely develop [[Stolon|runners]]. Few species have multi-cellular glands. [[Trichome|Hairs]] consist of one cell and occur in many forms: from simple to forked, star-, tree- or T-shaped, rarely taking the form of a shield or scale. They are never topped by a gland. The [[Plant stem|stem]]s may be upright, rise up towards the tip, or lie flat, are mostly herbaceous but sometimes woody. Stems carry leaves or the stems may be leafless (in ''[[Caulanthus]]''), and some species lack stems altogether. The leaves do not have [[stipule]]s, but there may be a pair of glands at base of [[Petiole (botany)|leafstalks]] and [[Pedicel (botany)|flowerstalks]]. The leaf may be seated or have a leafstalk. The [[Leaf#Morphology (large-scale features)|leaf blade]] is usually simple, entire or [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|dissected]], rarely [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|trifoliolate]] or [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|pinnately compound]]. A leaf rosette at the base may be present or absent. The leaves along the stem are almost always [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|alternately arranged]], rarely apparently opposite.<ref name=Neotropikey>{{cite web|website= Neotropikey - Interactive key and information resources for flowering plants of the Neotropics|title= Neotropical Brassicaceae|author= Al-Shehbaz, I.A.|year= 2012|url=  http://www.kew.org/science/tropamerica/neotropikey/families/Brassicaceae.htm|accessdate= 2017-07-12}}</ref> The stomata are of the [[Stoma#anisocytic|anisocytic]] type.<ref>{{cite book|first1= C.R.|last1= Metcalfe|first2= L.|last2= Chalk|year= 1950|title= Anatomy of Dicotyledons|volume= 1: Leaves, Stem, and Wood in relation to Taxonomy, with notes on economic Uses|pages= 79\u201387|url= https://archive.org/stream/anatomyofthedico033552mbp#page/n157/mode/2up}}</ref> The [[genome size]] of Brassicaceae compared to that of other Angiosperm families is very small to small (less than 3.425 million base pairs per cell), varying from 150 Mbp in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Sphaerocardamum]]'' spp., to 2375 Mbp ''[[Bunias orientalis]]''. The number of [[homologous chromosomes|homologous chromosome sets]] varies from four (n=4) in some ''[[Physaria]]'' and ''[[Stenopetalum]]'' species, five (n=5) in other ''Physaria'' and ''Stenopetalum'' species, ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and a ''[[Mathiola]]'' species, to seventeen (n=17). About 35% of the species in which chromosomes have been counted have eight sets (n=8). Due to [[polyploidy]], some species may have up to 256 individual chromosomes, with some very high counts in the North-American species of ''Cardamine'', such as ''[[Cardamine diphylla|C. diphylla]]''. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridisation]] is not unusual in Brassicaceae, especially in ''[[Arabis]]'', ''[[Rorippa]]'', ''[[Cardamine]]'' and ''[[Boechera]]''. Hybridisation between species originating in Africa and California, and subsequent [[Speciation#Speciation via polyploidization|polyploidisation]] is surmised for ''[[Lepidium]]'' species native to Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=SB />\n\n=== Inflorescence and flower ===\n[[Image:Floral diagram Erysimum Bowles Mauve 2.jpg|thumb|left|Typical floral diagram of a Brassicaceae (''Erysimum'' \"Bowles' Mauve\")]]Flowers may be arranged in [[raceme]]s, [[panicle]]s, or [[corymb]]s, with pedicels sometimes in the axil of a bract, and few species have flowers that sit individually on flower stems that spring from the axils of rosette leaves. The orientation of the pedicels when fruits are ripe varies dependent on the species. The flowers are [[Plant reproductive morphology#Terminology|bisexual]], [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|star symmetrical]] (zygomorphic in ''[[Iberis]]'' and ''[[Teesdalia]]'') and the [[Ovary (botany)#Superior ovary|ovary positioned above the other floral parts]]. Each flower has four free or seldomly merged [[sepal]]s, the lateral two sometimes with a shallow spur, which are mostly shed after flowering, rarely persistent, may be reflexed, spreading, ascending, or erect, together forming a tube-, bell- or urn-shaped calyx. Each flower has four [[petal]]s, set alternating with the sepals, although in some species these are rudimentary or absent. They may be differentiated into a [[Petal#Shape and size|blade]] and a [[Petal#Shape and size|claw]] or not, and consistently lack basal appendages. The blade is entire or has an indent at the tip, and may sometimes be much smaller than the claws. The mostly six [[stamen]]s are set in two whorls: usually the two lateral, outer ones are shorter than the four inner stamens, but very rarely the stamens can all have the same length, and very rarely species have different numbers of stamens such as sixteen to twenty four in ''[[Megacarpaea]]'', four in ''[[Cardamine hirsuta]]'', and two in ''[[Coronopus]]''. The filaments are slender and not fused, while the anthers consist of two pollen producing cavities, and open with longitudinal slits. The pollen grains are [[tricolpate]]. The [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] carries a variable number of [[nectar]]ies, but these are always present opposite the base of the lateral stamens.<ref name=Neotropikey /><ref name=BioDis>{{cite web|website= biologydiscussion|title= Brassicaceae: Characters, Distribution and Types (With Diagram)|url= http://www.biologydiscussion.com/angiosperm/dicotyledons/brassicaceae-characters-distribution-and-types-with-diagram/47923|access-date= 12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Ovary, fruit and seed ===\nThere is one [[Gynoecium#Gynoecium position|superior]] [[Gynoecium#Pistils|pistil]] that consists of two [[carpel]]s that may either sit directly above the base of the stamens or on a [[Gynophore|stalk]]. It initially consists of only one cavity but during its further development a thin wall grows that divides the cavity, both placentas and separates the two valves (a so-called false septum). Rarely, there is only one cavity without a septum. The 2\u2013600 [[ovule]]s are usually along the side margin of the carpels, or rarely at the top. Fruits are capsules that open with two valves, usually towards the top. These are called [[silique]] if at least three times longer than wide, or silicle if the length is less than three times the width. The fruit is very variable in its other traits. There may be one persistent [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] that connects the ovary to the globular or conical [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], which is undivided or has two spreading or connivent lobes. The variously shaped seeds are usually yellow or brown in color, and arranged in one or two rows in each cavety. The [[Cotyledon|seed leaves]] are entire or have a notch at the tip. The seed does not contain [[endosperm]].<ref name=Neotropikey />\n\n=== Differences with similar families ===\nBrassicaceae have a bisymmetical corolla (left is mirrored by right, stem-side by out-side, but each quarter is not symmetrical), a septum dividing the fruit, lack [[stipule]]s and have simple (although sometimes deeply incised) leaves. The [[sister group|sister family]] [[Cleomaceae]] has [[Floral symmetry#Zygomorphic|bilateral symmetrical]] corollas (left is mirrored by right, but stem-side is different from out-side), stipules and mostly palmately divided leaves, and mostly no septum.<ref name=Neotropikey /> Capparaceae generally have a [[gynophore]], sometimes an [[androgynophore]], and a variable number of stamens.<ref name=BioDis />\n\n=== Phytochemistry ===\nAlmost all Brassicaceae have [[C3 carbon fixation]]. The only exceptions are a few ''[[Moricandia]]'' species, which have a hybrid system between C3 and [[C4 carbon fixation]], C4 fixation being more efficient in drought, high temperature and low nitrate availability.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Plant Family Brassicaceae: Contribution Towards Phytoremediation|series= Environmental Pollution|editors= Naser A.

They also contain enzymes called [[myrosinase]]s, that convert the glucosinolates into [[isothiocyanate]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s and [[nitrile]]s, which are toxic to many organisms, and so help guard against herbivory.<ref name=HAW />\n\n== Distribution ==\nBrassicaceae can be found almost on the entire land surface of the planet, but it is absent from Antarctica, and in some areas in the tropics i.e. north-eastern Brazil, the [[Congo basin]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and tropical [[Australasia]]. The area of origin of the family is possibly the [[Irano-Turanian Region]], where approximately 900 species occur in 150 different genera. About 530 of them are [[Endemism|endemics]]. Next in abundance comes the [[Mediterranean Region]] with around 630 species (290 of which are endemic) in 113 genera. The family is less prominent in the [[Saharo-Arabian Region]] - 65 genera, 180 species of which 62 endemic - and North-America (comprising the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Floristic Region]]) - 99 genera, 780 species of which 600 endemic -. South-America has 40 genera containing 340 native species, Southern Africa 15 genera with over 100 species, and Australia and New-Zealand have 19 genera with 114 species between them.<ref name=SB />\n\n== Ecology ==\nBrassicaceae are almost exclusively [[Entomophily|pollinated by insects]]. A chemical mechanism in the pollen is active in many species to avoid [[selfing]]. Two notable exceptions are exclusive [[Cleistogamy|self pollination in closed flowers]] in ''[[Cardamine chenopodifolia]]'', and wind pollination in ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''.<ref name=BioDis /> Although it can be pollinated, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'' is self-fertile. Most species reproduce sexually through seed, but ''[[Cardamine bulbifera]]'' produces [[Gemma (botany)|gemmae]] and in others, such as ''[[Cardamine pentaphyllos]]'', the coral-like roots easily break into segments, that will grow into separate plants.<ref name=BioDis /> In some species, such as in the genus ''[[Cardamine]]'', seed pods open with force and so catapult the seeds quite far. Many of these have sticky seed coats, assisting long distance dispersal by animals, and this may also explain several intercontinental dispersal events in the genus, and its near global distribution. Brassicaceae are common on [[serpentine soil|serpentine]] and [[dolomite]] rich in [[magnesium]]. Over a hundred species in the family accumulate [[heavy metals]], particularly [[zinc]] and [[nickel]], which is a record percentage.<ref name=MOBOT>{{cite web|website= MOBOT|title= Brassicales|url= http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/orders/brassicalesweb.htm#Brassicaceae|accessdate= 2017-07-18}}</ref> Several ''Alyssum'' species can accumulate nickel up to 0.3% of their dry weight, and may be useful in soil remediation or even bio-mining.<ref>{{cite journal|first1= Catherine L.|last1= Broadhurst|first2= Rufus L.|last2= Chaney|year= 2016|title= Growth and Metal Accumulation of an Alyssum murale Nickel Hyperaccumulator Ecotype Co-cropped with Alyssum montanum and Perennial Ryegrass in Serpentine Soil|journal= [[Frontiers in Plant Science]]|volume= 7|issue= 451|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00451|pmc=4824781|pmid=27092164}}</ref>\n\nBrassicaceae contain [[glucosinolate]]s as well as [[myrosinase]]s inside their cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases [[Hydrolysis|hydrolise]] the glucosinolates, leading to the synthesis of [[isothiocyanate]]s, which are [[Plant defense against herbivory|compounds toxic to most animals]], fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorption of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles.<ref name=HAW>{{cite book|first= Harry Arthur|last= Woods|year= |title= Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Insects|volume= 3|series= Ecological and Environmental Physiology Series|publisher= Oxford biological}}</ref> Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may be as high as 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. ''[[Bittercress]]'' (''Barbarea vulgaris'') also produces [[triterpenoid saponin]]s. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family [[Pieridae]]. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Winde|first1= I|last2= Wittstock|first2= U.|title= Insect herbivore counteradaptations to the plant glucosinolate-myrosinase system|year= 2011|journal= Phytochemistry|volume= 72|issue= 13|pages= 1566\u201375|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2011.01.016|pmid=21316065}}</ref>\nA moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the [[diamondback moth]] (''Plutella xylostella''). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic [[nitrile]]s. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', which is used as a wide spectrum biological [[plant protection]] against caterpillars. [[Parasitoid]] wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The [[cabbage aphid]] (''Brevicoryne brassicae'') stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.<ref name=MOBOT />\n\nSince its introduction in the 19th century, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'' has been shown to be extremely successful as an [[invasive species]] in temperate North America due, in part, to its secretion of allelopathic chemicals. These inhibit the [[germination]] of most competing plants and kill beneficial soil [[fungi]] needed by many plants, such as many tree species, to successfully see their seedlings grow to maturity. The [[monoculture]] formation of an herb layer carpet by this plant has been shown to dramatically alter forests, making them wetter, having fewer and fewer trees, and having more vines such as poison ivy, ''[[Toxicodendron radicans]]''. The overall herb layer [[biodiversity]] is also drastically reduced, particularly in terms of [[sedge]]s and [[forb]]s. Research has found that removing 80 percent of the garlic mustard [[infestation]] plants did not lead to a particularly significant recovery of that [[Biodiversity|diversity]]. Instead, it required around 100 percent removal. Given that not one of an estimated 76 [[species]] that [[prey]] on the plant has been approved for [[biological control]] in [[North America]] and the variety of mechanisms the plant has to ensure its dominance without them (e.g. high seed production, self-fertility, [[allelopathy]], spring growth that occurs before nearly all native plants, roots that break easily when pulling attempts are made, a complete lack of palatability for herbivores at all life stages, et cetera) it is unlikely that such a high level of control can be established and maintained on the whole.<ref>Eubanks, HM.D., Hoffmann, J.H., Lewis, E.E., Liu, J., Melnick, R., Michaud, J.P., Ode, P., Pell, J.K., 2017.

These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal), but Protestants do not recognize them as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]].

Books found in both the Hebrew and the Greek are accepted by all denominations, and by Jews, these are the protocanonical books. Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider [[3 Esdras]] and [[3 Maccabees]] apocryphal.\n\nMost quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Cairo Geniza]], and at [[Masada]], including a Hebrew text of Sirach (Qumran, Masada) and an Aramaic text of Tobit (Qumran); the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.\n\nThe unanimous consensus of modern (and ancient) scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}}  Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Epistle of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.\n\n* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit - 200 BC]]\n* [[Book of Judith|Judith - 150 BC]]\n* [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Additions to Esther - 140-130 BC]]\n* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon - 30 BC]]\n* [[Sirach|Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) - 132 BC]]\n* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] with the [[Letter of Jeremiah|Letter of Jeremiah - 150-50 BC]]\n* [[1 Maccabees|1 Maccabees - 110 BC]]\n* [[2 Maccabees|2 Maccabees - 110-170 BC]]\n* [[Additions to Daniel]]:<ref name=\"The Rest of Daniel\">(Prayer of Azariah)- 200-0 BC,\nBel,and Susanna are often enumerated as one book, \n\"Additions to Daniel\"</ref>\n** [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]\n** [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Story of Susanna - 200-0 BC ]]\n** [[Bel and the Dragon|Bel and the Dragon - 100 BC]]\n\n====Eastern Orthodox====\nAdditional books accepted by the Eastern Orthodox:\n* [[1 Esdras|1 Esdras/3 Esdras]]<ref>Including what is known as [[5 Ezra]] (ch. 1-2) and [[6 Ezra]] (ch. 15-16); only chapters 3-14 are denoted 4 Ezra proper in critical editions; the full book of 16 chapters is often printed as one work, \"2 Esdras\" or \"4 Esdras\", in popular editions.

The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the [[Biblical apocrypha]], a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern [[Protestant]] Bibles. Catholics, following the [[Canon of Trent]] (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)]], use the traditional name of ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', meaning \"that which is to be read.\" They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German [[Luther Bible]] included such books, as did the English [[Authorized King James Version|1611 King James Version]].<ref name=\"39articles\">The foundational [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of [[Anglicanism]], in [[:s:Thirty-Nine Articles|Article VI]], asserts that these disputed books are not (to be) used \"to establish any doctrine,\" but \"read for example of life.\" Although the Biblical apocrypha are still used in [[Anglican Liturgy]], (\"Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus es]] and [[Benedicite]], are taken from the Apocrypha.

Statistics have been kept for [[professional baseball]] since the creation of the [[National League]] and [[American League]], now part of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\nMany statistics are also available from outside Major League Baseball, from [[sports league|leagues]] such as the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] and the [[Negro League]]s, although the consistency of whether these records were kept, of the standards with respect to which they were calculated, and of their accuracy has varied.\n\n==Development of statistics==\nThe practice of keeping [[document|records]] of player achievements was started in the 19th century by [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Pete|authorlink=Pete Palmer|author2=[[Paul Adomites]] |author3=David Nemec |author4=Matthew D. Greenberger |author5=Dan Schlossberg |author6=Dick Johnson |author7=Mike Tully |title=Cooperstown: Hall of Fame Players|year=2001|publisher=Publications International|location=Lincolnwood, Illinois|isbn=0-7853-4530-2|page=21|chapter=Birth of the Game}}</ref> Based on his experience with the sport of [[cricket]], Chadwick devised the predecessors to modern-day [[statistics]] including [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]], [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, and [[Earned run|runs allowed]].\n\nTraditionally, statistics such as batting average (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (the average number of earned runs allowed by a pitcher per nine innings) have dominated attention in the statistical world of baseball. However, the recent advent of [[sabermetrics]] has created statistics drawing from a greater breadth of player performance measures and playing field variables. Sabermetrics and comparative statistics attempt to provide an improved measure of a player's performance and contributions to his team from year to year, frequently against a statistical performance average.\n\nComprehensive, historical baseball statistics were difficult for the average fan to access until 1951, when researcher [[Hy Turkin]] published ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Baseball''. In 1969, [[Macmillan Publishing]] printed its first ''[[Baseball Encyclopedia]]'', using a [[computer]] to compile statistics for the first time. Known as \"Big Mac\", the encyclopedia became the standard baseball reference until 1988, when ''[[Total Baseball]]'' was released by Warner Books using more sophisticated technology. The publication of ''Total Baseball'' led to the discovery of several \"phantom ballplayers\", such as [[Lou Proctor]], who did not belong in official record books and were removed.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor=[[Pete Palmer]] and Gary Gillette|encyclopedia=The 2005 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia|title=Introduction|edition=1st|year=2005|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=1-4027-2568-X}}</ref>\n\n==Use of statistics==\nThroughout modern baseball, a few core statistics have been traditionally referenced \u2013 [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]], [[Runs batted in|RBI]], and [[home run]]s. To this day, a player who leads the league in all of these three statistics earns the \"[[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]]\". For pitchers, [[Win (baseball)|wins]], [[Earned run average|ERA]], and [[strikeouts]] are the most often-cited statistics, and a pitcher leading his league in these statistics may also be referred to as a \"Triple Crown\" winner. General managers and [[scout (sport)|baseball scouts]] have long used the major statistics, among other factors and opinions, to understand player value. Managers, catchers and pitchers use the statistics of batters of opposing teams to develop pitching strategies and set [[baseball positioning|defensive positioning]] on the field. Managers and batters study opposing pitcher performance and motions in attempting to improve hitting. Scouts will use stats when they are looking at a player who they may end up drafting or signing them to a contract.\n\nSome [[sabermetric]] statistics have entered the mainstream baseball world that measure a batter's overall performance including [[on-base plus slugging]], commonly referred to as OPS. OPS adds the hitter's [[on-base percentage]] (number of times reached base by any means divided by total plate appearances) to his [[slugging percentage]] ([[total bases]] divided by at-bats).  Some argue that the OPS formula is flawed and that more weight should be shifted towards OBP (on-base percentage).<ref name=\"ESPN\"/> The statistic [[wOBA]] (weighted on-base average) attempts to correct for this.\n\nOPS is also useful when determining a pitcher's level of success. \"Opponent On-base Plus Slugging\" (OOPS) is becoming a popular tool to evaluate a pitcher's actual performance.  When analyzing a pitcher's statistics, some useful categories to consider include [[K/9IP]] (strikeouts per nine innings), [[Strikeout-to-walk ratio|K/BB]] (strikeouts per walk), [[Home runs per nine innings|HR/9]] (Home runs per nine innings), [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] (walks plus hits per inning pitched), and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).\n\nHowever, since 2001, more emphasis has been placed on [[Defense independent pitching statistics|Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics]], including Defense-Independent ERA (dERA), in an attempt to evaluate a pitcher's performance regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind him.\n\nAll of the above statistics may be used in certain game situations. For example, a certain hitter's ability to hit left-handed pitchers might incline a manager to increase his opportunities to face left-handed pitchers. Other hitters may have a history of success against a given pitcher (or vice versa), and the manager may use this information to create a favorable\nmatch-up. Broadcast commentators often refer to this as \"playing the percentages\".\n\n==Commonly used statistics==\nMost of these terms also apply to [[softball]]. Commonly used statistics with their [[abbreviation]]s are explained here. The explanations below are for quick reference and do not fully or completely define the statistic; for the strict definition, see the linked article for each statistic.\n\n===Batting statistics===\n* 1B \u2013 [[Single (baseball)|Single]]: hits on which the batter reaches first base safely without the contribution of a [[Error (baseball)|fielding error]].\n* 2B \u2013 [[Double (baseball)|Double]]: hits on which the batter reaches second base safely without the contribution of a [[Error (baseball)|fielding error]].\n* 3B \u2013 [[Triple (baseball)|Triple]]: hits on which the batter reaches third base safely without the contribution of a [[Error (baseball)|fielding error]].\n* AB \u2013 [[At bat]]: Plate appearances, not including bases on balls, being hit by pitch, sacrifices, interference, or obstruction.\n* AB/HR \u2013 [[At bats per home run]]: at bats divided by home runs.\n* BA \u2013 [[Batting average (baseball)|Batting average]] (also abbreviated ''AVG''): hits divided by at bats (H/AB)\n* BB \u2013 [[Base on balls]] (also called a \"walk\"): hitter not swinging at four pitches called out of the strike zone and awarded first base.\n* BABIP \u2013 [[Batting average on balls in play]]: frequency at which a batter reaches a base after putting the ball in the field of play.

An at bat is different from a [[plate appearance]]. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during his turn at bat, but a batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used to calculate certain [[baseball statistics|statistics]], including [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] and [[slugging percentage]], a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if he accumulates 502 plate appearances during the season.\n\nA batter will not receive credit for an at bat if his plate appearance ends under the following circumstances:\n* He receives a [[base on balls]] (BB).<ref>In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted bases on balls as [[hit (baseball)|hits]]. The result was high [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]s, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season.</ref>\n* He is [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] (HBP).\n* He hits a [[sacrifice fly]] or a [[sacrifice bunt]] (also known as sacrifice hit).\n* He is awarded [[Baseball field#First base|first base]] due to interference or obstruction, usually by the [[catcher]].\n* He is replaced by another hitter before his at bat is completed, in which case the plate appearance and any related statistics go to the pinch hitter (unless he is replaced with two strikes and his replacement completes a strikeout, in which case the at bat and strikeout are still charged to the first batter).\nIn addition, if the [[Inning (baseball)|inning]] ends while he is still at bat (due to the third [[out (baseball)|out]] being made by a runner [[caught stealing]], for example), no at bat or plate appearance will result. In this case, the batter will come to bat again in the next inning, though the [[count (baseball)|count]] will be reset to no balls and no strikes.\n\nRule 9.02(a)(1) of the official rules of [[Major League Baseball]] defines an at bat as: \"Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (A) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (B) is awarded first base on four called balls; (C) is hit by a pitched ball; or (D) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction[.]\"<ref name=\"MLBatbat\">{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|title=Official Baseball Rules|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Major League Baseball]]|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Baseball|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-07-07|edition=2018}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAn at bat is counted when:\n*The batter reaches first base on a [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hit]]\n*The batter reaches first base on an [[Error (baseball statistics)|error]]\n*The batter is called [[Out (baseball)|out]] for any reason other than as part of a sacrifice\n*There is a [[fielder's choice]]\n\n==Records==\n{{See also|List of Major League Baseball career at-bat leaders}}\n\n[[Pete Rose]] had 14,053 career at bats, the all-time major league and National League record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/mTGQb|title=Batting Season Finder: Spanning Multiple Seasons or entire Careers, From 1871 to 2018, (requiring AB>=10000), sorted by greatest At Bats |publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rosepe01.shtml|title=Pete Rose|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The American League record is held by Carl Yastrzemski, whose 11,988 career at bats were all in the AL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/q6QUu|title=Batting Season & Career Finder: Spanning Multiple Seasons or entire Careers, Playing in the AL, From 1871 to 2018, (requiring AB>=10000), sorted by greatest At Bats|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/yastrca01.shtml|title=Carl Yastrzemski|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe single season record is held by [[Jimmy Rollins]], who had 716 at bats in 2007; [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], [[Ichiro Suzuki]] and [[Juan Samuel]] also had more than 700 at bats in a season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/lwJQY|title=Batting Season Finder: For Single Seasons, From 1871 to 2018, (requiring AB>=700), sorted by greatest At Bats |publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n14 players share the single game record of 11 at bats in a single game, all of which were [[extra inning]] games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/xOTox|title=Batting Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, (requiring AB>=11), sorted by most recent date |publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref> In games of 9 innings or fewer, the record is 7 at bats and has occurred more than 200 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/MPsTe|title=Batting Game Finder: From 1908 to 2018, Only 9-inning games or shortened, (requiring AB>=7), sorted by most recent date |publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe team record for most at bats in a single season is 5,781 by the [[1997 Boston Red Sox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/ztosp|title=Team Batting Season Finder: For Single Seasons, from 1871 to 2018, At Bats>=5750, Standard statistics, Sorted by greatest At Bats  |publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==At bat as a phrase==\n\"At bat\", \"up\", \"up at bat\", and \"at the plate\" are all phrases describing a batter who is facing the pitcher. Note that just because a player is described as being \"at bat\" in this sense, he will not necessarily be given an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a [[plate appearance]] (assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of \"at bat\" described above, the term \"official at bat\" is sometimes used.\n\n=== \"Time at bat\" in the rulebook ===\nOfficial Baseball Rule 5.06(c) provides that \"[a] batter has legally completed his ''time at bat'' when he is put out or becomes a runner\" (emphasis added). The \"time at bat\" defined in this rule is more commonly referred to as a [[plate appearance]], and the playing rules (Rules 1 through 8) uses the phrase \"time at bat\" in this sense (e.g. Rule 5.04(a)(3), which states that \"[t]he first batter in each inning after the first inning shall be the player whose name follows that of the last player who legally completed his ''time at bat'' in the preceding inning\" (emphasis added). In contrast, the scoring rules uses the phrase \"time at bat\" to refer to the statistic '''at bat''', defined in Rule 9.02(a)(1), but sometimes uses the phrase \"official time at bat\" or refers back to Rule 9.02(a)(1) when mentioning the statistic. The phrase \"plate appearance\" is used in Rules 9.22 and 9.23 dealing with batting titles and hitting streaks, but is not defined anywhere in the rulebook.<ref name=\"MLBatbat\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Batting order (baseball)|Batting order]]\n*[[At bats with runners in scoring position]]\n\n{{Baseball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:At Bat}}\n[[Category:Baseball statistics]]\n[[Category:Batting (baseball)]]", "sha1": "sr2bl7ymca76i8i0akz1thofsj6lyae"}}, {"title": "Earned run", "ns": "0", "id": "3801", "revision": {"id": "860886664", "parentid": "851415952", "timestamp": "2018-09-23T18:47:28Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2600:1014:B00E:F16D:C1F7:900D:F6EB:E5DF"}, "comment": "/* Details */added content", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In [[baseball]], an '''earned run''' is any [[Run (baseball)|run]] that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team.  Conversely, an '''unearned run''' is a [[Run (baseball)|run]] that would not have been scored without the aid of an [[Error (baseball)|error]] or a [[passed ball]] committed by the defense.  \n\nAn unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game.  However, it is \"unearned\" in that it was, in a sense, \"given away\" by the defensive team. \n\nBoth total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's [[baseball statistics|statistics]].  However, earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's [[earned run average]] (ERA), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine [[innings pitched]] (i.e., averaged over a regulation game).  Thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team. \n\nTo determine whether a run is earned, the [[official scorer]] must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.\n\n==Details==\nIf no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher). Also, in some cases, an error can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. For example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks. Since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any effect on the earned/unearned calculation. On the other hand, a batter/runner may make his entire circuit around the bases without the aid of an error, yet the run would be counted as unearned if an error prevented the third out from being made before he crossed the plate to score.\n\nAn error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.\n\nA run is counted as unearned when:\n\n* A batter reaches base on an error (including catcher's interference) that would have retired the batter except for the error, and later scores a run in that inning by any means.\n* A batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped by a fielder for an error, extending the at bat, and later scores a run in that inning by any means. In this case, the manner in which the batter reached base becomes irrelevant.\n* A baserunner remains on base as the result of an error on a fielder's choice play that would put the baserunner out except for the error, and subsequently scores a run in that inning by any means.\n* A batter reaches first base on a [[passed ball]] (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and subsequently scores by any means.\n* A baserunner scores by any means after the third out would have been made except for an error other than catcher's interference.\n* A batter reaches base on a [[fielder's choice]] which removes a baserunner who has reached base safely on an error or has remained on base as the result of an error, reaching first base on a passed ball on a called or swinging third strike, or remained on base on an error on a fielders' choice play that should have retired him, and subsequently scores.\n* A batter or runner advances one or more bases on an error or passed ball (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and scores on a play that would otherwise not have provided the opportunity to score.\n\nWhile the inning is still being played, the second and last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain.  Under the last circumstance, for example, with two outs, a runner on [[third baseman|third base]] scores on a passed ball.  For the time being, the run is unearned since the runner ''should'' still be at third. If the batter [[strikeout|strikes out]] to end the inning, it will stay that way.  If the batter gets a [[base hit]], which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.\n\nUnder the second circumstance, if there are runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home run), the runs are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. If the results of the remaining at bats in the inning would not have scored the runners, the runs remain unearned. However, if results of subsequent at bats would have scored the runs anyway, the runs would count as earned, unless they only would have scored as a result of a subsequent error or passed ball.\n\nA runner who reaches on [[catcher's interference]] and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher's interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner  cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (Rule 10.16(4)).\n\nNeither the use of a [[pinch-runner]] to replace a baserunner who represents an unearned run nor the use of a [[pinch-hitter]] to continue the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error transforms a run scored by such a person or his successors on base from an unearned run to an earned run.\n\n===Pitching changes===\nWhen pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team.  The simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out.  A new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a [[home run]].  The runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team.  However, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs).  Had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.\n\nA pitcher who is relieved mid-inning may be charged with earned runs equal to the number of batters who reached base while he was pitching, even if the specific batters he faced do not score.  The batters he put on base may be erased by fielder's choice plays after he has been relieved by another pitcher, but if earned runs are scored in the inning the original pitcher is liable for as many earned runs as the number of batters he put on base. \nExample:\n:On April 15, 2017, [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]]'s [[Justin Verlander]] allowed the first two [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] batters in the 5th inning to reach base on base hits; Verlander was then relieved by [[Shane Greene]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2017/B04150CLE2017.htm |title=Cleveland Indians 13, Detroit Tigers 6 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=April 15, 2017}}</ref> Greene walked the next batter to load the bases. The next batter hit a grounder and [[Miguel Cabrera]] threw home to force out the runner on third in a fielder's choice, so the bases remained loaded with one out. Greene struck out the next batter for the second out. [[Carlos Santana (baseball)|Carlos Santana]] then hit a single that scored the runners from second and third (only one of whom was put on base by Verlander), and the runner from first was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.

An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher's interference, the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced; the ball is live after a walk (see below for details).\n\nA batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been \"walked\" by the pitcher. When the batter is walked, runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base. If a batter draws a walk with the [[bases loaded]], all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run; when a run is forced on a walk, the batter is credited with an [[Run batted in|RBI]] per rule 10.04.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp|title=Official Rules|author=|date=|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nReceiving a base on balls does not count as a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] or an [[at bat]] for a batter but does count as a [[times on base|time on base]] and a [[plate appearance]]. Therefore, a base on balls does not affect a player's [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], but it can increase his [[on-base percentage]].<ref>In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted bases on balls as [[Hit (baseball)|hits]].  The result was skyrocketed batting averages, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season. Current record books do not count walks in 1887 as hits.</ref>\n\nA [[hit by pitch]] is not counted statistically as a walk, though the effect is mostly the same, with the batter receiving a free pass to first base.  One exception is that on a HBP (hit-by-pitch), the ball is dead.  On a HBP, any runners attempting to steal on the play must return to their original base unless forced to the next base anyway.  When a walk occurs, the ball is still live: any runner not forced to advance may nevertheless attempt to advance at his own risk, which might occur on a [[steal (baseball)|steal]] play, [[passed ball]], or [[wild pitch]].  Also, because a ball is live when a base on balls occurs, runners on base forced to advance one base may attempt to advance beyond one base, at their own risk. The batter-runner himself may attempt to advance beyond first base, at his own risk.  Rule 6.08 addresses this matter as well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Office of the Comm'r of Baseball|title=2001 Official Rules of Major League Baseball|year=2000|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=1-57243-397-3|pages=93\u201394 (Rule 6.08)}}</ref>   An attempt to advance an additional base beyond the base awarded might occur when ball four is a [[passed ball]] or a [[wild pitch]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1880, the National League changed the rules so that eight balls instead of nine were required for a walk.  In 1884, the National League changed the rules so that six balls were required for a walk.  In 1886, the American Association changed the rules so that six balls instead of seven were required for a walk; however, the National League changed the rules so that seven balls were required for a walk instead of six.  In 1887, the National League and American Association agreed to abide by some uniform rule changes and decreased the number of balls required for a walk to five.  In 1889, the National League and the American Association decreased the number of balls required for a walk to four.<ref>{{cite book | author = | editor = | year = 2001 | title = 2001 Official Major League Baseball Fact Book | publisher = The Sporting News | location = St. Louis, Missouri | id = 0-89204-646-5 | pages = 276\u2013280}}</ref> In 2017, Major League Baseball approved a rule change allowing for a batter to be walked intentionally by having the defending bench signal to the Umpire. The move was met with some controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/23/516878572/major-league-baseball-poised-to-change-intentional-walk-rule|title=Major League Baseball Poised To Change Intentional Walk Rule|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}</ref>\n\n==Intentional base on balls==\n{{main|Intentional base on balls}}\nA subset of the base on balls, an '''intentional base on balls''' ('''IBB''') or '''intentional walk''' is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls. As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without liability to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, commonly done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a [[home run]], [[sacrifice fly]], or [[Run batted in|RBI]] [[hit (baseball)|base hit]]).  Teams also commonly use intentional walks to set up a [[double play]] or [[force play|force out]] situation for the next batter.\n\nIntentional walks do carry risks, however.  They carry an obvious, inherent risk: they give the offensive team another runner on base, without any effort on their part, who could potentially score a run.  They may carry additional risks.\n\n[[Image:Escobar IBB.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mark Hendrickson]] of the [[Florida Marlins]] intentionally walking the [[Atlanta Braves]]' [[Yunel Escobar]] in 2008. Note the Florida [[catcher]], [[Mike Rabelo]], in a standing position behind the opposite batter's box to receive the pitch]]\n\nAn intentional walk is signaled by the catcher standing and extending one arm to the side away from the batter. The pitcher then pitches the ball to that side several feet outside from home plate, usually outside the reach of the batter. A ball pitched in this manner is called an '''intentional ball''' and counts as a ball in the pitcher's [[pitch count]]. In order to count as an intentional ball, the ball must be legally pitched, i.e., the pitcher's foot must be on the [[baseball field#Pitcher's mound|pitcher's rubber]], the catcher must be in the [[baseball field#Batter's box and catcher's box|catcher's box]], and the batter must be in the [[baseball field#Batter's box and catcher's box|batter's box]] appearing ready to take a pitch at the time the ball is thrown. An intentional walk may be signaled at any time during the batter's turn at the plate; in these cases only enough additional intentional balls need to be thrown to bring the total to four. Only walks issued by the catcher signaling as described above are recorded as intentional walks (see below); walks issued without the catcher signaling \u2013 even if the pitches ''are'' intentionally thrown outside of the strike zone \u2013 are not recorded as intentional.\n\nAnother risk taken by the defensive team in issuing a base on balls is that since intentional balls must be pitched in a legal manner, they can legally become [[wild pitch]]es or [[passed ball]]s. Likewise, a baserunner can attempt to [[stolen base|steal]] a base, or the batter can choose to swing at an intentional ball; however, these rarely occur since taking these risks is rarely more beneficial to the offensive team than allowing the walk. In the Major Leagues, the most recent example of a swing at an intentional ball resulting in a hit occurred during a June 22, 2006 game between the [[Florida Marlins]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In the top of the 10th inning, with a runner on second base, Baltimore pitcher [[Todd Williams]] was signaled to intentionally walk the Marlins' [[Miguel Cabrera]]. Noticing that the intentional ball came in too close to the plate, Cabrera swung at the ball, resulting in a base hit, and a run scored for Florida.<ref>{{cite news\n |author= \n |title=Marlins' Cabrera spoils intentional walk in win \n |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13493228/ \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419212858/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13493228/ \n |dead-url=yes \n |archive-date=2007-04-19 \n |publisher=espn.com \n |date=2006-06-22 \n |accessdate=2007-06-02 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nIntentional walks also carry other nuanced risks.  They might give the subsequent batter the strategic advantage of anticipating that the pitcher will avoid walking him.  This subsequent batter might then more aggressively anticipate a pitch in the strike zone.  If this batter guesses correctly, he could achieve more success than he otherwise would.  Moreover, a subsequent batter might perceive an immediately preceding intentional walk as a slight to his abilities; if such a batter performs better when he feels underestimated by his opposition, an intentional walk could provide a spark.\n\nThough intentional walks are recorded as such in the records of the [[official scorer]], they are combined with standard, non-intentional walks when calculating a player's on-base percentage, and have only received a separate column in a player's statistics since [[1955 in baseball|1955]].\n\nBatters, on occasion, have been given intentional walks with the bases loaded (effectively giving the offensive team a risk-free run), although this occurs very infrequently.<ref>Holtzman, Jerome (May 2000).

As of 2017, the manager may simply request to the plate umpire to let the batter go to first instead of having the pitcher waste four outside pitches.\n\n[[Barry Bonds]] is the all-time record holder with 688 intentional bases on balls.

crede.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Joe Crede]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] after being hit by a pitch]]\nIn [[baseball]], '''hit by pitch''' ('''HBP''') is a situation in which a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the [[pitcher]]; the batter is called a '''hit batsman''' ('''HB'''). A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or \"crowding\", home plate.\n\n==Official rule==\nPer baseball official rule 5.05(b), a batter becomes a [[baserunning|baserunner]] and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat):\n*is touched by a pitched ball outside the [[strike zone]],\n*''and'' he attempts to avoid it (or had no opportunity to avoid it),\n*''and'' he did not swing at the pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\nIf all these conditions are met, the ball is dead, and other baserunners advance if they are forced to vacate their base by the batter taking first. Rule 5.09(a) further clarifies that a hit by pitch is also called when a pitch touches a batter's clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/ball_in_play_5.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nIn the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is [[dead ball#Baseball|dead]] and a [[strike zone|strike]] is called.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball}}</ref> If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled either a strike if in the strike zone or a ball if out of the strike zone. Umpires rarely make this call. A famous instance of a non-hit by pitch was on May 31, 1968, when [[Don Drysdale]] hit [[Dick Dietz]] with a pitch that would have forced in a run and ended Drysdale's scoreless innings streak at 44. Umpire [[Harry Wendelstedt]] ruled that Dietz made no effort to avoid the pitch; Dietz proceeded to [[fly out]], and Drysdale's scoreless streak continued to a then-record 58{{fraction|2|3}} innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050629&content_id=1108528&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl|title=Former All-Star catcher Dick Dietz dies|work=Atlanta Braves}}</ref>\n\nA hit-by-pitch can also be called on a pitch that has first touched the ground before hitting the batter. Such a bouncing pitch is like any other, and if a batter is hit by such a pitch, he will be awarded first unless he made no attempt to avoid it (and he had an opportunity to avoid it).\n\nA batter hit by a pitch is not credited with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] or [[at bat]], but is credited with a [[times on base|time on base]] and a [[plate appearance]]; therefore, being hit by a pitch does not increase or decrease a player's [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] but does increase his [[on-base percentage]]. A batter hit by a pitch with the [[bases loaded]] is also credited with an [[Run batted in|RBI]] per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2).<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf Divisions Of The Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's [[pitch count]], since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.\n\nThe rule awarding first base to a batter hit by a pitch was instituted in 1887.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm Baseball Rules Chronology: 1845\u20131899 | BaseballLibrary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829014513/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology.stm |date=2014-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Tactical use==\n[[Inside pitching]] is a common and legal tactic in [[baseball]], and many players make use of [[brushback pitch]]es, or pitches aimed underneath the chin, commonly referred to as \"chin music\", to keep players away from the [[home plate|plate]]. \"Headhunter\" is a common term for pitchers who have a reputation for throwing these kinds of pitches. However, throwing at a batter intentionally is illegal, and can be very dangerous. When an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] suspects that a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, but is not certain, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the [[manager (baseball)|managers]] of both teams. From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game. Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a [[beanball]]) can result in the immediate ejection of the pitcher, and the manager if he ordered the beanball, even without a warning. If the umpire is certain that the pitcher intentionally hit the batter with the pitch, the pitcher is ejected from the game with no warning.\n\nOften, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control. Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a \"plunking\"). These pitches are often aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else. The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act. The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter [[charging the mound]], [[bench-clearing brawl]]s, and several ejections. The strategy in these games can vary by the circumstances the teams are playing in within major league games, as [[American League]] pitchers are prevented from facing the opposing pitcher in intra-league games due to the [[designated hitter]] rule outside rare circumstances. In [[National League]] games and [[Interleague play|interleague games]] at National League home parks, pitchers must always bat for themselves and open themselves up to direct retaliation, though one of baseball's unsaid rules makes hitting a fellow pitcher a serious breach of baseball etiquette.\n\n==Records==\n{{See also|List of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders}}\nThe all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch is held by [[Hughie Jennings]], who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-era record is held by [[Craig Biggio]] of the [[Houston Astros]], who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired. Prior to Biggio, the modern-era record belonged to [[Don Baylor]], who was hit 267 times.\n\nThe all-time single-season record also belongs to Jennings, who was hit 51 times during the 1896 season. [[Ron Hunt]] of the 1971 [[Montreal Expos]] was hit 50 times during that year, the modern-era record. The single-game record is three, held by numerous players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp2.shtml|title=Hit by a Pitch Records by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com}}</ref>\n\nThe all-time record for pitchers is held by [[Gus Weyhing]] with 277 (1887\u20131901). The modern-era career pitching record for most hit batsmen is 205 by Hall-of-Famer [[Walter Johnson]]. The season record is 54 by [[Phil Knell]] in 1891, and the game record is six, held by Ed Knouff and John Grimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_hbp.shtml|title=Hit Batsmen Records by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com}}</ref>\n[[Brady Anderson]] was the first player to be hit by a pitch two times in the same inning in an [[American League]] game. On April 25, 2014, [[Brandon Moss]] became the second when he was hit twice in the top of the 9th inning by [[Houston Astros]] pitchers. Five players have been hit by a pitch twice in the same inning in the [[National League]].\n\nTwice has a perfect game been busted by the 27th batter being hit by pitch. [[Hooks Wiltse]] and [[Max Scherzer]] hold this rare feat. Both finished with no-hitters after the hit by pitch. Scherzer's team was leading 6-0 when he pitched his no-hitter, but Wiltse's team was scoreless through 9; he pitched a 10-inning 1\u20130 no-hitter. The record for most hit batters in a no-hitter is three, held by [[Chris Heston]] of the San Francisco Giants for his 2015 effort against the New York Mets.<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Casella|title=The Most Unconventional No-Hitters|url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/129863414/edwin-jackson-aj-burnett-unusual-no-hitters-chris-heston|publisher=Sports on Earth|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPostseason career records are held by Greg Maddux and Tim Wakefield\u2014each of whom hit 9 batters\u2014and Shane Victorino, who was hit by pitch 11 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/tiny/InigA|title=Postseason Pitching Event Finder: From 1903 to 2017, All Teams, Hit By Pitches|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Dangers==\nOne major league player died as a result of being struck by a pitch: [[Ray Chapman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] was hit in the head by [[Carl Mays]] on August 16, 1920, and died the next morning.\n\nSerious injuries may result from being hit by a pitch, even when wearing a helmet. On August 18, 1967, [[Red Sox]] batter [[Tony Conigliaro]] was hit almost directly in the left eye by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[California Angels]]. His cheekbone was shattered; he nearly lost the sight of the eye, was unable to play for over a year, and never regained his earlier batting ability. Batting helmets at the time were not required to have an \"ear flap\"; it was not until 2002 that all Major League batters were required to wear helmets with side-protection. On September 28, 1995, [[Kirby Puckett]], of the [[Minnesota Twins]], was struck in the cheek by a [[Dennis Mart\u00ednez]] fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last regular-season game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career. Most recently, [[Mike Piazza]], then of the [[New York Mets]], was hit in the head by a pitch from [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] on September 10, 2005. His helmet shattered, and he suffered a [[concussion]]. Other relatively minor injuries that are possible include broken fingers or hands, broken feet, broken ribs, injuries to the knee, or [[groin]] injuries.\n\n==Legal consequences==\n\nSince inside pitching is a legitimate tactic in baseball, courts have recognized that being hit by a pitch is an inherent risk of the game, so that players cannot sue for any resulting injuries. On April 6, 2006, in a case arising from a game involving [[community college]] baseball teams, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that baseball players in California [[Assumption of risk|assume the risk]] of being hit by baseballs ''even if'' the balls were intentionally thrown so as to cause injury.<ref>''Avila v. Citrus Community College Dist.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/38C4t148.htm 38 Cal. 4th 148] (2006).</ref> In the court's words: \"For better or worse, being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball. It is not the function of [[tort law]] to police such conduct.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n* [https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HBP_career.shtml List of all-time HBP leaders]\n\n* [http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-hbp-explosion-that-almost-nobody-seems-to-have-noticed/ Article on changing HBP rates] in [[The Hardball Times]]\n\n{{Baseball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hit By Pitch}}\n[[Category:Baseball rules]]\n[[Category:Baseball pitching]]\n[[Category:Baseball terminology]]\n[[Category:Batting statistics]]\n[[Category:Pitching statistics]]", "sha1": "jnrxzwsf2wymk6lf2u6dd3735o19d4h"}}, {"title": "Hit (baseball)", "ns": "0", "id": "3807", "revision": {"id": "865930823", "parentid": "841431788", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T03:32:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ianblair23", "id": "145927"}, "comment": "link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Pete Rose 2008.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Pete Rose]] is the all-time leader in [[Major League Baseball]] hits, recording 4,256.]]\n[[File:Ichiro Suzuki on June 18, 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Ichiro Suzuki]] has recorded the most career hits across top tier professional leagues, combining his current Major League hits with his previous 1,278 hits in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]].]]\n\nIn [[baseball statistics]], a '''hit''' (denoted by '''H'''), also called a '''base hit''', is credited to a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] when the batter safely reaches [[First baseman|first base]] after hitting the ball into [[fair ball|fair]] territory, without the benefit of an [[error (baseball)|error]] or a [[fielder's choice]].\n\n==Scoring a hit==\nTo achieve a hit, the batter must reach first base before any fielder can either [[tag out|tag]] him with the ball, throw to another player protecting the base before the batter reaches it, or [[force play|tag first base]] while carrying the ball. The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely; if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a [[double (baseball)|double]] or [[triple (baseball)|triple]] or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play).\n\nIf a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.\n\n===Types of hits===\nA hit for one base is called a [[single (baseball)|single]], for two bases a [[double (baseball)|double]], and for three bases a [[triple (baseball)|triple]].  A [[home run]] is also scored as a hit.  Doubles, triples, and home runs are also called [[extra base hit]]s.\n\nAn \"[[infield hit]]\" is a hit where the ball does not leave the infield.  Infield hits are uncommon by nature, and most often earned by speedy runners.\n\n==Pitching a no-hitter==\nA [[no-hitter]] is a game in which one of the teams prevented the other from getting a hit. Throwing a no-hitter is rare and considered an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. In most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game.  A pitcher who throws a no-hitter could still allow runners to reach base safely, by way of [[base on balls|walk]]s, [[error (baseball)|error]]s, [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]], or batter reaching base due to interference or obstruction.  If the pitcher allows no runners to reach base in any manner whatsoever (hit, walk, hit batsman, error, etc.), the no-hitter is a [[perfect game]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TyCobbTigers.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Ty Cobb]] recorded a career 4,191 hits, holding the Major League record for 57 years.]]\nIn [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted [[Base on balls|bases on balls]] (walks) as hits. The result was skyrocketing [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]s, including some near .500; [[Tip O'Neill (baseball)|Tip O'Neill]] of the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] batted .485 that season, which would still be a major league record if recognized. The experiment was abandoned the following season.\n\nThere is controversy regarding how the records of 1887 should be interpreted. The number of legitimate walks and at-bats are known for all players that year, so computing averages using the same method as in other years is straightforward. In 1968, Major League Baseball formed a Special Baseball Records Committee to resolve this (and other) issues.  The Committee ruled that walks in 1887 should not be counted as hits.  In 2000, Major League Baseball reversed its decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Most current sources list O'Neill's 1887 average as .435, as calculated by omitting his walks.  He would retain his [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] batting championship. However, the variance between methods results in differing recognition for the 1887 [[National League]] batting champion.  [[Cap Anson]] would be recognized, with his .421 average, if walks are included, but [[Sam Thompson]] would be the champion at .372 if they are not.\n\n==Major League Baseball rules==\nThe official rulebook of [[Major League Baseball]] states in Rule 10.05:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp|title=Official Rules|author=|date=|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n::(a) The official scorer shall credit a batter with a base hit when:\n:(1) the batter reaches first base (or any succeeding base) safely on a fair ball that settles on the ground, that touches a fence before being touched by a fielder or that clears a fence;\n:(2) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball hit with such force, or so slowly, that any fielder attempting to make a play with the ball has no opportunity to do so;\n::Rule 10.05(a)(2) Comment: The official scorer shall credit a hit if the fielder attempting to handle the ball cannot make a play, even if such fielder deflects the ball from or cuts off another fielder who could have put out a runner.\n:(3) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that takes an unnatural bounce so that a fielder cannot handle it with ordinary effort, or that touches the pitcher's plate or any base (including home plate) before being touched by a fielder and bounces so that a fielder cannot handle the ball with ordinary effort;\n:(4) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder and that is in fair territory when the ball reaches the outfield, unless in the scorer's judgment the ball could have been handled with ordinary effort;\n:(5) a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder touches a runner or an umpire, unless a runner is called out for having been touched by an Infield Fly, in which case the official scorer shall not score a hit; or\n:(6) a fielder unsuccessfully attempts to put out a preceding runner and, in the official scorer's judgment, the batter-runner would not have been put out at first base by ordinary effort.\nRule 10.05(a) Comment: In applying Rule 10.05(a), the official scorer shall always give the batter the benefit of the doubt. A safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout.\n\n::(b) The official scorer shall not credit a base hit when a:\n:(1) runner is forced out by a batted ball, or would have been forced out except for a fielding error;\n:(2) batter apparently hits safely and a runner who is forced to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner fails to touch the first base to which such runner is advancing and is called out on appeal. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;\n:(3) pitcher, the catcher or any infielder handles a batted ball and puts out a preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base or to return to his original base, or would have put out such runner with ordinary effort except for a fielding error. The official scorer shall charge the batter with an at-bat but not a hit;\n:(4) fielder fails in an attempt to put out a preceding runner and, in the scorer's judgment, the batter-runner could have been put out at first base; or\n::Rule 10.05(b) Comment: Rule 10.05(b) shall not apply if the fielder merely looks toward or feints toward another base before attempting to make the putout at first base.\n:(5) runner is called out for interference with a fielder attempting to field a batted ball, unless in the scorer's judgment the batter-runner would have been safe had the interference not occurred.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n* [[List of Major League Baseball hit records]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball progressive career hits leaders]]\n* [[List of Nippon Professional Baseball career hits leaders]]\n* [[List of KBO Career Hits leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players with 2,000 hits]]\n* [[3,000 hit club]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Baseball statistics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hit (Baseball)}}\n[[Category:Batting statistics]]\n[[Category:Baseball rules]]", "sha1": "auuhbodr6re2ci77865mflk1wm6qlz1"}}, {"title": "On-base percentage", "ns": "0", "id": "3808", "revision": {"id": "856981399", "parentid": "856981236", "timestamp": "2018-08-28T19:38:27Z", "contributor": {"ip": "98.103.210.82"}, "comment": "/* All-time leaders */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}\nIn [[baseball statistics]], '''on-base percentage''' (OBP; sometimes referred to as '''on-base average/OBA''', as the statistic is rarely presented as a true [[percentage]]) is a statistic generally measuring how frequently a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] reaches [[base (baseball)|base]].<ref name=\"Glossary\">{{cite web |title=Glossary / Standard Stats / On-base Percentage (OBP)  |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/on-base-percentage  |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Specifically, it records the ratio of the batter's [[Times on base|times-on-base (TOB)]] (the sum of [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], [[Base on balls|walks]], and times [[Hit by pitch|hit by pitch]]) to their number of plate appearances.<ref name=\"Glossary\"/> It first became an official [[MLB]] statistic in 1984.\n\nBy factoring in only hits, walks and times hit by pitch, OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base due to fielding errors or decisions, as it does not increase when the batter reaches base due to [[error (baseball)|fielding error]], [[fielder's choice]], [[Uncaught third strike|dropped/uncaught third strike]], [[Obstruction (baseball)|fielder's obstruction]], or [[catcher's interference]].\n\nOn-base percentage is added to [[slugging average]] to determine [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS).

On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The record for the highest career OBP by a hitter, based on over 3000 [[plate appearance]]s, is .482 by [[Ted Williams]].

'''sacrifice fly''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''sac fly''') is defined by Rule 9.08(d) <ref name=\"MLB Rules\">http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_rules.jsp</ref>:\n\"Score a sacrifice fly when, before two are out, the batter hits a ball in flight handled by an outfielder or an infielder running in the outfield in fair or foul territory that\n# is caught, and a run scores after the catch, or\n# is dropped, and a runner scores, if in the scorer's judgment the runner could have scored after the catch had the fly ball been caught.\"\n\nIt is called a \"sacrifice\" fly because the batter allows a teammate to score a run, while sacrificing his own ability to do so. Sacrifice flies are traditionally recorded in [[box score (baseball)|box scores]] with the designation \"SF\".\n\n== Rules ==\n\nAs addressed within Rule 9.02(a)(1) of the Official Baseball Rules<ref name=\"MLB Rules\"/> a sacrifice fly is not counted as a time [[at bat]] for the batter, though the batter is credited with a [[run batted in]].\n\nThe purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at-bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful action. The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the [[sacrifice hit]] (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], it counts as a [[plate appearance]] and lowers his [[on-base percentage]]. A player on a [[hitting streak]] will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly. \n\nThe reason for this is that the sacrifice fly, unlike the sacrifice bunt, is not considered a tactical maneuver (players don't try to hit a fly ball to advance a runner). Unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is only credited if a runner scores on the play.  Therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given and the batter is charged with an at-bat. Also, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error) the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly, as well as a second RBI if a runner on third also scores. At the professional level this will only typically occur in unusual circumstances that prevent the defense from making an immediate throw back to the infield, such as an outfielder colliding with the wall while making a catch on the warning track. \n\nThe sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out so long as the run scores.  The sacrifice fly is credited on a dropped ball even if another runner is forced out by reason of the batter becoming a runner. \n\nOn any fly ball, a runner can attempt to advance bases right as soon as a fielder touches the ball by tagging up, even before the fielder has full control of the ball.\n\n==Records==\nThe most sacrifice flies by a team in one game is five; the record was established by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1988, tied by the [[Colorado Rockies]] in 2006,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260607127|title=Torrealba's slam, five sac flies power Rockies past Bucs|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 7, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> and tied again by the Mariners in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2004351837&zsection_id=2002990524&slug=mari16&date=20080416|title=Seattle Mariners ride flurry of sacrifice flies to 11-6 victory over Kansas City Royals|date=April 16, 2008|first=Larry|last=Stone|publisher=Seattle Times}}.</ref> \n\nFive teams have collected three sacrifice flies in an inning: the [[Chicago White Sox]] (fifth inning, July 1, 1962 against the [[Cleveland Indians]]); the [[New York Yankees]] twice (fourth inning, June 29, 2000 against the [[Detroit Tigers]] and third inning, August 19, 2000 against the [[Anaheim Angels]]); the [[New York Mets]] (second inning, June 24, 2005 against the Yankees); and the [[Houston Astros]] (seventh inning, June 26, 2005 against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]).<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/sacrifice_flies_records.shtml]</ref>  In these cases one or more of the flies did not result in a putout due to an error.\n\nSince the rule was reinstated in its present form in 1954, [[Gil Hodges]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers| Dodgers]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in one season with 19, in 1954;<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_season.shtml Single Season Records], baseball-reference.com.</ref> [[Eddie Murray]] holds the record for most sacrifice flies in a career with 128.<ref name=bbrefcareer>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SF_career.shtml|title=Career Leaders & Records for Sacrifice Flies|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs of the end of the [[2008 in baseball|2008 season]], players who have hit 115 or more career sacrifice flies:\n\n1.

The sacrifice fly as a statistical category was instituted in 1908, only to be discontinued in 1931. The rule was again adopted in 1939, only to be eliminated again in 1940, before being adopted for the last time in 1954.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp ''MLB'' Official Rules from the [[Major League Baseball]] website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615020809/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/excerpts/rules_chronology2.stm Chronology that includes the chronology of the sacrifice fly rule], from baseballlibrary.com\n*[http://research.sabr.org/journals/sacrifice-fly The Sacrifice Fly], from the SABR web site (Research Journals Archive)\n{{Baseball}}{{Baseball statistics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sacrifice Fly}}\n[[Category:Baseball plays]]\n[[Category:Batting (baseball)]]", "sha1": "m056lwl9rhcmddr61whd2rs7ontqw9i"}}, {"title": "On-base plus slugging", "ns": "0", "id": "3810", "revision": {"id": "856345547", "parentid": "856341016", "timestamp": "2018-08-24T15:27:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jameboy", "id": "1302184"}, "comment": "/* Leaders */ 10 is surely sufficient for a summary. top 100 list is available via the italicised link if reader requires it", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n}}\n\n'''On-base plus slugging (OPS)''' is a [[Sabermetrics|sabermetric]] [[baseball statistics|baseball statistic]] calculated as the sum of a player's [[on-base percentage]] and [[slugging percentage|slugging average]].<ref>See [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?mode=viewstat&stat=118 www.baseballprospectus.com] or [http://www.baseball1.com/faqs/glossary.html#O rec.sport.baseball].</ref> The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important offensive skills, are represented. An OPS of .900 or higher in [[Major League Baseball]] puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters. Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark.\n\n==Equation==\nThe basic equation is\n\n<math>OPS = OBP + SLG \\,</math>\n<!-- Please retain \\, above for proper rendering -->\n\nwhere OBP is [[on-base percentage]] and SLG is [[Slugging percentage|slugging average]]. These averages are defined\n\n<math>SLG = \\frac{TB} {AB}</math>\n\nand\n\n<math>OBP = \\frac{H+BB+HBP} {AB+BB+SF+HBP}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''H'' = [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]\n* ''BB'' = [[Base on balls|bases on balls]]\n* ''HBP'' = times [[hit by pitch]]\n* ''AB'' = [[at bats]]\n* ''SF'' = [[Sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]]\n* ''TB'' = [[total bases]]\n\nIn one equation, OPS can be represented as:\n\n<math>OPS = \\frac{AB*(H+BB+HBP)+TB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}{AB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}</math>\n\n==Interpretation of OPS==\n\nOPS does not present a complete picture of a player's offensive contributions.  OPS does not consider such factors as [[baserunning]], [[stolen base|basestealing]], and the [[clutch hitter|leverage/timeliness of performance]].\n\nMore expansive sabermetric measurements do attempt to incorporate some or all of the above mentioned factors.  Nonetheless, even though it does not include them, OPS correlates quite well with team run scoring.\n\nOther sabermetric stats, such as [[runs created]] and [[Wins Above Replacement]], attempt to express a player's contribution directly in terms of runs and/or wins.  However, a player's OPS does not have a simple intrinsic meaning.\n\nOPS is a convenient but controversial measurement. OPS weighs on-base percentage and slugging average equally.  However, on-base percentage correlates better with scoring runs.<ref>Lewis, Michael. <u>Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game</u>, 2003.</ref> Statistics such as [[wOBA]] build on this distinction using [[linear weights]]. Additionally, the components of OPS are not typically equal (league-average slugging percentages are usually 75\u2013100 points higher than league-average on-base percentages). As a point of reference, the OPS for all of Major League Baseball in 2008 was .749.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-standard-batting.shtml|title=2008 Major League Baseball Standard Batting - Baseball-Reference.com|author=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\n==An OPS scale==\n[[Bill James]], in his essay titled \"The 96 Families of Hitters\"<ref>James, Bill. ''The 96 Families of Hitters''. <u>The Bill James Gold Mine</u>, 2009, p.24.</ref> uses seven different categories for classification by OPS:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Category !! Classification !! OPS Range\n|-\n| A || Great || .9000 and Higher\n|-\n| B || Very Good || .8334 to .8999\n|-\n| C || Above Average || .7667 to .8333\n|-\n| D || Average || .7000 to .7666\n|-\n| E || Below Average || .6334 to .6999\n|-\n| F || Poor || .5667 to .6333\n|-\n| G || Very Poor || .5666 and Lower\n|}\n\nThis effectively transforms OPS into a 7-point ordinal scale. Substituting quality labels such as Excellent (A), Very Good (B), Good (C), Average (D), Fair (E), Poor (F) and Very Poor (G) for the A\u2013G categories creates a subjective reference for OPS values.\n\n==History==\nOn-base plus slugging was first popularized in 1984 by [[John Thorn]] and [[Pete Palmer]]'s book, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball''.<ref>John Thorn and Pete Palmer, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball,'' pp. 69-70.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' then began carrying the leaders in this statistic in its weekly \"By the Numbers\" box, a feature that continued for four years. Baseball journalist [[Peter Gammons]] used and evangelized the statistic, and other writers and broadcasters picked it up. The popularity of OPS gradually spread, and by 2004 it began appearing on [[Topps]] baseball cards.<ref>[[Alan Schwarz]], ''The Numbers Game,'' pp. 165, 233.</ref>\n\nOPS was formerly sometimes known as \"Production.\" For instance, in early versions of Thorn's ''[[Total Baseball]]'' encyclopedia, and in the ''[[Strat-O-Matic]]'' computer baseball game.  This term has fallen out of use.\n\nOPS gained in popularity because team average OPS correlates well with team runs scored. However, it is not mathematically legitimate to use this correlation to assume that individual OPS correlates as well with individual runs created, nor is it legitimate to assume that individual OBP (On Base Percentage) correlates well with individual runs created. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to measure individual runs created.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Leaders==\n{{Further|List of Major League Baseball career OPS leaders}}\nThe top ten [[Major League Baseball]] players in lifetime OPS, with at least 3,000 plate appearances through the end of the 2016 season and halfway through 2017 season, are:\n\n# [[Babe Ruth]], 1.1636\n# [[Ted Williams]], 1.1155\n# [[Lou Gehrig]], 1.0798\n# [[Barry Bonds]], 1.0512\n# [[Jimmie Foxx]], 1.0376\n# [[Hank Greenberg]], 1.0169\n# [[Rogers Hornsby]], 1.0103\n# [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]], 0.9960\n# [[Mark McGwire]], 0.9823\n# '''[[Mike Trout]]''', 0.9784\n\nThe top four were all left-handed batters.

OPS+ is OPS adjusted for the park and the league in which the player played, but not for fielding position. An OPS+ of 100 is defined to be the league average. An OPS+ of 150 or more is excellent and 125 very good, while an OPS+ of 75 or below is poor.\n\nThe basic equation for OPS+ is\n\n<math>OPS+ = 100 * (\\frac{OBP} {*lgOBP} + \\frac{SLG} {*lgSLG} - 1)</math>\n\nwhere *lgOBP is the park adjusted OBP of the league (not counting pitchers hitting) and *lgSLG is the park adjusted SLG of the league.\n\nA common misconception is that OPS+ closely matches the ratio of a player's OPS to that of the league. In fact, due to the additive nature of the two components in OPS+, a player with an OBP and SLG both 50% better than league average in those metrics will have an OPS+ of 200 (twice the league average OPS+) while still having an OPS that is only 50% better than the average OPS of the league.  It would be a better (although not exact) approximation to say that a player with an OPS+ of 150 produces 50% more ''runs'', in a given set of plate appearances, as a player with an OPS+ of 100 (though see clarification above, under \"History\").\n\n===Leaders in OPS+===\nThrough the end of the 2017 season, the career top twenty leaders in OPS+ (minimum 3,000 plate appearances) were:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n&nbsp; 1.

The two primary periods in which the stolen base was popular were before 1920 and again in the 1970s and 1980s.|500px]]\nBase stealing was popular in the game's early decades, with speedsters such as [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Clyde Milan]] stealing nearly 100 bases in a season.  But the tactic fell into relative disuse after [[Babe Ruth]] introduced the era of the home run &ndash; in 1955, for example, no one in baseball stole more than 25 bases, and [[Dom DiMaggio]] won the AL stolen base title in 1950 with just 15.  However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, base-stealing was brought back to prominence primarily by [[Luis Aparicio]] and [[Maury Wills]], who broke Cobb's modern single-season record by stealing 104 bases in 1962.  Wills' record was broken in turn by [[Lou Brock]] in 1974, and [[Rickey Henderson]] in 1982.  The stolen base remained a popular tactic through the 1980s, perhaps best exemplified by [[Vince Coleman]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], but began to decline again in the 1990s as the frequency of [[home run]]s reached record heights and the steal-friendly [[artificial turf]] ballparks began to disappear.\n\nBase stealing is an important characteristic of the \"[[small ball (baseball)|small ball]]\" managing style (or \"manufacturing runs\"). Such managers emphasize \"doing the little things\" (including risky running plays like base-stealing) to advance runners and score runs, often relying on pitching and defense to keep games close.  The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of the 1960s, led by pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] and speedy shortstop [[Maury Wills]], were a successful example of this style. The antithesis of this is reliance on power hitting, exemplified by the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the 1970s, which aspired to score most of its runs via home runs.  Often the \"small ball\" model is associated with the [[National League]], while power hitting is associated with the [[American League]]. However, some successful recent American League teams, including the [[2002 in baseball|2002]] [[Anaheim Angels]], the [[2001 in baseball|2001]] [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[2005 in baseball|2005]] [[Chicago White Sox]] have excelled at \"small ball.\" The [[Kansas City Royals]] have embodied this style recently, leading the league in stolen bases but finishing last in [[home run]]s in 2013 and 2014. Successful teams often combine both styles, with a speedy runner or two complementing hitters with power, such as the 2005 White Sox, who despite playing \"small ball\", still hit 200 home runs.\n\n==Base-stealing technique==\nBaseball's Rule 8 (The Pitcher) specifies the pitching procedure in detail.  For example, in the Set Position, the pitcher must \"com[e] to a complete stop\"; thereafter, \"any natural motion associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without alteration or interruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2007/08_the_pitcher.pdf|title=Rule 8.01(b)|work=mlb.com|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>  A runner intending to \"steal on the pitcher\" breaks for the next base the moment the pitcher commits to pitch to home plate.  The pitcher cannot abort the pitch and try to put the runner out; this is a [[Balk (baseball)|balk]] under Rule 8.\n\nIf the runner breaks too soon (before the pitcher is obliged to complete a pitch), the pitcher may throw to a base rather than pitch, and the runner is usually ''picked off'' by being tagged out between the bases.  Past this moment, any delay in the runner's break makes it more likely that the catcher, after receiving the pitch, will be able to throw the runner out at the destination base.\n\nBefore the pitch, the runner takes a ''lead-off'', walking several steps away from the base as a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] toward the next base.  Even a runner who does not intend to steal takes a ''secondary lead'' of a few more steps, once the pitcher has legally committed to complete the pitch.\n\nThe pitcher may, without limit, throw the ball to the runner's base.  The runner must return to that base or risk being tagged out; but the underlying strategy is thereby to dissuade the runner from too big a lead-off; that is, to ''hold the runner on'' his original base.\n\nThe more adept base stealers are proficient at ''reading the pickoff'', meaning that they can detect certain ''tells'' (tell-tale signs) in a pitcher's pre-pitch movements or mannerisms that indicate the pickoff attempt is or is not imminent. For example, one experienced base stealer noted that careless pitchers dig the toes on their back foot into the ground when they are about to pitch in order to get a better push off, but when they intend to turn and throw a pickoff, they do not.<ref name=\"mahony1\">Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com/ www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}</ref>\n\nIf a batted ball is caught on the fly, the runner must return to his original base.  In this case, a runner trying to steal is more likely to be caught off his original base, resulting in a [[double play]].  This is a minor risk of a steal attempt.  It is offset by the fact that a ground ball double play is less likely.\n\n==Plays involving baserunning==\nIn the ''[[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run play]]'', coaches coordinate the actions of runner and batter.  The runner tries to steal and the batter swings at almost any pitch, if only to distract the catcher.  If the batter makes contact, the runner has a greater chance of reaching the next base; if the batter gets a base hit, the runner may be able to take an extra base.  If the batter fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt.\n\nIn the ''delayed steal'', the runner does not take advantage of the pitcher's duty to complete a pitch, but relies on surprise and takes advantage of any complacency by the fielders.  The runner gives the impression he is not trying to steal, and does not break for the next base until the ball crosses the plate.  It is rare for Major League defenses to be fooled, but the play is used effectively at the college level. The first delayed steal on record was performed by [[Miller Huggins]] in 1903.<ref name=cincy>{{cite news|title=Huggins cornerstone to Yankees|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|first=Lonnie|last=Wheeler|date=June 3, 2003}}</ref> The delayed steal was famously practiced by [[Eddie Stanky]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Team that Forever Changed Baseball and America: The 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|year=2012|isbn=9780803239920|location=|pages=155}}</ref>\n\n[[Second base]] is the base most often stolen, because once a runner is on second base he is considered to be in ''scoring position'', meaning that he is expected to be able to run home and score on most routine singles hit into the outfield.<ref name=\"mahony1\"/> Second base is also the easiest to steal, as it is farthest from home plate and thus a longer throw from the catcher is required to prevent it.  [[Third base]] is a shorter throw for the catcher, but the runner is able to take a longer lead off second base and can leave for third base earlier against a left-handed pitcher. A steal of [[home plate]] is the riskiest, as the catcher only needs to tag out the runner after receiving the ball from the pitcher. It is difficult for the runner to cover the distance between the bases before the ball arrives home. [[Ty Cobb]] holds the records for most steals of home in a single season (8) as well as for a career (54).<ref name=BBAlm>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_stbah.shtml |title=Stealing Home Base Records |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref>  Steals of home are not officially recorded statistics, and must be researched through individual game accounts.  Thus Cobb's totals may be even greater than is recorded.<ref name=BBAlm /> [[Jackie Robinson]] famously stole home in Game 1 of the [[1955 World Series]]. Thirty-five games have ended with a runner stealing home, but only two have occurred since 1980.<ref>Larson, J. \"Stolen Victories.\" Baseball Research Journal #36, p. 116-119. 2007.</ref> In a variation on the steal of home, the batter is signaled to simultaneously execute a [[sacrifice bunt]], which results in the ''[[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]].'' The ''suicide squeeze'' is a squeeze in which the runner on third begins to steal home without seeing the outcome of the bunt; it is so named because if the batter fails to bunt, the runner will surely be out. In contrast, when the runner on third does not commit until seeing that the ball is bunted advantageously, it is called a ''safety squeeze.''\n\nIn more recent years, most steals of home involve a ''delayed double steal'', in which a runner on first attempts to steal second, while the runner on third breaks for home as soon as the catcher throws to second base. If it is important to prevent the run from scoring, the catcher may hold on to the ball (conceding the steal of second) or may throw to the pitcher; this may deceive the runner at third and the pitcher may throw back to the catcher for the out.\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Granderson-20th stolen base 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Curtis Granderson]] steals a base.]]\nIn [[baseball statistics]], stolen bases are denoted by '''SB'''. Attempts to steal that result in the baserunner being out are ''[[caught stealing]]'' ('''CS'''). The sum of these statistics is ''steal attempts.'' Successful steals as a percentage of total steal attempts is called the ''success rate.''\n\nThe rule on stolen bases<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp|title=Official Rules: Rule 10.07(g)|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> states that:\n*Advances that are credited to some other play are not steal attempts. For example, on a wild pitch or a passed ball, the [[official scorer]] must notice whether the runner broke for the next base before the pitch got away.\n*As usual, statistics in the case of a defensive [[Error (baseball)|error]] are based on error-free play.  If a runner would have been out, but for the error, it is scored as \"caught stealing, safe on the error.\" A catcher does not commit an error by throwing poorly to the destination base, but if any runner takes an extra base on the bad throw, it is \"stolen base plus error.\"\n*There is no steal attempt on a dead ball, whether the runner is sent back to the original base (as on a foul ball) or is awarded the next base (as on a hit batsman). On a base award when the ball is live (such as a walk), the runner could make a steal attempt beyond the base awarded.\n*Cases where the defense intentionally allows the runner to advance without attempting to put him out are scored as ''defensive indifference'', also called ''fielder's indifference''.<ref name=\"jackcurry\">Curry, Jack [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/sports/baseball/23score.html?ref=sports \"Safe at Second, but No Stolen Base to Show for It\"] ''The New York Times'', Wednesday, September 23, 2009</ref> This is usually only scored late in games when it is clear that the defense's priority is getting the batter out. The lack of a putout attempt does not by itself indicate defensive indifference; the official scorer must also factor in the game situation and the defensive players' actions. \n\nRelative skill at stealing bases can be judged by evaluating either a player's total number of steals or the success rate. Noted statistician [[Bill James]] has argued that unless a player has a high success rate (67-70% or better), the stolen base may be detrimental to a team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/stats.shtml |title=Offensive Stats 101|publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref>\n\nComparing skill against players from other eras is problematic, because the definition has not been constant.  Caught stealing was not recorded regularly until the middle of the 20th century. [[Ty Cobb]], for example, was known as a great base-stealer, with 892 steals and a success rate of over 83%. However, the data on Cobb's caught stealing is missing from 12 seasons, strongly suggesting he was unsuccessful many more times than his stats indicate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/cobbty01.shtml |title=Ty Cobb|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]], with 286 steals, has the highest career success rate of all players with over 300 stolen base attempts, at 88.3%.\n\n==Evolution of rules and scoring==\n[[File:Lastings Milledge and Luis Castillo.jpg|thumb|[[Lastings Milledge]] steals a base.]]\nThe first mention of the stolen base as a statistic was in the 1877 scoring rules adopted by the [[National League]], which noted credit toward a player's [[total bases]] when a base is stolen.<ref name=\"Total Baseball2413\">''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Scoring rules for 1877-- Batting'', p. 2413</ref>  It was not until 1886 that the stolen base appeared as something to be tracked, but was only to \"appear in the summary of the game\".<ref name=\"Total Baseball2414\">''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878\u20131996'', p. 2414</ref>\n\nIn 1887, the stolen base was given its own individual statistical column in the [[box score]], and was defined for purposes of scoring: \"...every base made after first base has been reached by a base runner, except for those made by reason of or with the aid of a battery error ([[wild pitch]] or [[passed ball]]), or by batting, [[balk]]s or by being forced off.

This rule also clarified that advancement of another base(s) beyond the one being stolen is not credited as a stolen base on the same play, and that an error is charged to the fielder who permitted the extra advancement. There was clarification that a runner is credited with a steal if the attempt began before a battery error. Finally, batters were credited with a stolen base if they were tagged out after over running the base.<ref name=\"Total Baseball2415\" />\n\nIn 1892, a rule credited runners with stolen bases if a base runner advanced on a fly out, or if they advanced more than one base on any safe hit or attempted out, providing an attempt was made by the defense to put the runner out.<ref name=\"Total Baseball2415\" />  The rule was rescinded in 1897.<ref name=\"Total Baseball2415\" />\n\nIn 1898, stolen base scoring was narrowed to no longer include advancement in the event of a fielding error, or advancement caused by a hit batsman.<ref name=\"Total Baseball2416\">''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878\u20131996'', p. 2416</ref>\n\n1904 saw an attempt to reduce the already wordy slew of rules governing stolen bases, with the stolen base now credited when \"...the {{sic|base|runner}} advances a base unaided by a base hit, a put out, (or) a fielding or batter error.\"<ref name=\"Total Baseball2417\">''Total Baseball, 5th ed.'', 1997, Viking Press, Thorn, John et al. ed, ''Chronology of Scoring Rules 1878\u20131996'', p. 2417</ref>\n\n1910 saw the first addressing of the double and triple steal attempts.

A player completes a turn batting when: he [[strikeout|strikes out]] or is declared [[out (baseball)|out]] before reaching first base; or he reaches first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]] or is awarded first base (by a [[base on balls]], [[hit by pitch]], or [[catcher's interference]]); or he hits a [[fair ball]] which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (''see also'' [[left on base]], [[fielder's choice]], [[force play]]). In other words, a plate appearance ends when the batter is put out or becomes a runner. A very similar statistic, [[at bat]]s, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.\n\n== Uses ==\nWhile at bats are used to calculate such important player hitting statistics as [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]s, [[slugging percentage]]s and [[on-base percentage]]s, plate appearances have no such statistical value. However, at season's end, a player must have accumulated 502 plate appearances during a season to be ranked in any of these categories. For example, suppose Player A, with 510 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 100 hits during the season and finishes with a .250 batting average. And suppose Player B, with 490 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 110 hits during the season and finishes the season with a .275 batting average. Player B, even though he had the same amount of at bats as Player A and even though his batting average is higher, will not be eligible for season-ending rankings because he did not accumulate the required 502 plate appearances, while Player A did and therefore will be eligible.<ref name=\"Mahony\">Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Exception for batting titles ===\nRule 9.22(a) of the [[Official Baseball Rules]] make a single allowance to the minimum requirement of 502 plate appearances for the purposes of determining the batting, slugging or on-base percentage title. If a player:\n\n* leads the league in one of the statistics;\n* does not have the required 502 plate appearances; and\n* would still lead the league in that statistic if as many at bats (without hits or reaching base) were added to his records as necessary to meet the requirement,\n\nhe will win that title, but with his original statistic (before the extra at bats were added).\n\nIn the example above, Player B is 12 plate appearances short of the required 502, but were he be charged with 12 additional at bats, he would go 110-for-412 for a batting average of .267. If no one else has a batting average (similarly modified if appropriate) higher than .267, player B will be awarded the batting title (with his original batting average of .275) despite the lack of 502 plate appearances. \n\nIn a real-life example, in 2012, [[Melky Cabrera]], then of the [[San Francisco Giants]], finished the season with a league-high .346 batting average, but he had only 501 plate appearances, one short of the required 502. Per the rule, an extra at bat should have been added to his total because, after it is added and his batting average recalculated, he still would have won the batting title. Melky's case, however, turned out differently. The reason Melky finished the season with only 501 at bats was because he was suspended in mid-August when he tested positive for illegal [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. Melky was still eligible for that extra plate appearance, but he requested that that extra plate appearance not be added to his total, and that he not be considered for the batting crown, because he admitted that his use of performance-enhancing drugs had given him an unfair advantage over other players. As a result, Melky's name is nowhere to be found on the list of 2012 National League batting leaders.<ref name=\"Mahony\" />\n\n== Calculating ==\nA batter is not credited with a plate appearance if, while batting, a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., [[pickoff|picked off]], [[caught stealing]]). In this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no [[Balls and strikes (baseball)|balls]] or [[strike (baseball)|strikes]] against him.\n\nA batter is not credited with a plate appearance if, while batting, the game ends as the winning run scores from third base on a [[balk]], [[stolen base]], [[wild pitch]] or [[passed ball]].\n\nA batter may or may not be credited with a plate appearance (and possibly at-bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a [[pinch hitter]] after having already started his turn at bat. In this case, the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout.  In this case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter. (see [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp rule 10.15b])\n\n{{math|PA {{=}} AB + BB + HBP + SH + SF + Times Reached on Defensive Interference}}\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn common terminology, the term \"at bat\" is sometimes used to mean \"plate appearance\" (for example, \"he fouled off the ball to keep the ''at bat'' alive\").  The intent is usually clear from the context, although the term \"official at bat\" is sometimes used to explicitly refer to an ''at bat'' as distinguished from a ''plate appearance''. However, terms such as ''turn at bat'' or ''time at bat'' are synonymous with ''plate appearance''.\n\n=== \"Time at bat\" in the rulebook ===\nOfficial Baseball Rule 5.06(c) provides that \"[a] batter has legally completed his ''time at bat'' when he is put out or becomes a runner\" (emphasis added). The \"time at bat\" defined in this rule is more commonly referred to as a [[plate appearance]], and the playing rules (Rules 1 through 8) uses the phrase \"time at bat\" in this sense (e.g. Rule 5.04(a)(3), which states that \"[t]he first batter in each inning after the first inning shall be the player whose name follows that of the last player who legally completed his ''time at bat'' in the preceding inning\" (emphasis added). In contrast, the scoring rules uses the phrase \"time at bat\" to refer to the statistic [[at bat]], defined in Rule 9.02(a)(1), but sometimes uses the phrase \"official time at bat\" or refers back to Rule 9.02(a)(1) when mentioning the statistic. The phrase \"plate appearance\" is used in Rules 9.22 and 9.23 dealing with batting titles and hitting streaks, but is not defined anywhere in the rulebook.\n== Scoring ==\nSection 10 of the official rules states that an at bat is not counted when the player:<ref name=\"Section 10\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp Official Rules: 10.00 The Official Scorer].

Retrieved 22 May 2012.</ref>\n# hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly\n# is awarded first base on four called balls\n# is hit by a pitched ball\n# is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction\n\nThe main use of the plate appearance statistic is in determining a player's eligibility for leadership in some offensive statistical categories, notably [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]; currently, a player must have 3.1 PAs per game scheduled to qualify for the batting title (for the 162-game schedule, that means 502 PAs).<ref name=\"Section 10\"/> Also, it is often erroneously cited that total plate appearances is the divisor (i.e., denominator) used in calculating [[on-base percentage]] (OBP), an alternative measurement of a player's offensive performance; in reality, the OBP denominator does ''not'' include certain PAs, such as times reached via either catcher\u2019s interference or fielder\u2019s obstruction or Sacrifice Hits (Sacrifice Flies are included).\n\nPlate appearances are also used by scorers for \"proving\" a box score.  If the game has been scored correctly, the total number of plate appearances for a team should equal the total of that team's [[Run (baseball)|runs]], men [[left on base]], and men put [[Out (baseball)|out]].\n\n==Major League Baseball leaders==\n{{Main|List of Major League Baseball career plate appearance leaders}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Baseball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Plate Appearance}}\n[[Category:Batting statistics]]", "sha1": "ryrwpd8lhd76o3up8n29adf38w8fccu"}}, {"title": "Games played", "ns": "0", "id": "3814", "revision": {"id": "817019322", "parentid": "813405869", "timestamp": "2017-12-25T13:35:35Z", "contributor": {"ip": "85.56.109.5"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Games played''' (most often abbreviated as '''G''' or '''GP''') is a [[statistic]] used in [[team sport]]s to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.\n\n==Baseball==\nIn [[baseball]], the [[baseball statistics|statistic]] applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a [[starting lineup]] card or are announced as ''ex ante'' substitutes, whether or not they play,<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp Section 20 of the official scorer guidelines]</ref> although, in [[Major League Baseball]], the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks.

DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP's debut album, ''[[Criminal Minded]]''. The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the [[South Bronx]] section of [[The Bronx]], one of the five boroughs of [[New York City]]. The group pioneered the fusion of [[dancehall]] reggae and [[hip hop music]] and their debut LP ''Criminal Minded'' contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become [[gangsta rap]].\n\n==Members==\nThe membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being [[KRS-One]]. The group was founded by KRS-One and DJ Scott La Rock, with producer Lee Smith, who was essential in the production of the songs in the group's first album ''Criminal Minded'', being added as a member shortly after.  From those beginnings, BDP members and collaborators included Lee Smith, [[Scott La Rock]], [[D-Nice]], Kenny Parker (younger brother of KRS-One), Just-Ice, ICU, McBoo, [[Ms. Melodie]], [[Heather B.]], Scottie Morris, Tony Rahsan, Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, [[DJ Red Alert]], Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name. Original member Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12\u201d \"South Bronx\" single, was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott's death.\n\nIn the liner notes on BDP's 1992 album ''Sex and Violence'', KRS-One writes: \"BDP in 1992 is KRS-One, Willie D, and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie, and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin'.\" Steve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews.com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group.<ref>Juon, Steve. [http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_sexandviolence.html \"''Sex and Violence'' Review\"], September 22, 2008.</ref> See Also: [[KRS-One]], [[Scott La Rock]], and [[D-Nice]]\n\n==Cultural influences and impact==\n===\"The Bridge Wars\"===\n\nA conflict arose in the late 1980s about the origins of hip-hop, and BDP made conscious efforts in its early work to establish their interpretation of the issue. The origins of hip-hop to many, including BDP, are believed to be from [[the Bronx]]. A rival [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] collective known as the [[Juice Crew]]'s lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song \"The Bridge\" that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]]. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs such as \u201cThe Bridge is Over\u201d and \u201cSouth Bronx,\u201d which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as [[MC Shan]], [[Marley Marl]], [[Roxanne Shant\u00e9]] and [[Blaq Poet]] all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived, and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on socially conscious music.\n\nWhile ''Criminal Minded'' contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott's death. Producer Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted the Teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious Hip-Hop. BDP was influential in provoking political and social consciousness in Hip-Hop however the group was sometimes overshadowed by the political hip hop group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].\n\n===Jamaican inspirations===\n\nThe Jamaican influence present in ''Criminal Minded'' is well illustrated by the use of the \"Mad Mad\" or \"Diseases\" [[riddim]] started in 1981 with reggae star [[Yellowman]]'s song \"Zunguzung.\" BDP used this riff in the song \"Remix for P is Free,\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJeThDfdzk YouTube: Remix For P Is Free\u2014Boogie Down Productions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and it was later resampled by artists such as [[Black Star (group)|Black Star]] and [[dead prez]]. As an album regarded by many as the start of the [[gangsta rap]] movement, ''Criminal Minded'' played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture.<ref>Marshall, Wayne. [http://wayneandwax.com/?p=137 \"Follow Me Now: The Zigzagging Zunguzung Meme\"], May 10, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Political and social activism==\nFrom its start, BDP was impactful in both the development of hip-hop and giving a sincere voice to the reality of life in the South Bronx, a section of New York City that is clouded with poverty and crime. With its debut album ''Criminal Minded'', this early hip-hop group combined the sounds of LaRock's harsh, spare, reggae-influenced beats and KRS-One's long-winded rhyme style on underground classics such as \u201c9mm Goes Bang\u201d and \u201cSouth Bronx,\u201d the album's gritty portrait of life on the streets (as well as the firearms that adorned its cover) influenced the [[gangsta rap]] movement that began in earnest two years later.<ref>[http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0002/e2252?hi=0&highlight=1&from=quick&pos=1# Africana]</ref>\n\nThe influence of BDP in the creation and development of gangsta rap highlights the cultural significance and impact of the type of music BDP and other early hip-hop artists like it created. This subgenre of hip-hop is most closely associated with hard-core hip-hop and is widely misinterpreted as promoting violence and gang activity. This misinterpretation or stigma is closely related to Boogie Down Productions and the general purpose behind their underlying themes of violence. For instance, the cover art of ''Criminal Minded'' displays the two artists in this group brandishing drawn guns and displaying other firearms. This is not an encouragement of the violence described in BDP's music, but rather a portrayal or hinting at the violence present in the South Bronx as a means of expression, escape, and even condemnation. This album art is not meant to advocate for violence but to challenge the conception of a criminal, to assert that those who are really criminally minded are those who hold power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  This conflicts with the general stigma surrounding gangsta rap, which thrives off of displaying messages of violence in such a way that it doesn\u2019t challenge these social ills, but rather supports them through the culture of the music.\n\nThe music of BDP became significantly more politically astute after the death of disc jockey Scott La Rock,<ref name=\"autogenerated1987\">Iverem, Esther. \"Violent Death Halts Rap Musician's Rise.\" The New York Times 31 Aug. 1987: 1. Archives. Web. 15 Sept. 2014.</ref> KRS-One's mentor and partner. La Rock's death symbolized all of the injustices that BDP reacted to and lyrically described in their music, and thus inspired KRS-One, now the only original member left in the group, to become more passionate about the relevance of the message of BDP's music. He went on to publish four more albums under the title of Boogie Down Productions, and each one was increasingly innovative and expanded from the thuggish imagery of ''Criminal Minded'' and began to explore themes like black-on-black crime, and black radicalism, using a riff on the words of [[Malcolm X]], \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, which became the title of the second BDP album, and still remains as one of the most political hip-hop albums to date.<ref>[http://www.oxfordaasc.com/article/opr/t0002/e2252?hi=0&highlight=1&from=quick&pos=1#]</ref>  It was in this album where KRS defined himself as the \u201cteacha\u201d or \u201cteacher\u201d symbolizing his emphasis on educating his audience members and fans about relevant social issues surrounding the African-American experience.\n\nDuring his time in association with Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One joined with other rappers to create the [[Stop the Violence Movement]], which addressed many of the issues brought about through BDP's music and is the most conscious effort displayed by KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions of political Activism and engagement. The movement created the single \u201cSelf-Destruction\u201d in 1989 through the collaboration of hip-hop artists Boogie Down Productions (KRS-One, D-Nice & Ms. Melodie), [[Stetsasonic]] (Delite, Daddy-O, [[Wise (rapper)|Wise]], and [[Frukwan]]), [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Just-Ice]], [[Heavy D]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] ([[Chuck D]] & [[Flavor Flav]]) with the aim of spreading awareness about violence throughout African-American and hip-hop communities.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Nielson, E.. \"\"Can't C Me\": Surveillance and Rap Music.\" Journal of Black Studies 40.6 (2010): 1254-1274.

BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetics and a slightly less dense storage.\n\nBCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the [[IBM System/360]] series and its descendants, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAX]] and the Motorola [[68000]]-series processors. Although BCD ''per se'' is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]]; [[x86]] does not support [[Intel BCD opcode|its BCD instruction]]s in [[long mode]] any more), decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[rounding]] [[round-off error|errors]] that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.<ref name=\"Cowlishaw_GDA\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Unpacked BCD|NBCD|8-4-2-1}}Basics==\nBCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is \"natural BCD\" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called \"8421\" encoding.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Decimal digit\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | BCD\n|-\n! 8 !! 4 !! 2 !! 1\n|-\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| 6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| 7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1\n|}\n\nOther encodings are also used, including so-called \"4221\" and \"7421\"\u2014named after the weighting used for the bits\u2014and \"[[Excess-3]]\".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Parag K. |author-first=Lala |title=Principles of Modern Digital Design |date=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-470-07296-7 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doNGOrHUyCoC&lpg=PA20}}</ref> For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.\n\nAs most computers deal with data in 8-bit [[byte]]s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:\n* '''Unpacked''': Each numeral is encoded into one byte, with four bits representing the numeral and the remaining bits having no significance.\n* '''Packed''': Two numerals are encoded into a single byte, with one numeral in the least significant [[nibble]] (bits 0 through 3) and the other numeral in the most significant nibble (bits 4 through 7).\n\nAs an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>'''91'''</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:\n  Decimal:          9          1\n  Binary :  0000 1001  0000 0001\n\nIn packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:\n  Decimal:     9    1\n  Binary :  1001 0001\n\nHence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.\n\nTo represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used. For example, to represent the decimal number <tt>'''12345'''</tt> in packed BCD, using [[big-endian]] format, a program would encode as follows:\n  Decimal:          1     2    3     4    5\n  Binary :  0000 0001  0010 0011  0100 0101\n\nNote that the most significant nibble of the most significant byte is zero, implying that the number is in actuality <tt>'''012345'''</tt>. Also note how packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage as compared to unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.\n\n[[logical shift|Shifting]] and [[mask (computing)|masking]] operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit. Other [[bitwise operation|logical operation]]s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.\n\n==BCD in electronics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}{{Primary sources|section|date=January 2018}}\n\nBCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware\u2014a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.\n\nThe same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.<ref>{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Packed BCD==\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\nIn '''packed BCD''' (or simply '''packed decimal'''), each of the two [[nibble]]s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are [[big endian]], i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.\n\nStandard sign values are 1100 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (\u2212). This convention comes from the zone field for [[EBCDIC]] characters and the [[signed overpunch]] representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F).<ref name=\"IBM_POP\">{{citation |title=IBM System/370 Principles of Operation |chapter=Chapter 8: Decimal Instructions |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=March 1980 }}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_PDP11\">{{citation |title=PDP-11 Architecture Handbook |chapter=Chapter 3: Data Representation |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1983}}</ref><ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\">{{citation |title=VAX-11 Architecture Handbook |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |year=1985}}</ref> ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/iseries/v5r2/ic2924/books/c0925083170.htm |title=ILE RPG Reference}}</ref> These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and \u2212127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\" width=\"20%\"|Sign<br>Digit\n! bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\" width=\"20%\"|BCD<br>8&nbsp;4&nbsp;2&nbsp;1\n! bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\" width=\"20%\"|Sign\n! bgcolor=\"#E0E0E0\" width=\"40%\"|Notes\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |A\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |B\n| 1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |C\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| Preferred\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |D\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1\n| '''\u2212'''\n| Preferred\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |E\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0\n| '''+'''\n| &nbsp;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#F0F0F0\" |F\n| 1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;1\n| '''+'''\n| Unsigned\n|-\n|}\n\nNo matter how many bytes wide a [[Word (data type)|word]] is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of ''n'' bytes can contain up to (2''n'')\u22121 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with ''d'' digits requires {{sfrac|1|2}}(''d''+1) bytes of storage space.\n\nFor example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from \u00b19,999,999. Thus the number \u22121,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:\n 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101\n ''1    2    3    4    5    6    7    \u2212''\n\n(Note that, like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal \u2013 with the most significant two digits \u2013 is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the [[endianness]] of the machine.)\n\nIn contrast, a 4-byte binary [[two's complement]] integer can represent values from \u22122,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.\n\nWhile packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about one-sixth of the memory used is wasted), conversion to [[ASCII]], [[EBCDIC]], or the various encodings of [[Unicode]] is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of [[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]] exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.\n\nPacked BCD is supported in the [[COBOL]] programming language as the \"COMPUTATIONAL-3\" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or \"PACKED-DECIMAL\" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in [[PL/I]] as \"FIXED DECIMAL\". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original [[VAX]] processors from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] and some models of the [[SDS Sigma series]] mainframes, and is the native format for the [[Burroughs Corporation]] Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s [[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 200 series]]).\n\n[[Ten's complement]] representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for, a 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from \u221250,000,000 to +49,999,999, and \u22121 is represented as 99999999. (As with [[two's complement]] binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)\n\n===Fixed-point packed decimal===\n[[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:\n 12 34 56 7C\n ''12 34.56 7+''\n\nThe decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.\n\n===Higher-density encodings===\nIf a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is greater than 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are ''[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]'' and ''[[densely packed decimal]]'' (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.\n\n=={{anchor|Zoned BCD}}Zoned decimal==\nSome implementations, for example [[IBM]] mainframe systems, support '''zoned decimal''' numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the \"zone\" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the [[EBCDIC]] codes for the characters \"0\" through \"9\". Similarly, [[ASCII]] systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).\n\nFor signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value \u2212123:\n F1 F2 D3\n '' 1  2 \u22123''\n\n===EBCDIC zoned decimal conversion table===\n<!-- Note that this table should also include codes A0-A9, B0-B9, and E0-E9 for completeness. -->\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:\n F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0\n '' 1  2  7  9. 5 +0''\n\n{{Anchor|IBMBCD}}<!--- keep anchor with following section, \"IBM and BCD\" --->\n\n==IBM and BCD==\n{{Main article|BCDIC}}\n[[IBM]] used the terms ''[[Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code]]'' (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit ''[[alphanumeric]]'' codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC ''alphamerics'' is used in most early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 1620]], [[IBM 1400 series]], and non-[[IBM 700/7000 series#Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)|Decimal Architecture]] members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]].\n\nThe [[IBM 1400 series]] are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled ''B, A, 8, 4, 2'' and ''1,'' plus an odd parity check bit (''C'') and a word mark bit (''M''). For encoding digits ''1'' through ''9'', ''B'' and ''A'' are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits ''8'' through ''1''. For most other characters bits ''B'' and ''A'' are derived simply from the \"12\", \"11\", and \"0\" \"zone punches\" in the punched card character code, and bits ''8'' through ''1'' from the ''1'' through ''9'' punches. A \"12 zone\" punch set both ''B'' and ''A'', an \"11 zone\" set ''B'', and a \"0 zone\" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set ''A''. Thus the letter '''A''', which is ''(12,1)'' in the punched card format, is encoded ''(B,A,1)''. The currency symbol '''$''', ''(11,8,3)'' in the punched card, was encoded in memory as ''(B,8,2,1)''. This allows the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit ''0'', represented by a lone ''0'' punch in the card, and ''(8,2)'' in core memory.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Van1401-CodeChart.pdf IBM BM 1401/1440/1460/1410/7010 Character Code Chart in BCD Order]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe memory of the [[IBM 1620]] is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual ''8, 4, 2, 1'' plus ''F'', used as a flag bit and ''C'', an odd parity check bit. BCD ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs, with the \"zone\" in the even-addressed digit and the \"digit\" in the odd-addressed digit, the \"zone\" being related to the ''12'', ''11'', and ''0'' \"zone punches\" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nIn the Decimal Architecture [[IBM 7070]], [[IBM 7072]], and [[IBM 7074]] ''alphamerics'' are encoded using digit pairs (using [[two-out-of-five code]] in the digits, '''not''' BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the \"zone\" in the left digit and the \"digit\" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.\n\nWith the introduction of [[System/360]], IBM expanded 6-bit BCD ''alphamerics'' to 8-bit [[EBCDIC]], allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD ''numeric'' data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.\n\nOn the [[IBM 1130]] and [[IBM 1800|1800]], packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.\n\nToday, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as [[IBM DB2]], mainframes, and [[Power6]]. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per [[byte]]), or \"pure\" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the JCL utility DFSORT.<ref>http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r12/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.zos.r12.iceg200%2Fenf.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Other computers and BCD==\nThe [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX|VAX-11]] series includes [[Instruction set|instructions]] that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations.<ref name=\"DEC_VAX11\"/> The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.\n\nThe [[Intel]] [[x86]] architecture supports a [[Intel BCD opcode|unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format]] that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture|page=4-9|date=December 2016|publisher=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motorola 68000 series]] had BCD instructions.<ref name=\"m68k\">url=http://www.tigernt.com/onlineDoc/68000.pdf</ref>\n\nIn more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Jones_AT\">{{cite web |title=BCD Arithmetic, a tutorial |work=Arithmetic Tutorials |author-first=Douglas W. |author-last=Jones |author-link=Douglas W.

Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 \u2013 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:\n 1001 + 1000 = 10001\n    9 +    8 =    17\n\nNote that 10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result. Also note that it cannot fit in a 4-bit number. In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to that sum and then the result is treated as two [[nibble]]s:\n 10001 + 0110 = 00010111 => 0001 0111\n    17 +    6 =       23       1    7\n\nThe two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits \"1\" and \"7\". This yields \"17\" in BCD, which is the correct result.\n\nThis technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a [[half-carry flag]] to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.\n\n==Subtraction with BCD==\nSubtraction is done by adding the [[ten's complement]] of the [[subtrahend]]. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a [[positive number]], and 1001 is used to represent a [[negative number]]. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 \u2212 432.\n\nIn signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The [[ten's complement]] of 432 can be obtained by taking the [[nine's complement]] of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 \u2212 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number \u2212432 can be represented. So, \u2212432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.\n\nNow that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:\n   0000 0011 0101 0111\n      0    3    5    7\n + 1001 0101 0110 1000\n <u>     9    5    6    8</u>\n = 1001 1000 1011 1111\n      9    8   11   15\n\nSince BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2<sup>4</sup> = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:\n   1001 1000 1011 1111\n      9    8   11   15\n + 0000 0000 0110 0110\n <u>     0    0    6    6</u>\n = 1001 1001 0010 0101\n      9    9    2    5\n\nThus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (\u2212925). To check the answer, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 \u2212 432 should result in a negative number. To check the rest of the digits, represent them in decimal. 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The [[ten's complement]] of 925 is 1000 \u2212 925 = 999 \u2212 925 + 1 = 074 + 1 = 75, so the calculated answer is \u221275. To check, perform standard subtraction to verify that 357 \u2212 432 is \u221275.\n\nNote that in the event that there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 \u2212 122), the number with the fewest  digits must first be padded with zeros before taking the [[ten's complement]] or subtracting. So, with 1053 \u2212 122, 122 would have to first be represented as 0122, and the [[ten's complement]] of 0122 would have to be calculated.\n\n==Background==\nThe binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as ''Simple Binary-Coded Decimal'' (''SBCD'') or ''BCD&nbsp;8421''.\n<!-- It is also sometimes named ''NBCD'' (''Naturally Binary-Coded Decimal'').

Benson]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.\n\n==Comparison with pure binary==\n<!-- not at all clear why this needs to be here at all, shouldn't the article just describe BCD? (mfc)-->\n<!--as an alternative number system for computing and electronics imo a comparison to the standard one is justified (plugwash)-->\n\n===Advantages===\n* Many non-integral values, such as decimal 0.2, have an infinite place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) but have a finite place-value in binary-coded decimal (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded decimal representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.\n* Scaling by a factor of 10 (or a power of 10) is simple; this is useful when a decimal scaling factor is needed to represent a non-integer quantity (e.g., in financial calculations)\n* [[Rounding]] at a decimal digit boundary is simpler. Addition and subtraction in decimal does not require rounding.\n* Alignment of two decimal numbers (for example 1.3 + 27.08) is a simple, exact, shift.\n* Conversion to a character form or for display (e.g., to a text-based format such as [[XML]], or to drive signals for a [[seven-segment display]]) is a simple per-digit mapping, and can be done in linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) time. Conversion from pure [[binary numeral system|binary]] involves relatively complex logic that spans digits, and for large numbers no linear-time conversion algorithm is known (see [[Binary numeral system#Conversion to and from other numeral systems|Binary numeral system]]).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Some operations are more complex to implement. [[Adder (electronics)|Adder]]s require extra logic to cause them to wrap and generate a carry early. 15\u201320 percent more circuitry is needed for BCD add compared to pure binary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Multiplication requires the use of algorithms that are somewhat more complex than shift-mask-add (a [[Binary numeral system#Multiplication|binary multiplication]], requiring binary shifts and adds or the equivalent, per-digit or group of digits is required)\n* Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log<sub>2</sub>10 bits is 1.204). When packed so that three digits are encoded in ten bits, the storage overhead is greatly reduced, at the expense of an encoding that is unaligned with the 8-bit byte boundaries common on existing hardware, resulting in slower implementations on these systems.<!-- Could add: encoding or decoding is trivial in software using a table lookup, and fast using direct logic otherwise. In hardware it requires no more than three gate delays. -->\n* Practical existing implementations of BCD are typically slower than operations on binary representations, especially on embedded systems,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to limited processor support for native BCD operations.\n\n==Application==\nThe [[BIOS]] in many [[personal computer]]s stores the date and time in BCD because the [[MC6818]] real-time clock chip used in the original [[IBM PC AT]] motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.<ref>http://www.se.ecu.edu.au/units/ens1242/lectures/ens_Notes_08.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- also see MC6818 datasheet -->\n\nThe [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The [[Psion Organiser|Psion Organiser 1]] handheld computer\u2019s manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.\n\nEarly models of the [[PlayStation 3]] store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD [[time formatting and storage bugs|were misinterpreted]] as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the [[Year 2000 problem#Year 2010 problem|Year 2010 Problem]].\n\n==Representational variations==\nVarious BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. [[Programmable calculator]]s manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others typically employ a [[floating-point]] BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as [[infinity]], [[arithmetic underflow|underflow]]/[[arithmetic overflow|overflow]], and [[Defined and undefined|error]] (a blinking display).\n\n===Signed variations===\nSigned decimal values may be represented in several ways. The [[COBOL]] programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:25%\"| Type\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:55%\"| Description\n! style=\"background:#D0E0FF; width:20%\"| Example\n|-\n| Unsigned\n| No sign nibble\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>F</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing ''(canonical format)''\n| Sign nibble in the last (least significant) byte\n| <code>F1 F2 <u>C</u>3</code>\n|-\n| Signed leading ''(overpunch)''\n| Sign nibble in the first (most significant) byte\n| <code><u>C</u>1 F2 F3</code>\n|-\n| Signed trailing separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) following the digit bytes\n| <code>F1 F2 F3 <u>2B</u></code>\n|-\n| Signed leading separate\n| Separate sign character byte (<code>'+'</code> or <code>'\u2212'</code>) preceding the digit bytes\n| <code><u>2B</u> F1 F2 F3</code>\n|}\n\n==={{anchor|TBCD}}Telephony Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD)===\n[[3GPP]] developed '''TBCD''',<ref>{{cite techreport |title=3GPP TS 29.002: Mobile Application Part (MAP) specification |at=sec. 17.7.8 Common data types |year=2013 |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/29002.htm}}</ref> an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific [[telephony]] characters,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_etr/001_099/060/02_60/etr_060e02p.pdf |title=Signalling Protocols and Switching (SPS) Guidelines for using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) in telecommunication application protocols |page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openss7.org/specs/xmap.pdf |title=XOM Mobile Application Part (XMAP) Specification |page=93}}</ref> with digits similar to those found in [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|telephone keypads]] original design.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |Decimal<br/>Digit\n! style=\"background:#E0E0E0; width:50%\" |TBCD<br/>8 4 2 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |*\n| 1 0 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |#\n| 1 0 1 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |a\n| 1 1 0 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |b\n| 1 1 0 1\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |c\n| 1 1 1 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0F0F0\" |Used as filler when there is an odd number of digits\n| 1 1 1 1\n|-\n|}\n\nThe mentioned 3GPP document defines '''TBCD-STRING''' with swapped nibbles in each byte.

For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2{{e|-1}}.\n\nThis representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment\u2014particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of [[fixed point arithmetic]] since the position of the [[radix point]] is implied.\n\n[[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]] provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD) is a similar scheme that is used for most of the [[significand]], except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bi-quinary coded decimal]]\n* [[Binary integer decimal]] (BID)\n* [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding]]\n* [[Densely packed decimal]] (DPD)\n* [[Double dabble]], an algorithm for converting binary numbers to BCD\n* [[Gray code]]\n* [[Year 2000 problem]]\n* [[Decimal computer]]\n* [[Binary-coded ternary]] (BCT)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Pseudo-tetrades\">That is, in a standard packed 4-bit representation, there are 16 states (four bits for each digit) with 10 tetrades and 6 pseudo-tetrades, whereas in more densely packed schemes such as [[Chen\u2013Ho encoding|Chen\u2013Ho]] or [[densely packed decimal|DPD]] coding there are less, f.e. only 24 pseudo-tetrades in 1024 states (10 bits for three digits).</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Intel_IA32\">{{cite web |author=Intel |title=ia32 architecture manual |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developers-manual.pdf |publisher=[[Intel]] |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Schneider_1986\">{{cite book |title=Lexikon der Informatik und Datenverarbeitung |language=German |author-first=Hans-Jochen |author-last=Schneider |date=1986 |edition=2 |publisher=R.

He campaigned alongside his father from early years as a child. He was created as Tardush shad and given command over western wing of empire in 697 by [[Qapaghan Qaghan|Qapaghan]]. He managed to annihalate [[Wei Yuanzhong]]'s army in 701 with his brother. He also reconquered [[Basmyl]] tribes in 703. He also subdued [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]] forces in 709, after their disobedience had to reconquer and kill their khagan in 710. He killed Sakal in his invasion of [[Turgesh]] in 711 and had submission from [[Beshbalik|Beshbaliq]] in 713.\n\nIn later years of [[Qapaghan Qaghan|Qapaghan]], he had to fight 4 battles in a year starting from 714, resubduing tribes and nearly was killed in an ambush from [[Huige]] forces in 715.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33892575|title=G\u00f6k-T\u00fcrkler|last=Ahmet.|first=Ta\u015fa\u011fil,|date=1995|publisher=T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu Bas\u0131mevi|others=Atat\u00fcrk K\u00fclt\u00fcr, Dil, ve Tarih Y\u00fcksek Kurumu (Turkey)|year=|isbn=975161113X|location=Ankara|pages=|oclc=33892575}}</ref>\n\n==Reign==\nIn 716, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]], the second khagan, was killed in his campaign against the [[Toquz Oghuz]] alliance and his severed head was sent to [[Chang'an]].<ref name=\"Tang194\">''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u5377194\u4e0a|Vol. 194-I]]</ref> Although his son [[Inel Khagan]] succeeded him, Bilge's brother [[Kul Tigin]] and [[Tonyukuk]] carried out a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Inel Khaghan. They killed him and made him ''Bilge'' ''khagan''.<ref name=\"Tang194\" /> His name literally means \"wise king\".\n\nHe appointed his brother [[Kul Tigin]] to be Left Wise Prince, which made second most powerful person in realm. He resubdued [[Huige]] in 716. Also appointed his father-in-law [[Tonyukuk]] to be Master Strategist.\n\nNew reforms and stabilization of regime caused tribes that fled Tujue to come back. Tang chancellor [[Wang Jun (Tang chancellor)|Wang Jun]], believing that the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks who surrendered would try to flee back to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so. Before Wang's suggestion could be acted upon, however, there was an uprising by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks who surrendered, under the leadership of Xiedie Sitai (\ud860\udc42\u8dcc\u601d\u6cf0) and Axilan (\u963f\u6089\u721b). [[Xue Ne|Xue]] and Wang tried to intercept them and dealt them defeats, but they were able to flee back to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk state anyway. This defeat led to Xue Ne's retirement.\n\n== Religious policy ==\nAt some point in his life, he wanted to convert to [[Buddhism]], settle in cities. However, [[Tonyukuk]] discouraged him from this, citing Tujue's small numbers and vulnerability to Chinese attack. While Turks' power rested on their mobility, conversion to Buddhism would bring pacifism among population. Therefore, sticking to [[Tengrism|Tengriism]] was necessary to survive.<ref>''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'', 2693a</ref><ref>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%94%90%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7215%E4%B8%8B vol 215-II]</ref><ref name=\"Tang194\" />\n\n== Later reign ==\n[[File:Bilge_Khagan_monument_Mongolia.JPG|thumb|The Bilge Khagan monument with inscriptions, Mongolia|369x369px]]In 720, Wang believed that the Pugu (\u50d5\u56fa) and Xiedie tribes of the region were planning to defect to Eastern Tujue and attack with Eastern Tujue troops. He thus held a feast and invited the chieftains, and, at the feast, massacred them. He then attacked the Pugu and Xiedie tribes in the area, nearly wiping them out.

Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a \"total\" work of art ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]] and art, design and architectural education.<ref name=\"archdic\">{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-051323-X |pages=880}}</ref> The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, [[industrial design]], and [[typography]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bauhaus Movemen |url=http://www.bauhaus-movement.com/en/ |website=Rethinking the world Art and Technology \u2013 A new Unity}}</ref>\n\nThe school existed in three German cities: [[Weimar]] from 1919 to 1925, [[Dessau]] from 1925 to 1932, and [[Berlin]] from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: [[Walter Gropius]] from 1919 to 1928, [[Hannes Meyer]] from 1928 to 1930, and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism.

For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.\n\n==Bauhaus and German modernism==\n[[File:\u05de\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e11.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Bauhaus Museum, Tel Aviv]]]]\n{{details|New Objectivity (architecture)}}\nGermany's defeat in [[World War I]], the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]] and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal [[Weimar Republic]] allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.<ref>Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416</ref> Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer [[William Morris]], who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.<ref>''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348</ref> Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.\n\nHowever, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus\u2014the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that [[mass production]] was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit\u2014were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).\n\n[[File:Bauhaus Chemnitz hb.JPG|right|thumb|Bauhaus building in [[Chemnitz]]]]\nThe entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] worked for him in this period.\n\nThe Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] had turned from emotional [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a \"minimal dwelling\" written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.\n\n===Bauhaus and Vkhutemas===\n{{Main article|Vkhutemas}}\nThe Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]], has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope.

In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.\n\n==History of the Bauhaus==\n===Weimar===\nThe school was founded by Walter Gropius in [[Weimar]] in 1919, as a merger of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the [[William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in 1906, and directed by Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Henry van de Velde]].<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |page=44}}</ref> When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[August Endell]] as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of [[World War I]] and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the [[fine art]]s and the [[applied art]]s (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus.<ref name=\"Frampton 1992 124\">{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |year=1992 |edition=3rd ed. rev. |publisher=Thames and Hudson, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-20257-5 |page=124 |chapter=The Bauhaus: Evolution of an Idea 1919\u201332}}</ref> In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled ''Exhibition of Unknown Architects'', Gropius proclaimed his goal as being \"to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist.\" Gropius' [[neologism]] ''Bauhaus'' references both building and the Bauh\u00fctte, a [[premodern]] [[guild]] of stonemasons.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Whitford, Frank |title=The Bauhaus: Masters & Students by Themselves |year=1992 |publisher=Conran Octopus |location=London |isbn=1-85029-415-1 |page=32 |quote=He invented the name 'Bauhaus' not only because it specifically referred to bauen ('building', 'construction')\u2014but also because of its similarity to the word Bauh\u00fctte, the medieval guild of builders and stonemasons out of which Freemasonry sprang.

Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote ''[[De Stijl]]'' (\"The Style\"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].<ref name=\"foster\">{{cite book |editor=Hal Foster |others=Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin Buchloh |title=Art Since 1900: Volume 1\u20141900 to 1944|year=2004 |publisher=Thames & Hudson |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-28534-9 |pages=185\u2013189 |chapter=1923: The Bauhaus \u2026 holds its first public exhibition in Weimar, Germany}}</ref>\n[[File:Bauhaus weimar.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]] (built 1904\u20131911; designed by [[Henry van de Velde]] to house the sculptors\u2019 studio at the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School; designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996)]]\n[[File:Weimarbauhaus6.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the Bauhaus-University Weimar, with [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] staircase]]\nFrom 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or \"preliminary course\" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.<ref name=\"Frampton 1992 124\" /> Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Ci\u017eek]] and [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]], as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of German [[Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of Der Blaue Reiter founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.<ref name=\"foster\" />\n\nGropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this \"new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery\", described \"painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future.\" By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the \"[[V\u00f6lkisch movement]]\", instead declaring \"we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=1987 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |pages=309\u2013316 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}</ref> Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''Bauhaus'' and a series of books called \"Bauhausb\u00fccher\". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Bauhaus, 1919\u20131933 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm |website=The MET |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bauhaus |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWeimar was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental [[Haus am Horn]].<ref>Ackermann et al., Bauhaus (Cologne: K\u00f6nemann, 1999), 406.</ref> The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half.

According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.\n\nMeyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,<ref name=\"Artists 2009 pp. 64-66\"/> and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.\n\nBut Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930.<ref name=\"Etlin2002\">{{cite book |author=Richard A.

Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant [[Lilly Reich]]. By 1931, the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]  (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.<ref name=\"Mies\">{{cite book |author=David Spaeth |title=Ludwig Mies van der Rohe |year=1985 |publisher=Rizzoli New York |isbn=0-8478-0563-8 |pages=87\u201393}}<!--|accessdate=15 June 2012--></ref>\n\n===Berlin===\nIn late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the [[Gestapo]] closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school {{when|date=July 2017}}.<ref name=\"Mies\"/>\n\nAlthough neither the Nazi Party nor [[Adolf Hitler]] had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labeled the Bauhaus \"un-German\" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the [[Soviet Union]] when he was fired in 1930.\n\nEven before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its \"[[degenerate art]]\", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of \"cosmopolitan modernism\".<ref name=\"Artists 2009 pp. 64-66\"/> Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the \"New Bauhaus\" of Chicago:<ref>Jardi, Enric (1991) ''Paul Klee''. Rizzoli Intl Pubns, p. 22</ref> Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) in Chicago and to seek building commissions.{{Ref label|fn_1|a|a}} The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in [[Nazi Germany]]. When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]] (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were \"bold examples of modernism\"\u2014among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.<ref>Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325</ref>\n\n==Architectural output==\nThe paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bauhausmanifesto.com |title= Manifesto of the Staatliches Bauhaus |author=Gropius, Walter |date=April 1919 |work=BauhausManifesto.com}}</ref> the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919\u20131927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.\n\nIn the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed \"Laubengangh\u00e4user\" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.\n\n[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's \"study of essentials\", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a \"spatial implementation of intellectual decisions\", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.\n\nThe popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the T\u00f6rten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of Berlin, [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms H\u00fctte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms H\u00fctte]], is still occupied.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Bauhaus-Dessau Festsaal.jpg|A stage in the Festsaal, Dessau\nFile:Bauhaus-Dessau Festsaal B\u00fchnenbeleuchtung.jpg|Ceiling with light fixtures for stage in the Festsaal, Dessau\nFile:Bauhaus-Dessau Wohnheim Balkone.jpg|Dormitory balconies in the residence, Dessau\nFile:Bauhaus-Dessau Fensterfront.JPG|Mechanically opened windows, Dessau\nFile:Mensa Bauhaus Dessau.PNG|The Mensa (Cafeteria), Dessau\n</gallery>\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Olivetti-schawinsky-bauhaus-typewriter.jpg|thumb|Typewriter ''Olivetti Studio 42'' designed by the Bauhaus-alumnus [[Xanti Schawinsky]] in 1936]]\nThe Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and [[Israel]] in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime.

Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.\n\nIn the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung\u2014HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the \"Ulm Model\" concept continues to influence international design education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|title=HfG-Archiv Ulm - The HfG Ulm|first=Ulmer Museum/HfG-Archiv|last=Ulm|website=www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus ''Vorkurs'' (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes.<ref>Bayer, H., Gropius, W., & Gropius, I. (Eds.). (1975). ''Bauhaus 1919\u20131928''. London: Secker& Warburg.</ref><ref name=\"Itten 1963\">Itten, J. (1963). ''Design and Form: The Basic Course at the Bauhaus and Later'' (Revised edition, 1975). New York: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the ''Vorkurs'' and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that \"A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove\".<ref>O'Connor, Z. (2013). \"The Shillito Design School: Australia's link with the Bauhaus\". ''The International Journal of Design in Society'', 6(3), 149\u2013159.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The ubiquitous [[Cantilever chair]] and the [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.\n\nThe physical plant at Dessau survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausb\u00fchne'' (\"Bauhaus Stage\"). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/|title=Bauhaus Dessau|publisher=}}</ref> In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.\n\nLater evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of \"\u2026 the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature\u2026Home hygiene without home atmosphere.\"<ref>Schjeldahl, Peter, \"Bauhaus Rules,\" ''The New Yorker'', November 16, 2009</ref>\n\n===The White City===\nThe [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4}}, ''Ha-Ir HaLevana'') refers to a collection of over 4,000 Bauhaus or [[International style (architecture)|International style]] buildings built in [[Tel Aviv]] from the 1930s by [[German Jewish]] architects who emigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] after the rise of the [[Nazis]].

It may be the oldest surviving long story in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of [[Old English literature]].

[[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]], comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose [[mead hall]] in [[Heorot]] has been under attack by a monster known as [[Grendel]]. After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland ([[G\u00f6taland]] in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.\n\nThe full story survives in the manuscript known as the [[Nowell Codex]]. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist.{{Sfn|Robinson|2001|ps=: 'Like most Old English stories, Beowulf has no title in the unique manuscript in which it survives (British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.xv, which was copied round the year 1000 AD), but modern scholars agree in naming it after the hero whose life is its subject'.}} In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through [[Ashburnham House]] in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]].{{Sfn|Mitchell|Robinson|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=uujn741w2Y4C&pg=PA6 6]}} The Nowell Codex is currently housed in the [[British Library]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Beowulf geography names.png|left|thumb|Approximate central regions of tribes mentioned in ''Beowulf'', with the location of the [[Angles]] in [[Angeln]].

He attacks the dragon with the help of his ''[[thegn]]s'' or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at [[Earnaness|Earnan\u00e6s]], but only his young Swedish relative [[Wiglaf]], whose name means \"remnant of valour\",{{refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|\"w\u00edg\" means \"fight, battle, war, conflict\"<ref>{{cite web |title=W\u00edg |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035625 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> and \"l\u00e1f\" means \"remnant, left-over\"<ref>{{cite web |title=L\u00e1f |url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/021034 |website=Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>}} dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\n\n''Beowulf'' is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins ''[[in medias res]]'' or simply, \"in the middle of things,\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. What is unique about \"Beowulf\" is that the poem actually begins and ends with a funeral. At the beginning of the poem, the king, hero, Shield Shiefson dies (26\u201345) and there is a huge funeral for him. At the end of the poem when Beowulf dies, there is also a massive funeral for Beowulf (3140\u20133170).\n\n=== First battle: Grendel ===\n\n''Beowulf'' begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall [[Heorot]] for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife [[Wealh\u00feeow|Wealhtheow]], and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical [[Cain]], is pained by the sounds of joy.<ref>''Beowulf'', 87\u201398</ref> Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\n\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.<ref>''Beowulf'', 199\u2013203</ref>\n\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot.

Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. \"Beowulf was elsewhere.

[[Unfer\u00f0|Unferth]], a warrior who had doubted him and wishes to make amends, presents Beowulf with his sword [[Hrunting]]. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, at the bottom of which he finds a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed. Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\n\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, puts it aside in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour. Beowulf takes another sword from Grendel's mother and slices her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head. The blade of Beowulf's sword touches Grendel's toxic blood, and instantly dissolves so that only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait in growing despair.  Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot.  Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword [[N\u00e6gling]], his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \"Hrothgar's sermon\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his [[thegn]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Hansen |first1=E.

One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a [[slave]] steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan\u00e6s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (''Beowulf'' lines 2712\u20133182).<ref>{{Citation |title=Beowulf |format=[[Portable document format|PDF]] |publisher=MU |place=SA |url=http://faculty.mu.edu.sa/public/uploads/1348946962.7014beowulf.pdf}}.</ref>\n\n== Authorship and date ==\n''Beowulf'' was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has attracted considerable scholarly attention.

The ''Beowulf'' manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar [[Laurence Nowell]]. The official designation is \"[[British Library]], Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" because it was one of [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Bruce Cotton]]'s holdings in the [[Cotton library]] in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own [[library classification]] systems. \"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor [[Vitellius]] standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a [[tutor]] to his ward, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiernan|first=Kevin S.|title=Speculum|journal=Speculum |volume=73 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=879\u2013881 |jstor=2887546|doi=10.2307/2887546}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)]].<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\">{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Kevin|title=Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript|date=1981|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick |edition=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv8cnwEACAAJ |accessdate=October 6, 2017|isbn=9780472084128}}</ref>{{rp|91}} The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.<ref name=\"Beowulf and the Beowulf Manuscript\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe Reverend [[Thomas Smith (scholar)|Thomas Smith]] (1638\u20131710) and [[Humfrey Wanley]] (1672\u20131726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=2}} The ''Beowulf'' manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\"{{sfn|Joy|2005|p=24}} Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the ''Beowulf'' manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.{{sfn|Kiernan|1996|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at [[Ashburnham House]] in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss.

The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.<ref name=\"Beowulf: Revised Edition\">{{cite book|last1=Swanton|first1=Michael|title=Beowulf: Revised Edition|date=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0719051463|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ks8nj3BGEQC&dq|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref> While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.<ref>{{cite news |author=Leonard Neidorf |year=2013 |journal=Anglo-Saxon England |volume=42 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9099642&fileId=S0263675113000124 |pages=249\u201369 |title=Scribal errors of proper names in the ''Beowulf'' manuscript |doi=10.1017/s0263675113000124}}</ref> The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him.

''Judith'' was written by the same scribe that completed ''Beowulf'' as evidenced through similar writing style.

Rather, given the implications of the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]] and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\n\nScholarly discussion about ''Beowulf'' in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.<ref name=\"COLORING210-217\">{{Citation|last=Blackburn|first=FA|title=The Christian Coloring of Beowulf|journal=PMLA|volume=12|issue=2|pages=210\u201317|year=1897|doi=10.2307/456133|jstor=456133}}</ref><ref name=\"BENSON193-213\">{{Citation|last=Benson|first=Larry D|title=The Pagan Coloring of Beowulf|work=Old English Poetry: fifteen essays|pages=193\u2013213|year=1967|editor-last=Creed|editor-first=RP|place=Providence, [[Rhode Island]]|publisher=Brown University Press}}</ref> There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one [[Christianity]] and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \"repurposing\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\n\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of [[oral-formulaic composition]], which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', [[Albert Lord]] refers to the work of [[Francis Peabody Magoun]] and others, saying \"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate.

Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History |at=V.24}}</ref>\n\n[[Frederick Klaeber]], among others, argued for a connection between ''Beowulf'' and [[Virgil]] near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation |first=Tom Burns |last=Haber |title=A Comparative Study of the Beowulf and the Aeneid |place=Princeton |year=1931}}</ref> Similarly, in 1971, [[Alistair Campbell (academic)|Alistair Campbell]] stated that the [[apologue]] technique used in ''Beowulf'' is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed ''Beowulf'' could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across [[Virgil]]'s writings.{{sfn|Andersson|1998|pp=140\u201341}}\n\n===Biblical influences===\nIt cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with \"Christian colouring\" added by scribes or as a \"Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour',\" as Margaret E.

Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in ''Beowulf'', and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ''ge''- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ''ge''-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ritchie |last=Girvan |title=Beowulf and the Seventh Century Language and Content |publisher=Methuen & Co |place=New Feller Lane: London EC4 |year=1971 |type=print}}</ref>\n\n== Form and metre ==\nAn Old English poem such as ''Beowulf'' is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used [[alliterative verse]], a form of [[poetry|verse]] in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through [[alliteration|similarity in initial sound]]. In addition, the two halves are divided by a [[caesura]]: \"Oft '''Sc'''yld '''Sc'''efing \\\\ '''sc'''ea\u00feena \u00fereatum\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with [[Systems of scansion#Overview|ictus]] on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEA\u00feena \u00deREATum).\n\nThe poet has a choice of [[epithets]] or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in [[modern English]]. The letter {{angbr|h}}, for example, is always pronounced (''Hro\u00f0gar'': {{IPA-ang|\u02c8hro\u00f0gar|}}), and the digraph {{angbr|cg}} is pronounced {{IPA-ang|d\u0292|}}, as in the word ''edge''. Both {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}} vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|z}}, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern {{angbr|f}} in ''fat'' and {{angbr|s}} in ''sat''. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, {{angbr|\u00fe}}, and eth, {{angbr|\u00f0}} \u2013 representing both pronunciations of modern English {{angbr|th}}, as {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}} in ''thing'' and {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} ''this'' \u2013 are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of {{angbr|f}} and {{angbr|s}}. Both are voiced (as in ''this'') between other voiced sounds: ''o\u00f0er'', ''la\u00feleas'', ''su\u00feern''. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in ''thing''): ''\u00feunor'', ''su\u00f0'', ''so\u00fef\u00e6st''.\n\n[[Kenning]]s are also a significant technique in ''Beowulf''. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \"swan-road\" or the \"whale-road\"; a king might be called a \"ring-giver.\" There are many kennings in ''Beowulf'', and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of [[elision|elided]] [[metaphor]]s.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Greenblatt|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Meyer Howard|editor1-link=Beowulf|title=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|date=2006|publisher=W.

R. R. Tolkien]] argued in ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be [[elegy]].{{Sfn|Tolkien|1997|p=31}}<!--Tolkien wrote (on the 27th of 29 pages of the essay):  Beowulf is not an \"epic,\" not even a magnified \"lay.\" No terms borrowed from Greek or other literatures exactly fit: there is no reason why they should. Though if we must have a term, we should choose rather \"elegy.\" It is an heroic-elegiac poem; and in a sense all its first 3,136 lines are the prelude to a dirge: him tha gegiredan Geata leode ad ofer eorthan unwaclicne [\"the Geatish people then built a pyre on that high ground, no mean thing\"]: one of the most moving ever written.     -->\n\n== Interpretation and criticism ==\nThe history of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism is often said to begin with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],{{sfn|Orchard|2003a|p=7}} author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at [[University of Oxford]], who in his 1936 lecture to the [[British Academy]] criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.{{Sfn|Tolkien|2006|p=7}}{{Citation not found|date=December 2017}} He noted in ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics'' that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem \"is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...\"{{Sfn|Tolkien|1958|p=7}}<!--Tolkien wrote on the 3rd page of the essay:   So far from being a poem so poor that only its accidental historical interest can still recommend it, Beowulf is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content, and is largely independent even of the most important facts (such as the date and identity of Hygelac) that research has discovered. It is indeed a curious fact that it is one of the peculiar poetic virtues of Beowulf that has contributed to its critical misfortunes. The illusion of historical truth and perspective, which has made Beowulf seem such an attractive quarry, is largely a product of art.     -->\n\n=== Paganism and Christianity ===\nIn historical terms, the poem's characters would have been [[Norse religion|Norse pagans]] (the historical events of the poem took place before the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Scandinavia]]), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]] around the 7th century \u2013 both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of [[Germanic paganism]]. ''Beowulf'' thus depicts a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic warrior society]], in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.<ref name=\"Leyerle\">{{cite book |last=Leyerle |first=John |editor-last =Fulk |editor-first=Robert Dennis |title=Interpretations of Beowulf: A Critical Anthology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sU0bTfcIjYC&pg=PA155 |accessdate =17 August 2013|year=1991|publisher=Indiana UP|isbn=978-0-253-20639-8 |pages=146\u201367|chapter=The Interlace Structure of Beowulf}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in ''Beowulf'' to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the ''Beowulf'' poet arguably tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the Poet alludes to paganism as presented in ''Beowulf''. The Poet arguably calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the Poet is referencing their \"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \"impressed\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \"Christian truth\" (181). The relationship between the characters of ''Beowulf'', and the overall message of the Poet, regarding their relationship with God is largely debated among readers and literary critics alike.\n\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the ''Beowulf'' poet interpreted \"Danish myths in Christian form\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of ''Beowulf'' liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as '{{linktext|heathen}}s' rather than as foreigners.\"{{Sfn|North|2006|p=195}} [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Grendel]] are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.<ref>{{Citation |last=Williams |first=David |title=Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1982}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\n{{Quote |That the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \"Father Almighty\" or the \"Wielder of All.\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?<ref name=\"nhum\">{{cite web|last=Yeager |first=Robert F |publisher=National Endowment For The Humanities |accessdate=2 October 2007 |url=http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-03/yeager.html |title=Why Read Beowulf?}}</ref>}}\n\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, [[F.W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[University of Leeds]], claimed that ''Beowulf'' was composed in Yorkshire,<ref>F. W. Moorman, \u2018English Place Names and the Teutonic Sagas,'in Oliver Elton (ed.), ''English Association Essays and Studies,'' vol. 5 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1914) pp. 75ff</ref> but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \"which alone preserves the poem\" originated in the kingdom of the [[Wessex|West Saxons]] \u2013 as it is more commonly known.<ref name=\" Tuso, F. Joseph 1975\">{{Citation |last=Tuso |first=F Joseph |title=Beowulf: The Donaldson Translation Backgrounds and Sources Criticism |publisher=Norton & Co |place=New York |year=1975 |page=97}}</ref> Donaldson wrote that \"the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and&nbsp;... poem reflects a Christian tradition\".<ref>Tuso, \"''Donaldson Translation'',\" 98</ref>\n\n=== Politics and warfare ===\nStanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout ''Beowulf'' emphasise the relative position of [[Thegn|thanes]] to their lord. He argues that the term \"shoulder-companion\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \"arm.\"{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=59}} Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with [[Unfer\u00f0]] (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unfer\u00f0 is described as \"at the king's feet\" (line 499). Unfer\u00f0 is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and \"generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.\"{{Sfn|Greenfield|1989|p=61}}\n\nDaniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or [[feud]]ing.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/book-reviews-tuesday-tome-beowulf/|title=Ending Unending Feuds: The Portent of ''Beowulf''\u2018s Historicization of Violent Conflict|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=3 November 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref> In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the [[Geatish-Swedish wars]]\u2014coming into contrast with the poem's depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File: David Woodard Exploding Beowulf.jpg|thumb|[[David Woodard]] appears as both Beowulf and Grendel in the stage production ''Exploding Beowulf'' (Berlin, 2010)]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Anglo-Saxon England}}\n* [[List of Beowulf characters|List of ''Beowulf'' characters]]\n* [[On Translating Beowulf|On Translating ''Beowulf'']]\n* [[Sutton Hoo helmet#Beowulf|Sutton Hoo helmet \u00a7 ''Beowulf'']]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Sarah |title=Introduction and historical/cultural contexts |publisher=Longman Cultural |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-321-10720-6}}.\n* {{citation |last=Andersson |first=Theodore M. |title=Sources and Analogues |work=A Beowulf Handbook |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E. |editor2-first=John D. |editor2-last=Niles |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=1998 |pages=125\u201348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&pg=PA125 |isbn=9780803261501}}\n* {{Citation |last=Carruthers |first=Leo |chapter=Rewriting Genres: ''Beowulf'' as Epic Romance |title=Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England |editor1-first=Leo |editor1-last=Carruthers |editor2-first=Raeleen |editor2-last=Chai-Elsholz |editor3-first=Tatjana |editor3-last=Silec |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |date=2011 |pages=139\u201355 |isbn=9780230100268}}\n* {{Citation |last=Chadwick |first=Nora K. |author-link=Nora K.

Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |title=Director and Leading Actors |publisher=Getback.com |archive-date=2008-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004054717/http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and is ranked No. 6 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list.\n\nBrooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking Indian chief and \u201ca director\u201d in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]] and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]] and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself.\n\nThe film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American frontier|American West]], with the hero being a [[African Americans|black]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German army]] of [[World War II]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through [[quicksand]]. The conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting a white foreman. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid\", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him; when he visits the railroad work site and discovers their interest in the land, the Waco Kid outshoots Taggart and his thugs; finally, Bart outmaneuvers German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Nazis, and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nThree miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion;  with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"Gov. William J. Le Petomane Throughway\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are boobytrapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the [[fourth wall]], spilling onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which is playing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". They ride off into the sunset on horseback, but stop at a chauffeured [[stretch limousine]] and continue outward in the vehicle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim, the \"Waco Kid\"\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili von Shtupp, the \"Teutonic Titwillow\"\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Buddy Bizarre\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Gov.

Richard Pryor was Brooks' original choice to play the Sheriff Bart, but the studio, claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable, refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star.<ref name=\"salon\"/> Cleavon Little was cast in the role, and Pryor remained as a writer. Brooks offered the other leading role, the Waco Kid, to [[John Wayne]]; he declined, deeming the film \"too [[pornographic movie|blue]]\" for his family-oriented image, but assured Brooks that \"he would be the first one in line to see it.\"<ref>Staff (May 20, 2016) [http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/mel-brooks-on-john-wayne-improv-and-the-presidential-race/zsJpes---t1y4luA8q4ho/ \"Mel Brooks on John Wayne, Improv and the Presidential Race\"] ''Metro Philadelphia''</ref> [[Gig Young]] was cast, but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]], and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him.<ref name=donnelly>{{cite book|last=Donnelly|first=Paul |title=Fade To Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|publisher=Omnibus|year=2005|edition=3|page=746|isbn=1-84449-430-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Parish|first= James Robert |title=It's Good to Be the King: The Seriously Funny Life of Mel Brooks|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2008|page=9|isbn=0-470-22526-2}}</ref> [[Johnny Carson]] and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast.<ref>[[Timothy White (editor)|White, Timothy]] (March 22, 1979) \"Johnny Carson: The ''Rolling Stone'' Interview\" in [[Jann Wenner|Wenner, Jann S.]] ed.

It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included [[Millie Slavin]] and [[Noble Willingham]]. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] and was written by Michael Elias and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eutis later created and executive produced the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'' (1986-1991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said ''Black Bart'' \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on ''[[Barney Miller]]'' by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told ''Entertainment Tonight'', \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air ''Blazing Saddles'', and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make ''Blazing Saddles'' into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing ''Blazing Saddles'' stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to ''Blazing Saddles''. By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the ''Black Bart'' series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another ''Blazing Saddles'', and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. [[Oy gevalt]]! Well, management changed and they never did ''Blazing Saddles 2'', and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of ''Black Bart'' was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref>{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}</ref>\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe first studio-licensed release of the full music soundtrack to ''Blazing Saddles'' was on [[La-La Land Records]] on August 26, 2008.

He won [[Hugo Award]]s for his novelettes ''[[Bicycle Repairman]]'' and ''[[Taklamakan (story)|Taklamakan]]''. His first novel, ''[[Involution Ocean]]'', published in 1977, features the world Nullaqua where all the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is contained in a single, miles-deep [[Impact crater|crater]]. The story concerns a ship sailing on the [[ocean]] of dust at the bottom, which hunts creatures called dustwhales that live beneath the surface. It is partially a science-fictional [[pastiche]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]].\n\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the [[Shaper/Mechanist universe]]: the [[solar system]] is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do [[genetic engineering]] on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[civilization]]s; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that many of these effectively vanish from the [[galaxy]], reminiscent of [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]] in the works of [[Vernor Vinge]]. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection ''Crystal Express'' and the collection ''Schismatrix Plus'', which contains the original novel ''Schismatrix'' and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. [[Alastair Reynolds]] identified ''Schismatrix'' and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/16/bruce-sterling-at-the-innovations-forum/ |title=The World According to Bruce Sterling |publisher=Impact Lab |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Bruce Sterling at ARE 2010.jpg|thumb|Bruce Sterling at the 2010 [[Augmented Reality]] Event]]\n\nIn the 1980s, Sterling edited the science fiction critical fanzine ''[[Cheap Truth]]'' under the alias of Vincent Omniaveritas.

The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a [[head trauma]] or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with [[congenital heart disease]] in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nFever, headache, and neurological problems, while classic, only occur in 20% of people with brain abscess.<ref name=Br2014>{{cite journal|last1=Brouwer|first1=MC|last2=Coutinho|first2=JM|last3=van de Beek|first3=D|title=Clinical characteristics and outcome of brain abscess: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Neurology|date=Mar 4, 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=806\u201313|pmid=24477107|doi=10.1212/WNL.0000000000000172}}</ref>\n\nThe famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess. These symptoms are caused by a combination of increased [[intracranial pressure]] due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, [[coma]]), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage ([[hemiparesis]], [[aphasia]] etc.). \n\nThe most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, [[mental confusion|confusion]], [[seizure]]s, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. Headache is characteristically worse at night and in the morning, as the intracranial pressure naturally increases when in the [[supine]] position. This elevation similarly stimulates the medullary vomiting center and [[area postrema]], leading to morning vomiting. \n\nOther symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of [[brain stem]] compression and [[hydrocephalus]]. [[Neurological examination]] may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis).\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n\n===Bacterial===\n[[File:Brain MRI 131749 rgbca-.png|thumb|Brain abscess after metastasis treatment.]]\nAnaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive [[anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] bacilli are the predominate bacterial [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolate]]s. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobical. The predominant organisms include: ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially ''[[Streptococcus intermedius]]''), ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Prevotella]]'', and ''[[Fusobacterium]]'' species, Enterobacteriaceae, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' species, and other anaerobes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis in children and their management |journal=Int.

There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse.  In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious.  Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place.  The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior]] cranial fossae;<ref>{{cite book | author=Macewan W | year=1893 | title=Pyogenic Infective Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord | location=Glasgow | publisher=James Maclehose and Sons }}</ref> congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the [[middle cerebral artery]];<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Ingraham FD, Matson DD | title=Neurosurgery of Infancy andChildhood | location=Springfield, Ill | publisher=Charles C Thomas | year=1954 | pages=377 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Raimondi AJ, Matsumoto S, Miller RA | title=Brain abscess in children with congenital heart disease | journal=J Neurosurg | volume=23 | pages=588\u201395 | year=1965 | doi=10.3171/jns.1965.23.6.0588 | pmid=5861142 | issue=6 }}</ref> and infection of the [[frontal sinus|frontal]] and [[ethmoid sinus|ethmoid]] sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.\n\n=== Other organisms ===\n[[fungus|Fungi]] and [[parasite]]s may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: ''[[Nocardia asteroides]]'', ''Mycobacterium'', Fungi (e.g. ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'', ''Mucorales'', ''Coccidioides'', ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'', ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'', ''Bipolaris'', ''[[Exophiala dermatitidis]]'', ''[[Curvularia pallescens]]'', ''Ochroconis gallopava'', ''Ramichloridium mackenziei'', ''[[Pseudallescheria boydii]]''), Protozoa (e.g. ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', ''[[Schistosoma]]'', ''Paragonimus''), and Helminths (e.g. ''Taenia solium''). Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with [[AIDS]] are [[poliovirus]], ''Toxoplasma gondii'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of [[meningitis]] generally predominate.\n\nThese organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions: \n*Sinus and dental infections\u2014Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. ''Prevotella'', ''Porphyromonas'', ''Bacteroides''), ''Fusobacterium'', ''S. aureus'', and Enterobacteriaceae\n*Penetrating trauma\u2014''S. aureus'', aerobic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and ''Clostridium'' spp.\n*Pulmonary infections\u2014Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. ''Prevotella'', ''Porphyromonas'', ''Bacteroides''), ''Fusobacterium'', ''Actinomyces'', and ''Nocardia''\n*Congenital heart disease\u2014Aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, and ''S. aureus''\n*HIV infection\u2014''T. gondii'', ''Mycobacterium'', ''Nocardia'', ''Cryptococcus'', and ''Listeria monocytogenes''\n*Transplantation\u2014''Aspergillus'', ''Candida'', ''Cryptococcus'', ''Mucorales'', ''Nocardia'', and ''T. gondii''\n*Neutropenia\u2014Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, ''Aspergillus'', ''Candida'', and ''Mucorales''\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:Brain Abscess at MRI (T1 + contrast) -- showing a small ring-enhancing lesion with mild surrounding edema adjacent to the ventricular catheter and ventricular dilatation..jpg|thumb|MRI (T1 with contrast) showing the ring-enhancing lesion. From a rare case report of an abscess formed as a complication of the CSF shunt. Jamjoom et al., 2009.<ref name=\"jamjoom09\"/>]]\nThe diagnosis is established by a [[computed tomography]] (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as [[cerebrit]]is), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain.  Within 4\u20135 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous [[ring-enhancing lesion]] appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). [[Lumbar puncture]] procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull ([[brain herniation]]).\n\nRing enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain [[tumor]]s. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.\n\n==Treatment==\nThe treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous [[antibiotic]]s (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).\n\n[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBO2 or HBOT) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions.\nFirstly, HBOT reduces intracranial pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membership.uhms.org/?page=IA|title=Home - Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society|publisher=}}</ref> Secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. Third, HBOT optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, HBOT has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyleitis.\n\nSecondary functions of HBOT include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of VEGF which aid in the healing and recovery process.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/ajpheart/290/4/H1378.full.pdf|title=Stem cell mobilization by hyperbaric oxygen|first1=Stephen R.|last1=Thom|first2=Veena M.|last2=Bhopale|first3=Omaida C.|last3=Velazquez|first4=Lee J.|last4=Goldstein|first5=Lynne H.|last5=Thom|first6=Donald G.|last6=Buerk|date=1 April 2006|publisher=|journal=Am.

The location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).\n\nThere are few exceptions to this rule: ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas.  These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment.  [[Tuberculosis]] can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.\n\nCT guided stereotactic aspiration is also indicated in the treatment of brain abscess. The use of pre-operative imaging, intervention with post-operative clinical and biochemical monitoring used to manage brain abscesses today dates back to the Pennybacker system pioneered by [[Somerset, Kentucky]]-born neurosurgeon Joseph Buford Pennybacker, director of the neurosurgery department of the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], [[Oxford]] from 1952 to 1971. <ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185969  ''Joseph Buford Pennybacker, C.B.E., M.D., F.R.C.S.

Her relationship with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career.<ref name=\"InitialsBB\"/><ref name=\"twolives\"/>\n\n===Career : 1952\u20131973===\nBardot debuted in a highly popular [[comedy film]] starring [[Bourvil]], ''Le Trou Normand'' (1952) (English title: ''Crazy for Love'').\n\nShe played the lead in ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]'' (1953) from director [[Willy Rozier]]. She had a small role in ''[[The Long Teeth]]'' (1953), playing Vadim's wife, then had a leading role in a comedy starring [[Jean Richard]], ''[[His Father's Portrait]]'' (1953).\n\nBardot had a small role in a Hollywood-financed film being shot in Paris, ''[[Act of Love (1953 film)|Act of Love]]'' (1953), starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. She received media attention when she attended the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1953.<ref name=\"twolives\"/>\n\nBardot had a leading role in an Italian melodrama, ''[[Concert of Intrigue]]'' (1954) and in a French adventure film, ''[[Caroline and the Rebels]]'' (1954). She had a good part as a flirtatious student in ''[[School for Love]]'' (1955), opposite [[Jean Marais]] for director [[Marc All\u00e9gret]].\n\nBardot played her first sizeable English-language role in ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' (1955), as the love interest for [[Dirk Bogarde]]. The film was the third most popular movie at the British box office that year.<ref>\"'The Dam Busters'.\" Times [London, England] 29 Dec. 1955: 12. The Times Digital Archive.

The part was bigger in ''[[The Light Across the Street]]'' (1956) for director [[Georges Lacombe (director)|Georges Lacombe]]. She did another with Hollywood film, ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'', playing Helen's handmaiden.\n\nFor the 1956 Italian movie [[Nero's Weekend|''Mio figlio Nerone'']] Bardot was asked by the director to appear as a blonde. Rather than wear a wig to hide her naturally brunette hair she decided to dye her hair. She was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the hair colour.<ref name=\"Servat.

First up was a musical, ''[[Naughty Girl (film)|Naughty Girl]]'' (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl.

More popular in France was ''[[Love on a Pillow]]'' (1962), another for Vadim.\n\n====International films====\nIn the mid-1960s Bardot made films which seemed to be more aimed at the international market. In 1963, she starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le M\u00e9pris]]'', produced by [[Joseph E. Levine]] and starring [[Jack Palance]]. The following year she co-starred with [[Anthony Perkins]] in the comedy ''[[Une ravissante idiote]]'' (1964).\n\nBardot finally appeared in a Hollywood film in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), a comedy starring [[James Stewart]] as an academic whose son develops a crush on Bardot. Bardot's appearance was relatively brief and the film was not a big hit.\n\nMore successful was the Western buddy comedy ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965) for director Louis Malle, appearing opposite [[Jeanne Moreau]]. It was a big hit in France and around the world although it did not break through in the US as much as was hoped.<ref name=\"tino\">Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 281</ref>\n\nAfter a cameo in Godard's ''[[Masculin F\u00e9minin]]'' (1966), she had her first flop in a long time, ''[[Two Weeks in September]]'' (1968), a French\u2013English co-production. She had a small role in the all-star ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]'' (1968), acting opposite [[Alain Delon]], then tried a Hollywood film again: ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'' (1968), a Western starring [[Sean Connery]], which was a box office disappointment.<ref name=\"variety\">\"ABC's 5 Years of Film Production Profits & Losses\", ''Variety'', 31 May 1973 p 3</ref>\n\n====Final films====\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot.jpg|thumb|left|Bardot in 1968]]\n''[[Les Femmes]]'' (1969) was a flop, although the screwball comedy ''[[The Bear and the Doll]]'' (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: ''[[Les Novices]]'' (1970), ''[[Boulevard du Rhum]]'' (1971) (with [[Lino Ventura]]). ''[[The Legend of Frenchie King]]'' (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with [[Claudia Cardinale]]. She made one more with Vadim, ''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]'' (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked \"Underneath what people call \"the Bardot myth\" was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom - she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression.

These instruments had varying numbers of strings, though often including some form of drone.

Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of the four main strings with the index, middle or both finger(s)while the drone or fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, there is also a style called two finger up-pick, and a three finger version that [[Earl Scruggs]] developed into the famous [[Scruggs style|\"Scruggs\" style]] picking, nationally aired in 1945 on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princetontraditional.org/Articles/Art1502.htm |publisher=Princeton Traditional Music Festival |title=Banjoes Rang Out |access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n\nWhile five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, [[Banjo#Tenor banjo|tenor banjo]]s and [[plectrum banjo]]s are played with a pick, either to strum full chords or, most commonly in [[Irish Traditional Music]], play single note melodies.\n\n== Modern banjo ==\nThe modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a [[guitar]], has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast [[arpeggiated]] plucking, though there are many different playing styles.\n\nThe body, or ''pot'', of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal \"tone ring\" assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.\n\nThe banjo is usually tuned with friction [[tuning peg]]s or [[planetary gear]] tuners, rather than the [[worm gear]] [[machine head]] used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute [[glissando]], play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.\n\nModern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string is [[Strings (music)#Winding|wound]] with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.\n\n=== Open-back and resonator ===\nSome banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in [[bluegrass music]], though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.\n\nOpen-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher [[Action (music)|string action]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.promusicinternational.co.uk/ozark-2102g-5-string-open-back-banjo-2102g/dp/3108|title=Ozark 2102G 5-String Open Back Banjo : Pro Music International|website=Promusicinternational.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060339/http://www.promusicinternational.co.uk/ozark-2102g-5-string-open-back-banjo-2102g/dp/3108|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Five-string banjo == <!-- This section is linked from redirect \"[[Five-string banjo]]\" -->\nThe modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three quarters the length of the other strings. This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a [[reentrant tuning]]\u2014the string pitches don't proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is highest.\n\nThe short fifth string presents special problems for a [[capo]]. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example) it is possible simply to re-tune the fifth string. Otherwise, various devices called ''fifth string capos'' effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use model railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), that they hook the string under to press it down on the [[fret]].\n\nFive-string banjo players use many tunings. (Tunings are given in left-to-right order, as viewed from the front of the instrument with the neck pointing up.) Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning G4 D3 G3 B3 D4. In earlier times, the tuning G4 C3 G3 B3 D4 was commonly used instead, and this is still the preferred tuning for some types of folk music and for [[classic banjo]]. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (G4 C3 G3 C4 D4), \"sawmill\" (G4 D3 G3 C4 D4) also called \"mountain modal\" and open D (F#4D3 F#3 A3 D4). These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a [[capo]]. For example, \"double-D\" tuning (A4 D3 A3 D4 E4) \u2013 commonly reached by tuning up from double C \u2013 is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D and Open-A (A4 E3 A3 C#4 E4) is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A. There are dozens of other banjo tunings, used mostly in old-time music. These tunings are used to make it easier to play specific tunes, usually fiddle tunes or groups of fiddle tunes.\n\nThe size of the five-string banjo is largely standardized\u2014but smaller and larger sizes exist, including the long-neck or ''Seeger neck'' variation designed by [[Pete Seeger]]. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the [[banjeaurine]], tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many makers have produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.\n\n[[File:Don Wayne Reno playing the banjo with fingerpicks.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A five-string banjo.]]\n\nAmerican [[old-time music]] typically uses the five-string open back banjo. It is played in a number of different styles, the most common being [[clawhammer]] or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward stroke when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a [[drone (music)|drone]] after most [[strums]] or after each stroke (\"double thumbing\"), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as ''drop-thumb.'' [[Pete Seeger]] popularised a [[Folk music|folk]] style by combining clawhammer with ''up picking'', usually without the use of [[fingerpick]]s. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is ''Fingerpicking banjo'' or ''classic banjo''. This style is based upon [[parlor-style guitar]].<ref name=\"Trischka\">Trischka, Tony (1992). ''Banjo Songbook'', p.20. {{ISBN|0-8256-0197-5}}.</ref>\n\n[[Bluegrass music]], which uses the five-string resonator banjo almost exclusively, is played in several common styles. These include [[Scruggs style]], named after [[Earl Scruggs]]; melodic, or [[Keith style]], named for [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and three-finger style with single string work, also called Reno style after [[Don Reno]]. In these styles the emphasis is on arpeggiated figures played in a continuous eighth-note rhythm, known as [[banjo roll|rolls]]. All of these styles are typically played with [[fingerpick]]s.\n\nThe first five-string electric solid-body banjo was developed by [[Buck Trent|Charles (Buck) Wilburn Trent]], Harold \"Shot\" Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960.\n\n===Classical and modern===\n\nThe five-string banjo has been used in classical music since before the turn of the 20th century. [[contemporary classical music|Contemporary and modern]] works have been written or arranged for the instrument by [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Buck Trent]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]], [[Tony Trischka]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Steve Martin]], [[George Crumb]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Jo Kondo]], [[Paul Elwood]], [[Hans Werner Henze]] (notably in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Henze)|Sixth Symphony]]), Daniel Mason of [[Hank Williams III]]'s Damn Band, [[Beck]], [[the Water Tower Bucket Boys]], [[Todd Taylor (banjo player)|Todd Taylor]], [[J.P. Pickens]], Peggy Honeywell, [[Norfolk & Western]], Putnam Smith, [[Iron & Wine]], [[The Avett Brothers]], [[The Well Pennies]], [[Punch Brothers]], [[Julian Koster]] and [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Frederick Delius]] wrote for a banjo in his opera [[Koanga]].\n\n[[Ernst Krenek]] includes two banjos in his Kleine Symphonie (Little Symphony).\n\n[[Kurt Weill]] has a banjo in his opera [[The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]].\n\n[[Viktor Ullmann]] included a tenor banjo part in his Piano Concerto (op. 25).\n\n==Four-string banjos{{anchor|four_string}}==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Item-ps-250-(plectrum-special)-1458 lg.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Plectrum banjo from Gold Tone]]\n\n{{See also|Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame Members}}\n\nFour-string banjos, both plectrum and tenor, can be used for chordal accompaniment (as in early jazz), for single string melody playing (as in Irish traditional music), in \"chord melody\" style (a succession of chords in which the highest notes carry the melody), in tremolo style (both on chords and single strings), and a mixed technique called duo style that combines single string tremolo and rhythm chords.\n\n===Plectrum banjo===\nThe '''plectrum banjo''' is a standard banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28&nbsp;inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as \"Chicago tuning.\" As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style [[plectrum|pick]] (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a [[thumbpick]] and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.\n\nThe four-string banjo is used from time to time in musical theater. Examples include: ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence]]'', ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'', ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Spamalot]]'', and countless others. [[Joe Raposo]] had used it variably in the imaginative 7-piece orchestration for the long-running TV show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an [[electric guitar]]. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show's arrangement currently.\n\n===Tenor banjo===\n[[File:Riverside Stompers - Peter Schwanzer solo - Dieter Bietak 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Four-string banjo in [[Austria]]]]\n[[File:Item-it-250f-(irish-tenor)-1419 lg.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Irish tenor banjo from Gold Tone]]\nThe shorter-necked, '''tenor banjo''', with 17 (\"short scale\") or 19 frets, is also typically played with a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19\u00bd to 21\u00bd&nbsp;inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21\u00be to 23&nbsp;inches became standard. The usual tuning is the [[all-fifths tuning]] C3 G3 D4 A4, in which there are exactly seven [[semitone]]s (a [[perfect fifth]]) between the [[open note]]s of consecutive [[open string (music)|string]]s. Other players (particularly in [[Irish traditional music]]) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an [[octave mandolin]], which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deeringbanjos.com/blogs/banjo-playing-tips/10152829-the-symmetrical-tuning-of-the-tenor-banjo | title=The Tenor Banjo | publisher=Deering Banjo Company | date=14 November 2013 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Bandrowski, David}}</ref> The popularisation of this tuning was usually attributed to the late [[Barney McKenna]], banjoist with [[The Dubliners]].<ref name=meade>{{cite web | url=http://blarneystar.com/BANJO_030912X.pdf | title=The Irish Tenor Banjo|website=Blarneystar.com | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Meade, Don}}</ref> Fingerstyle on tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) have been explored by Mirek Patek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirekpatek.com |title=Patek style tenor banjo |publisher=Mirekpatek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110220432/http://mirekpatek.com/ |archivedate=10 January 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe tenor banjo was a common rhythm-instrument in early 20th-century dance-bands. Its volume and timbre suited early jazz (and jazz-influenced popular music styles) and could both compete with other instruments (such as [[brass instruments]] and [[saxophone]]s) and be heard clearly on acoustic recordings. [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', in [[Ferde Grofe]]'s original jazz orchestra arrangement, includes tenor banjo, with widely spaced chords not easily playable on plectrum banjo in its conventional tuning(s). With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional \"Dixieland\" jazz.\n\nSome 1920s Irish banjo players picked out the melodies of jigs, reels and hornpipes on tenor banjos, decorating the tunes with snappy triplet ornaments. The most important Irish banjo player of this era was Mike Flanagan of the New York-based [[Flanagan Brothers]], one of the most popular Irish-American groups of the day. Other pre-WW2 Irish banjo players included Neil Nolan, who recorded with Dan Sullivan's Shamrock Band in Boston, and Jimmy McDade, who recorded with the Four Provinces Orchestra in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Ireland the rise of \"ceili\" bands provided a new market for a loud instrument like the tenor banjo. Use of the tenor banjo in Irish music has increased greatly since the folk revival of the 1960s.<ref name=meade/>\n\n===Low banjos===\n[[File:Cello banjo from Gold Tone.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Cello banjo from Gold Tone]]In the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was a vogue in plucked-string instrument ensembles\u2014guitar orchestras, mandolin orchestras, banjo orchestras\u2014in which the instrumentation was made to parallel that of the string section in symphony orchestras. Thus \"violin, viola, 'cello, bass\" became \"mandolin, mandola, mandocello, mandobass\", or in the case of banjos, \"banjolin, banjola, banjo cello, bass banjo\".

It's normally tuned C2-G2-D3-A3, one octave below the tenor banjo like the cello and mandocello. It played a role in banjo orchestras in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A five-string cello banjo, set up like a bluegrass banjo (with the short 5th string), but tuned one octave lower, has been produced by the Goldtone company.<ref>{{cite web|author=Insert name |url=http://www.goldtone.com/products/details/w/instrument/374/CEB-5 |title=CEB-5 &#124; Gold Tone Music Group |publisher=Goldtone.com |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417124803/http://www.goldtone.com/products/details/w/instrument/374/CEB-5 |archivedate=17 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Bass and contrabass banjo====\n[[File:1930's Gibson bass banjo ad.jpg|thumb|140px|Bass banjo]] Bass banjos have been produced in both upright bass formats and with standard, horizontally carried banjo bodies.

Tuning varies on these large instruments, with four-string models sometimes being tuned in 4ths like a bass violin\u2014E1-A1-D2-G2, and sometimes in 5ths, like a four-string cello banjo, one octave lower\u2014C1-G1-D2-A2. Other variants are also used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minstrelbanjo.ning.com/photo/contra-bass-banjo?xg_source=activity |title=Contra bass banjo - Minstrel Banjo |publisher=Minstrelbanjo.ning.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2016-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Six-string banjos==\n[[File:Banjo.png|left|thumb|300px|Old six-string zither banjo]]\n\nThe six-string banjo began as a British innovation by William Temlet, one of England's earliest banjo makers. He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold banjos with closed backs and up to seven strings. He marketed these as \"zither\" Banjos from his 1869 patent. American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862\u20131949), a young violinist-turned banjo concert player, devised the five or six-string zither banjo around 1880. It had a wood resonator and metal \"wire\" strings (the 1st and 2nd melody strings and 5th \"thumb\" string. The 3rd melody string was gut and the 4th was silk covered) as well as frets and guitar-style tuning machines.\n\nA zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, the neck and string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg could be mounted on the peg head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo. British [[opera]] diva [[Adelina Patti]] advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make sophisticated music than normally played by [[blackface]] minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music. (Supposedly unknown to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a seven-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a \"zither-banjo.\"){{rn|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn the late 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes developed a six-string version of the banjo, with the 6th string \"tunnelled\" through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor influenced development and perfection of the zither banjo and created the open-back banjo<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zither-banjo.org/pages/windsornew.htm |title=Windsor Banjos |publisher=Zither-banjo.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-31}}</ref> along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the modern non-solid attached resonator. (Gibson claims credit for this modification on the American Continent.) Windsor claimed he created the hollow neck banjo with a truss rod, and buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head rather than in the neck. Gibson claims credit for perfecting the tone ring.\n\nModern six-string bluegrass banjos have been made. These add a bass string between the lowest string and the drone string on a five-string banjo, and are usually tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4. [[Sonny Osborne]] played one of these instruments for several years. It was modified by luthier Rual Yarbrough from a Vega five-string model. A picture of Sonny with this banjo appears in Pete Wernick's ''Bluegrass Banjo'' method book.<ref>Wernick, Pete; ''Bluegrass Banjo''; Oak Publications; Oakland, California: 1992, p. 27. 0-825-60148-7</ref>\n\nSix-string banjos having a guitar neck and a banjo body have become quite popular since the mid-1990s. See under ''Banjo Hybrids and variants'', below.\n\n==Banjo hybrids and variants==\nA number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the [[Banjo Mandolin|banjo mandolin]] (first patented in 1882)<ref name=paper>{{cite web|url=http://blarneystar.com/BANJO_030912X.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Irish Tenor Banjo |author=Don Meade |website=Blarneystar.com |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> and the [[banjo ukulele]] or [[banjolele]], most famously played by the English comedian [[George Formby]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4029395.ece | location=London (subscription required)| work=The Times | title=George Formbys Little Strad banjolele up for sale | date=2008-05-30}}</ref> These were especially popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.\n\nThe six-string [[banjo guitar]] basically consists of a six-string guitar neck attached to a bluegrass or plectrum banjo body. This was the instrument of the early jazz great [[Johnny St. Cyr]], jazzmen [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Danny Barker]], [[Papa Charlie Jackson]] and [[Clancy Hayes]], as well as the blues and gospel singer The [[Reverend Gary Davis]]. Nowadays, it appears under various names such as guitanjo, guitjoe, ganjo, banjitar, or bantar. Today, musicians as diverse as [[Keith Urban]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[David Hidalgo]], [[Larry Lalonde]] and [[Doc Watson]] play the six-string guitar banjo.\nRhythm guitarist [[Dave Day]] of 1960s proto-punks [[The Monks]] replaced his guitar with a six-string, gut-strung guitar banjo on which he played guitar chords. This instrument sounds much more metallic, scratchy and wiry than a standard electric guitar, due to its amplification via a small microphone stuck inside the banjo's body.\n\nInstruments that have a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, [[bouzouki]], or [[dobro]] body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] instrument similar to the banjo is called the [[c\u00fcmb\u00fc\u015f]]. At the end of the twentieth century, a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helmutrheingans.co.uk/bansitar |title=Bansitar |website=Helmutrheingans.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a [[sitar]]-like resonance. A recent innovation is the patented Banjo-Tam, invented by Frank Abrams of Asheville North Carolina combining a traditional five string banjo neck with a tambourine as a rim or ''pot''.\n\n==Notable banjoists==\n{{Main article|List of banjo players}}\n* {{Hanging indent| text=[[Vess Ossman]] (1868\u20131923) was a leading five-string banjoist whose career spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) are to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases\u2014having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"[[Run (baseball)|runs]]\". The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"[[Out (baseball)|out]]\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]] and [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n==Rules and gameplay==\n{{Further|Baseball rules|Outline of baseball}}\n[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field).

A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] in college and minor leagues, and six innings at the Little League level).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rules-regulations-policies/|title=Rules, Regulations, and Policies - Little League|last=League|first=Little|work=Little League|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}</ref> One team\u2014customarily the visiting team\u2014bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must proceed [[counterclockwise]] to first base, second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring and record [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]] comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.<ref>Thurston (2000), p. 15; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|title=Official Rules/Foreword|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124020327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|archivedate=24 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.01\u20131.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/4.00\u2014Starting and Ending a Game (Rule 4.10)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height.

On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.

At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs.

In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.<ref>Mount, Nicholas James, \"Team Sports\", in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".<ref>Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.</ref> Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar [[Michael Mandelbaum]] argues that \"baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports\".<ref>Mandelbaum (2005), p. 55.</ref> Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum,\n\n<blockquote>It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.<ref name=\"Mandelbaum5557\">Mandelbaum (2005), pp. 55\u201357.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.<ref>Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157\u2013158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.\"</ref>\n\n=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===\n{{Further|Baseball park}}\n[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]] is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game.

For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}</ref> There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 219.</ref> A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner.

Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude\u2014{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level\u2014is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.<ref>Keri (2007), pp. 295\u2013301.</ref> [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n{{Further|Baseball statistics}}\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports.

One of the first major examples, [[Ernest Thayer]]'s poem \"[[Casey at the Bat]]\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of [[vaudeville]] and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many [[baseball movie]]s, including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]\u2013winning ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942) and the Oscar nominees ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989). The [[American Film Institute]]'s selection of the ten best sports movies includes ''The Pride of the Yankees'' at number 3 and ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988) at number 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/sports.html|title=AFI 10 Top 10\u2014Top 10 Sports|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|date=June 17, 2008|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage\u2014the [[Richard Adler|Adler]]\u2013[[Jerry Ross (composer)|Ross]] musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]''\u2014and record\u2014[[George J.

The 1970 publication of major league pitcher [[Jim Bouton]]'s tell-all chronicle ''[[Ball Four]]'' is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neyer, Rob|author-link=Rob Neyer|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/ballfour/neyer.html|title='Ball Four' Changed Sports ''and'' Books|publisher=ESPN.com|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>\n\nBaseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. [[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late 19th century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards\u2014many of which are now prized collectibles\u2014are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.<ref>Zoss (2004), pp. 16\u201325.</ref>\n\nModern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[Fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as [[fantasy baseball]], it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports.<ref>Zoss (2004), pp. 27\u201331.</ref> The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites.
